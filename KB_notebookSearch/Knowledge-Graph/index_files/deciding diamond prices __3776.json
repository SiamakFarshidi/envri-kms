The next grade has a very slight trace of color These are graded as E color or F color diamonds. Slightly colored diamonds are graded as I or J or K color. Diamonds which show very little traces of color are graded as G or H color diamonds.

Diamonds are such a highly traded commodity that multiple organizations have been created for grading and certifying them based on the four Cs which are color cut clarity and carat. One carat is defined as 200 milligrams. Other characteristics such as presence or lack of fluorescence also affect the desirability and thus the value of a diamond used for jewelry.
