Heart sounds analysis and classification with LSTM BackgroundHeart sounds are the noises generated by the beating heart and the resultant flow of blood through it. However in some situations extrasystoles can be caused by heart diseases. com heartchallenge This is my first attempt to create a deep learning classification model based on RNN LSTM as a primary choice. In general a 39 dimensional feature vector is used which is composed of first 13 MFCCs and their corresponding 13 delta and 13 delta delta. padd missing lenght for file smaller than 5 seconds. RNN and LSTM are memory bandwidth limited problems Temporal convolutional network TCN outperform canonical recurrent networks such as LSTMs across a diverse range of tasks and datasets while demonstrating longer effective memory. Data is gathered in real world situations and frequently contains background noise of every conceivable type. The differences between heart sounds corresponding to different heart symptoms can also be extremely subtle and challenging to separate. Take the discrete cosine transform of the list of mel log powers as if it were a signal. Normal caseIn the Normal category there are normal healthy heart sounds. The memory blocks are responsible for remembering things and manipulations to this memory is done through three major mechanisms called gates. This is not the same as an extra heart sound as the event is not regularly occuring. Fast Fourier transforms are also likely to provide useful information about volume and frequency over time.

Onset strength at time t is determined by mean_f max 0 S f t ref_S f t lag where ref_S is S after local max filtering along the frequency axis 1. MFCC Windowing features eg. By default if a time series y is provided S will be the log power Mel spectrogram. Of these deaths an estimated 7. Any method which can help to detect signs of heart disease c The problem is of particular interest to machine learning researchers as it involves classification of audio sample data where distinguishing between classes of interest is non trivial. More domain specific knowledge about the difference between the categories of sounds is provided below. Sound Feature Onset onset detectorBasic onset detector. Loading DataLoading od the audio data file will be based on content from directory since each filename is associate with the category type. cheers Reference Classifying Heart Sounds Challenge http www. If these diseases are detected earlier then treatment is likely to be more effective. It can happen normally in an adult and can be very common in children. Source Classifying Heart Sounds Challenge http www. png LSTM network is comprised of different memory blocks called cells the rectangles that we see in the image. Another way of representing audio data is by converting it into a different domain of data representation namely the frequency domain. A normal heart sound has a clear lub dub lub dub pattern with the time from lub to dub shorter than the time from dub to the next lub when the heart rate is less than 140 beats per minute source Rita Getz 2. An extrasystole may not be a sign of disease. 1 million people died from CVDs in 2004 representing 29 of all global deaths. Despite its medical significance to date this is a relatively unexplored application for machine learning. 2 million were due to coronary heart disease. Extrasystole Extrasystole sounds may appear occasionally and can be identified because there is a heart sound that is out of rhythm involving extra or skipped heartbeats e. This category is the most different from the others. Success in classifying this form of data requires extremely robust classifiers. Deep learning RNN Recurrent Neural Networks LSTM Long Short Term Memory image. png https s3 ap south 1. source Rita Getz 3. This function can be used to roll back the timing of detected onsets from a detected peak amplitude to the preceding minimum. frequency domain https s3 ap south 1. This frequency warping can allow for better representation of sound for example in audio compression. Data Handling in Audio domainAs with all unstructured data formats audio data has a couple of preprocessing steps which have to be followed before it is presented for analysis. Based on directory content approach will be more flexible. Mel frequency cepstral coefficients MFCCs are coefficients that collectively make up an MFC. Map the powers of the spectrum obtained above onto the mel scale using triangular overlapping windows. The MFCCs are the amplitudes of the resulting spectrum. RMSE of waveform Frequency domain features eg. This is most useful when using onsets to determine slice points for segmentation onset strengthCompute a spectral flux onset strength envelope. Sound Feature MFCC Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient MFCC is by far the most successful feature used in the field of Speech Processing. Problem An estimated 17. Amplitude of individual freuencies Perceptual features eg. com heartchallenge. welcome any auggestion or question. They may also contain occasional random noise corresponding to breathing or brushing the microphone against clothing or skin. One of the things that confuses non medically trained people is that murmurs happen between lub and dub or between dub and lub not on lub and not on dub. source Rita Getz 5. It is common to apply a low pass filter at 195 Hz. There are usually no discernable heart sounds and thus little or no temporal periodicity at frequencies below 195 Hz. let s check what is inside each directory and content and input data organizationCheck input data in csv filesNote nan label indicate unclassified and unlabel test files let s take a look some sample by category 1. There are two states that are being transferred to the next cell the cell state and the hidden state. In healthy adults there are two normal heart sounds often described as a lub and a dub or dup that occur in sequence with each heartbeat. source Rita Getz Audio Lengththe lengths of the audio files in the dataset varies from 1 to 30 seconds long. hence we can use csv file for cross reference check. for training purpose we use first 5 seconds of the audio. Speech is a non stationary signal. As such normal signal processing techniques cannot be directly applied to it. MFCCs are commonly derived as follows Take the Fourier transform of a windowed excerpt of a signal. The peak_pick parameters were chosen by large scale hyper parameter optimization over the dataset provided onset_backtrackBacktrack detected onset events to the nearest preceding local minimum of an energy function. com av blog media wp content uploads 2017 08 23212155 time_freq. The difference between the cepstrum and the mel frequency cepstrum is that in the MFC the frequency bands are equally spaced on the mel scale which approximates the human auditory system s response more closely than the linearly spaced frequency bands used in the normal cepstrum. pngThere are a few more ways in which audio data can be represented. They may contain a variety of background noises from traffic to radios. Locate note onset events by picking peaks in an onset strength envelope. It is important to be able to distinguish this category from the other three categories so that someone gathering the data can be instructed to try again. These are the first heart sound S1 and second heart sound S2 produced by the closing of the atrioventricular valves and semilunar valves respectively. They can be a symptom of many heart disorders some serious. http Here s we go. using MFCs Mel Frequency cepstrums General Audio Features Time Domain features eg. These may contain noise in the final second of the recording as the device is removed from the body. There will still be a lub and a dub. Extra Heart Sound In the Artifact category there are a wide range of different sounds including feedback squeals and echoes speech music and noise. Explorer dataThe audio files are of varying lengths between 1 second and 30 seconds some have been clipped to reduce excessive noise and provide the salient fragment of the sound. They are derived from a type of cepstral representation of the audio clip a nonlinear spectrum of a spectrum. Murmur Heart murmurs sound as though there is a whooshing roaring rumbling or turbulent fluid noise in one of two temporal locations 1 between lub and dub or 2 between dub and lub. a lub lub dub or a lub dub dub. The goal of this notebook is optimized the model for better accuracy overtime. Hamming distances of windows After extracting these features it is then sent to the machine learning model for further analysis. Most information in heart sounds is contained in the low frequency components with noise in the higher frequencies. Artifact In the Artifact category there are a wide range of different sounds including feedback squeals and echoes speech music and noise.
