In addition try and get or stay healthy. The prostate surrounds the urethra. ImmunotherapyWe will see the distribution of data providers Gleason Score and ISUP Grade The grading process consists of finding and classifying cancer tissue into so called Gleason patterns 3 4 or 5. They can travel through blood vessels or lymph nodes to reach other parts of the body. Your treatment plan will depend on The stage and grade of the cancer Gleason score and TNM stage Your risk category whether the cancer is low intermediate or high risk Your age and health Your preferences with respect to side effects long term effects and treatment goals Results from other diagnostic tests will help your provider understand if the cancer can spread or recur return after treatment.

At the same time fluid from the prostate and the seminal vesicles also moves into the urethra. Even though there is no known reason for prostate cancer there are many risks associated with the disease. After the biopsy is assigned a Gleason score it is converted into an ISUP grade on a 1 5 scale. Eating a well balanced diet maintaining a healthy weight exercising and not smoking are all important factors when fighting prostate cancer. Damage to the genetic material DNA of prostate cells is more likely for men over the age of 55. Today 99 of men with prostate cancer will live for at least 5 years after diagnosis.

You may need to see another urologist oncologist or radiation oncologist. Eight out of ten autopsy cancers found are small with tumors that are not harmful.
