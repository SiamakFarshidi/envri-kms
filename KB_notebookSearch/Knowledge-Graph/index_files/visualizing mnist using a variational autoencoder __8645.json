Split into new training validation sets D. I learned that variational autoencoders VAEs can be used to visualize high dimensional data in a meaningful lower dimensional space. png VAEs have received a lot of attention because of their generative ability though they seem to be falling out of fashion in favor of general adversarial networks or GANs in that regard. Introduction I spent a rainy weekend recently learning about autoencoders using TensorFlow and Keras in Python. We can calculate this loss on a validation set with each training epoch as an estimate of how the model describes data it was not trained on. Thanks for reading generic backend so code works with either tensorflow or theano create label column in test dataset rearrange so that columns are in the same order as in train combine original train and test sets Hold out 5000 random images as a validation test sample free up some space and delete test and combined X s labels Normalize and reshape for MNIST Number of latent dimension parameters Encoder architecture Input Conv2D 4 Flatten Dense need to know the shape of the network here for the decoder Two outputs latent mean and log variance sampling function sample vector from the latent distribution decoder takes the latent distribution sample as input Expand to 784 total pixels reshape use Conv2DTranspose to reverse the conv layers from the encoder decoder model statement apply the decoder to the sample from the latent distribution construct a custom layer to calculate the loss Reconstruction loss KL divergence adds the custom loss to the class apply the custom loss to the input images and the decoded latent distribution sample VAE model statement Isolate original training set records in validation set X s and Y s Reshape and normalize Translate into the latent space set colormap so that 11 s are gray Display a 2D manifold of the digits figure with 20x20 digits Construct grid of latent variable values decode for each square in the grid. In training the autoencoder we re optimizing the parameters of the neural networks to minimize the loss or distance and we do that by stochastic gradient descent yet another topic for another post. Instead they learn the parameters of the probability distribution that the data came from. We want to train the autoencoder with as many images as possible. Now we can instantiate the model and take a look at its summary. In this kernel I go over some details about autoencoding and autoencoders especially VAEs before constructing and training a deep VAE on the MNIST data from the Digit Recognizer competition. Encoder network B. It s considered more of a semi supervised learning method as opposed to a truly unsupervised one since it s not entirely targetless. As we ll see VAEs can also be used to cluster data in useful ways. Autoencoders Generally autoencoders have three parts an encoder a decoder and a loss function that maps one to the other. We ll need to separate the inputs from the labels normalize them by dividing the max pixel value and reshape them into 28x28 pixel images. Reconstruction loss This is the cross entropy describing the errors between the decoded samples from the latent distribution and the original inputs. Sample digits Another fun thing we can do is to use the decoder network to take a peak at what samples from the latent space look like as we change the latent variables. We ll see how the data cluster in the lower dimensional space according to their digit class. A variational autoencoder https i. com brilliantFire deep learning with python notebooks. Variational autoencoders VAEs don t learn to morph the data in and out of a compressed representation of itself like the vanilla autoencoders I described above. The Lambda layer wrapper let s us do this. Typically when people are talking about autoencoders they re talking about ones where the encoders and decoders are neural networks in our case deep convnets. Model construction A. The code here borrows heavily from Fran ccedil ois Chollet s example VAE from his book Deep Learning with Python https www. Since they learn about the distribution the inputs came from we can sample from that distribution to generate novel data. The encoder and decoder learn models that are in terms of underlying unobserved latent variables. In fact the hidden layers of simple autoencoders are doing something like principal component analysis PCA another method traditionally used for dimensionality reduction. The Variational Variety There s a bunch of different kinds of autoencoders but for this post I m going to concentrate on one type called a variational autoencoder. In practice you re much more likely to see them being used to preprocess data as in denoising think images but it doesn t have to be or for dimensionality reduction. The Kullback Liebler divergence between the latent distribution and the prior this acts as a sort of regularization term. With Keras everything has to be in a layer to compile correctly. Visualizing MNIST with a Deep Variational Autoencoder1. What we end up with is a smoothly varying space where each digit transforms into the others as we dial the latent variables up and down. An encoder that that learns the parameters mean and variance of the underlying latent distribution 2. We ll give all the test images a label of 11 for now This data goes to 11. Despite all this talk of data compression autoencoders aren t typically used for that purpose. Combine Train Test Let s add a placeholder label column to the test dataset. Train the VAE Finally we fit the model. You ll notice that the encoder below has two output layers one for the latent distribution mean z_mu and the other for its variance z_log_sigma. Also since we don t need the labels for building the model remember semi supervised it makes sense to combine the train and test data into one combined dataframe. We can take a look at a few random images. Combine train test C. This goes for our sampling function. Decoder network The decoder is basically the encoder in reverse. What is autoencoding Autoencoding is much like what it sounds in the sense that the input and output are essentially the same. Reshape normalize 3. This has the effect of translating the images from the 784 dimensional input space into the 2 dimensional latent space. One of the assumptions underlying a VAE like this is that our data arose from a random process and is normally distributed in the latent space. com Deep Learning Python Francois Chollet dp 1617294438 ref sr_1_1 ie UTF8 qid 1520470984 sr 8 1 keywords francois chollet. When we color code those translated data points according to their known digit class we can see how the digits cluster together. You can find a repo of examples from the book including the one that inspired this kernel here on GitHub https github. Sampling function Next we create a function to sample from the distribution we just learned the parameters of. Reshape normalize Our encoder and decoder are deep convnets constructed using the Keras Functional API. In this example both the encoder and decoder networks are deep convnets. Decoder network D. Including the original test set data lets us see where they fall with respect to the known digit clusters. Plotting the test set data in this space shows where the images with unknown digit classes fall with respect to the known digit classes. Instead it learns the targets from the data itself. What is autoencoding B. epsilon is a tensor of small random normal values. Sampling function C. We define a custom layer class that calculates the loss. It s an algorithm for data compression where the functions for compression and decompression are learned from the data. Clustering of digits in the latent space B. Remember that we ve combined the original train and test data so the new train and validation sets that we make below will each have some images with missing 11 labels. A means of sampling from that distribution and 3. Data preparation A. Encoder network A VAE has three basic parts 1. The Variational Variety 2. Loss We need one more thing and that s something that will calculate the unique loss function the VAE requires. It s essentially an inference model and a generative model daisy chained together. For the simplest autoencoders the sort that compress and then reconstruct the original inputs from the compressed representation we can think of the loss as describing the amount of information lost in the process of reconstruction. A decoder that can turn the sample from 2 back into an image. The bottom right panel shows one of the more difficult to classify digits even for humans. Split into training validation sets Despite being trained in a semi supervised way the VAE algorithm entails minimizing a loss function. Clustering of digits in the latent space We can make predictions on the validation set using the encoder network. These types of autoencoders have much in common with latent factor analysis if you know something about that. Recall that the VAE is trained using a loss function with two components 1.
