Update on 2020 07 17 Corrected code on prior for smoothness of imputation for PCR positive rate Increased sample size of gradient for better approximation by variational inference Update on 2020 07 16 Changed detection rate by PCR to be time varying monotonically decreasing with positive rate of a coming week Corrected a mistake in implementation that sum of distribution of flow from infectious state is not 1. time varying effective contact rate per patient per day time varying detection rate by PCR monotonically decreasing with positive rate of a coming week explicit delay in getting detectable infectious hospitalized recovered and fatal separation of exposed detectable infectious and hospitalized state separation of recovery without hospitalization from discharge from hospital Considered detection rate of infected patient by PCR and fatality as observation model of Bayesian state space model. set_ylim q_ts_dic E_out data N_train.
