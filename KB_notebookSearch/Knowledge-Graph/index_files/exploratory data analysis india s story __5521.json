I will dig into this a bit more after exploring the breakdown by country. read_csv From https deparkes. The distribution for mixed gender groups of borrowers is much more widespread 6. 5 IQR percentage of loans above upper whisker. 1 of all loans in the entire sample take more than a 100 days to be funded 7. Distribution of Loan duration4. linear algebra data processing CSV file I O e. After this initial analysis I will go into borrower profiles and how Kiva can use these to make decisions about disbursing loans. uk 2016 11 04 sort pandas boxplot use dict comprehension to create new dataframe from the iterable groupby object each group name becomes a column in the new dataframe find and sort the median values in this new dataframe use the columns in the dataframe ordered sorted by median value return axes so changes can be made outside the function Q3 1. Distribution of Loan Amount We will consider the funded_amount variable as this is the amount which is disbursed to the borrower by the field agent As all amounts are in USD no currency conversion is required Most of the values are below 2000 with 8 of all loans lying above this value 6. It will be interesting to see what kind of sectors the loans in these countries were made for In Afghanistan there were only 2 loans disbursed with amounts between 6 000 and 8 000 and both of them were for Textile activity.

Distribution of number of lenders Most loans have between 1 to 150 lenders with some outliers having large numbers of lenders with the maximum number of lenders being 2986 5. On the other end of the spectrum are countries like Nigeria which has the lowest distribution. A possible explanation for Nigeria is that the value of the dollar against the Nigerian naira is so high that even small loan amounts in dollar value go a long way Time taken to fund loansThe loan disbursal process works like this in Kiva the field agent disburses the loan to the borrower at the disbursed_time. There is only one case where the posted time is 17 days greater than the funded time. Number of Loans By Country2. Lenders are then able to see the loan on Kiva and make contributions towards it.

Distribution of Loan Amount 6. 5 Loan amount by Sector 6. 3 Distribution of time taken for a loan to be funded greater than 100 days 7. 6 Loan Amount by Gender The distribution of loan amount show slightly lower amounts for female only borrowers than for male only borrowers.

The longest time it took for a loan to get funded was 1 year and 2 months Most of the loans are funded within a 100 days. 5 Is there any difference in the time taken to fund a loan based on the country of the borrower Countries are sorted in the increasing order of their median time to fund Countries like Afghanistan and Chile are on the lower end of the spectrum.
