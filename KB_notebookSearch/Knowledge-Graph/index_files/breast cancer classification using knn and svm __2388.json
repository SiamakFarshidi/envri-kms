This database is also available through the UW CS ftp server ftp ftp. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. For example running this by clicking run or pressing Shift Enter will list all files under the input directory Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output. 17 which is an awesome score. This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed It is defined by the kaggle python docker image https github. 36 with the KNN model and 86. edu cd math prog cpo dataset machine learn WDBC Also can be found on UCI Machine Learning Repository https archive. Giving a look to the confusion matrix Now we will be using SVM as our second model and then we will compare the accuracy with the KNN model. Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate FNA of a breast mass. We have got an accuracy score of 89. read_csv Input data files are available in the. edu ml datasets Breast Cancer Wisconsin 28Diagnostic 29Attribute Information 1 ID number 2 Diagnosis M malignant B benign 3 32 Ten real valued features are computed for each cell nucleus a radius mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter b texture standard deviation of gray scale values c perimeter d area e smoothness local variation in radius lengths f compactness perimeter 2 area 1. n the 3 dimensional space is that described in K. 17 with the SVM model. All feature values are recoded with four significant digits. For instance field 3 is Mean Radius field 13 is Radius SE field 23 is Worst Radius.
