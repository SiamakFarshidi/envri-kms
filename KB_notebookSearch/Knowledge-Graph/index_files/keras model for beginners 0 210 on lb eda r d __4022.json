Keras is simple frameworks where we can initialize the model and keep stacking the layers we want. Sentinet 1 sat is at about 680 Km above earth. We have been given \u03c3o directly in the data. Much better frameworks then others. Though the score may be different here it works good on LB I got 0. You may try and see but for me they are not giving any good results. pdfHowever their data have much better resolution so I don t feel that the CNN they used would be suitable here. That s a cool looking iceberg we have. The shape of the ship is going to be like a point may be like a elongated point. de 99079 2 2016_BENTES_Frost_Velotto_Tings_EUSAR_FP. Now coming to features for the purpose of this demo code I am extracting all two bands and taking avg of them as 3rd channel to create a 3 channel RGB equivalent. Don t ask why VV is not given because Sentinel don t have V ping transmitter. This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed It is defined by the kaggle python docker image https github. For example running this by clicking run or pressing Shift Enter will list the files in the input directory Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output. We don t have much resolution in images to visualize the shape of the ship. However CNN is here to help. com simple explanation of semi supervised learning and pseudo labeling c2218e8c769bUpvote if you liked this kernel. Here is the article related to that https towardsdatascience. This kernel is specifically is for Beginners who want s to experiment building CNN using Keras. You will enjoy for sure. AGRICULTURE. By using this kernel you can expect to get good score and also learn keras. ic is angle of incidence for center of the image3. For example for a particular angle of incidence it varies like WATER. WTF is HH HV Ok so this Sentinal Settalite is equivalent to RISTSAT an Indian remote sensing Sat and they only Transmit pings in H polarization AND NOT IN V polarization. I don t have the data for scatter from ship but being a metal object it should vary differently as compared to ice object. Generate the training data Create 3 bands having HH HV and avg of both Take a look at a iceberg Import Keras. It would be helpful if we can create composite images using the backscatter from radar. From here the structural differences arise and we can exploit those differences using a CNN. Sending pulses of signals at a particular angle of incidence and then recoding it back. 2. The test dataset contain 8000 images We can exploit this. read_csv Input data files are available in the. Since Sentinel has only H transmitter return signals are of the form of HH and HV only. Those H pings gets scattered objects change their polarization and returns as a mix of H and V. Remember in radar data the shape of the iceberg is going to be like a mountain as shown in here. Get back to building a CNN using Keras. 019As you can see the HH component varies a lot but HV doesn t. Intro about the Data. Since this is not a actual image but scatter from radar the shape is going to have peaks and distortions like these. SETTLEMENTS. That s a ship looks like a elongated point. It makes building deep neural networks very easy. Now coming to the features of \u03c3o Basically \u03c3o varies with the surface on which the signal is scattered from. The data we have been given is backscatter coefficient which is the conventional form of backscatter coefficient given by \u03c3o dB \u03b2o dB 10log10 sin ip sin ic where1. You can t be on top 10 using this kernel so here is one beautiful peice of information. define our model Building the model Conv Layer 1 Conv Layer 2 Conv Layer 3 Conv Layer 4 Flatten the data for upcoming dense layers Dense Layers Dense Layer 2 Sigmoid Layer Without denoising core features. There are few papers on ship iceberg classification like this http elib. We can do pseudo labelling to increase the predictions. ConclusionTo increase the score I have tried Speckle filtering Indicence angle normalization and other preprocessing and they don t seems to work. ip is angle of incidence for a particular pixel2.
