Processing the data for training. I ll also prepare the output for submission with the appropiate mask encoding. We should be able to train an image classification model to identify each cell within the image. TRAINING MODEL SETUP Reference HPA Multi Label Classification with TF and W B https www. com wptouxx hpa single cell classification eda Segmentation using HPA Cell Segmentation https github. blend rgby images into single array Create PIL Image Input image arrays Output normalized image arrays Introduce list of image filters as. We ll put aside the yellow filter for now. Don t hessitate in asking anything Input list of image filters as png Output list of image filters as np. It s an ugly plot but I m trying to save some time here. Can use the function above. The continuation of the project is implemented in my notebook Test classification and submission https www. com ayuraj hpa multi label classification with tf and w b Imports. png to arrays Image normalization Process the arrays to obtain tensor of desired shapes and size Process the labels to obtain a tensor of the shapes required by the CNN model Function for plotting the history of the CNN training Let s check out the label distribution frequency. Now that the segmentation is complete. com CellProfiling HPA Cell Segmentation Visualizing the masks Let s check the results of the segmentation Cell separation The objective of this project is to label each cell in the image. The main problem is that the labels are given for each image therefore we don t really know which of the cells in the image may represent such label. arrays Get single image that blends all RGBY into RGB Introduce the images as arrays. png Returns a processed image ready for the CNN and an encoded label as tensor Transformation from. This will accelerate the processParameter setting Training data Validation data CNN Model Now it s time to save the model for later use. First I want to create a separate file with the stacked filters of every image. Therefor we can only pass a 3 filter image. Therefore each cell in the image must be separated. com christopherworley human protein atlas segmentation Functions Data Analisys. Nuclei segmentation Cell segmentation Nuclei mask Cell masks Plotting Let s stack the original image and the segmentation mask to see how the segmentation worked out Unique vector of cell_mask numbers We ll use EfficientNetB0 model which requires an image dimension of 224 224 3. Maybe the CNN is able to understand the pattern given the same label for every cell of the image although it can lead to high misslabeling.
