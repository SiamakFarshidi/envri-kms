If you like my kernel Please Vote If You like this kernel Here a similar one with Seq2Seq model https www. io posts 2015 08 Understanding LSTMs Post about building Time Series deep learning The post cover the Keras TensorFlow framework but it also gives a great overview of the main concepts and how to prepare the data. org learn tensorflow sequences time series and prediction home welcome LSTM networks Great post Blog that explains the concept beyond LSTM networks Link https colah. htmlWe also split the data to train and testing or validation sets. JPG The following parameters are provided to the net Num classes is the number of output in this case 1 Input size we don t use batch so we have one input of 28 samples Hidden layers number of hidden layer in each cell the more is better but also will slow down the training Num layers we have one layer of LSTM layer we will increase it Predict on Entire Data Set Test RMSE Multiple LSTM layers We can Enhance the net by using multiple LSTM layers. Normalizes our data using the min max scaler with minimum and maximum values of 1 and 1 respectivelyIf we print some of the examples we can see that the values are now between 1 and 1 Plot The distribution Plot the distribution before and after the Normalization. There are multiple methods to do this hold one off Cross Validation but for Time Series this needs careful and gentile planning. JPG Note that Pytorch has the nn. As you can see we kept the distribution of the data but we change its scales. Rolling windows For rolling windows we will use mean and std standard deviation The lags and rolling windows created Nan values When I tried to train with Nan values the loss was also Nan Need further understanding but for now I will replace the Nan by zero NormalizeDue to the multi dimension we need to adjust We can normalize the full Data Frame. LSTM function and nn. JPG attachment LSTMnet2. It is a basic course that provides a preliminary overview of the concept And building models to Univariate Time series. I hope that the next versions will go deeper and I can provide a full submission with deep learning. The Model has one LST layer and one dense input layer. Lag features Plot LagsLet s Plot our lags it is a bit hard to see the small lags as the Time Series containing few years but for the longer lags such as 365 we can see the shift. Lets see the shape of our data Pytorch Tensors Pytorch use tensors as the input to the model Variable is a wrapper to the tensor This kernel is only a preliminary starter So I use the Variable wrapperA more common way is to train with batches and use the dataset classBut this is for later. JPG attachment daysweek. It is the layer that will automatically create multiple LSTM layer and it seems that it uses more efficiently the Cuda drivers you can see more in this discussion https discuss. JPG Features can be lags or rolling windows. For this example I will use a window or a sequence of 28 samples 28 days So the data should look like this series. JPG To use the day of the week we will merge data from the calendar DF Let s Compare one example again to verify that the normalization was done properly Multi Dimensional Sliding WindowCreate the sliding window data set Pytorch Tensor LSTM model The model is similar to the previous one with some enhancement at the output layers Training Some enhancement we save the best model based on the lowest validation loss Predict RMSE Test What Next Add more features Calculate WRMSE Change Loss function Train MultiVarient series Use batches Add Convolotional Network Use Cross Validiation Create Submission If you like the kernel please vote and this will encourage me to post more Also I am happy to get comments or things that I need to fix. Version 4 7 Add Model with Multiple features Version 8 Add more epochs to the Multiple features model CreditsThe Basic data loading and the reduce memory function were taken from this great kernel https www. To go deeper and learn the topic I have decided to build a learning kernel that at least at the beginning will explain the topic and the concepts the definition and the basics From my experience when you try to explain to others you learn the most. JPG The Basic idea of Time Series prediction and RNN Recurrent Neural Network is to re arrange the data into windows of sequences and labels. Moving forwards I have decided to learn a bit more about the use of deep learning for Time Series prediction. com how to develop lstm models for time series forecasting Pytorch Basic example This is a simple example of how to build a Pytorch LSTM network for simple Univariate Time Series. Create Sequances In this part we allign the data into input features and labels with techniches whic adapt for Time series processing This is out Time Series TS2. You can read all the details about the LSTM Versus RNN at the link I provided above The picture of one cell is taken from that blog. JPG Or in a more schematic ilustriation TS1. JPG Now we can start again with the selected Time Series Add some features and modify a bit our model and training. JPG attachment LSTMnet1. For machine learning every dataset does not require normalization. png attachment image. Link https github. I do have a background from other competition with deep learning but for image vision working mostly with Pytorch. JPG Test RMSE Add Features So far we add only one feature The Sales demand Now let s add more features Features. It is easier to implement using data frame Lag is just shifting the sales demand. png Load Libraries GPU use Since this is a deep learning model The use of GPU will accelerate the training. So the first kernel is only trying to explain the basic idea using an arbitrary series from the M5 data. The first models are not so demanding so you can still use CPU training but it will be slower. However we need to do dummy normalize to our target the sales as our prediction will be 1D Day Of the Week This article https medium. JPG attachment Features. Load Data Date ListHere we create dates list that will help later on to display the Time Series with the right dates Select One Time Series as an Example Selecting one arbitrary Time Series Plot The TS SEED all Normlize Data Normalization is a technique often applied as part of data preparation for machine learning. It is required only when features have different rangesor scales. For simplicity at this stage We will split the data for the training set and a test setSo we got 1262 sets of 28 samples each as the features X and 1262 labels as our target y in the training set 622 sets of 28 samples with 622 labels in our tests set You can see that in Pytorch the tensor dimensions are opposite to the NumPy dimensions Simple LSTM model In this section we create the Pytorch LSTM model.

From what I have read you should use the nn. There are great kernel here mostly using the boosting models the most popular is LightGBM And I have learned how to prepare the data and use it with this popular model. com gopidurgaprasad m5 forecasting eda lstm pytorch modeling notebook scriptVersionId 31373530 Table Of Contents Main Steps 1 Load Data 2 One Time Series 3 Normlize Data 4 Create Sequances 5 Simple LSTM model 6 Multiple LSTM layers 7 Add Features 8 Resources Here are some useful resources that provide some background about deep learning Time series and various Reuicurent Networks Coursera has a course about Sequences Time series prediction. com davidheffernan_99410 an introduction to using categorical embeddings ee686ed7e7f9I have decided to try it as is on the day of the week So I will add four vectors which describe the days of the week daysweek. The goal of normalization is to change the values of numeric columns in the dataset to use a common scale without distorting differences in the ranges of values.
