Keras Limitations 10 02 2018 The validation_split is not supported in fit_generator hence its expects ImageDataGenerator for pre splitted train valid. h5 weights is useful for pure prediction of test image and this prediction will rely completely on ResNet50 pre trained weights i. Actually it is quite clean and easy to use Keras ImageDataGenerator except few limitations listed at the end. Even test images had to rearranged due to a known issue in flow_from_directory. It records training metrics training accuracy training loss validation loss validation accuracy for each epoch. Distributed ML for Grid Search on Spark Cluster References1. generates batches of tensor image data with real time data augmentation. Keras ImageDataGenerator flow_from_directory takes in classes list for mapping it to LABEL indices otherwise treats sub folders enumerated classes in alphabetical order i. Observe that training uses early stopping hence metrics is available for epochs run not for NUM_EPOCHS. com dansbecker transfer learning. Global Constants ResNet50 Notice that resnet50 folder has 2 pre trained weights files. predict_generator. Compile Our Transfer Learning Model Prepare Keras Data GeneratorsKeras ImageDataGenerator. Transfer Learning by Dan B https www. Train Our Model With Cats Dogs Train splitted Data Set Training MetricsOne of the default callbacks that is registered when training all deep learning models is the History callback. Tutorial Keras Transfer Learning with ResNet50 for image classification on Cats Dogs dataset Suni KumarThis kernel is intended to be a tutorial on Keras around image files handling for Transfer Learning using pre trained weights from ResNet50 convnet. 9GB of memory the plan was to batch source image data during the training validation testing pipeline. h5 xyz_tf_kernels_NOTOP. It is useful with large dataset to source pre process resize color conversion image augmentation batch normalize supply resulting images in batches to downstream Keras modeling components namely fit_generator. it does not expected any training from our side Out intention in this kernel is Transfer Learning by using ResNet50 pre trained weights except its TOP layer i. But note that to avoid ImageDataGenerator iterator repeatability we need to use 1 as batch_size. Cat is 0 Dog is 1. Observe Prediction Time With Different Batch SizeWith GPU 97s for full prediction with batch_size 100 vs 264s with 1. Though loading all train test images resized 224 x 224 x 3 in memory would have incurred 4. 5k for validation and re arranged into the desired folder hierarchy. Kaggle competition rule expects Dog Cat to be labeled as 1 0. 10 02 2018 Model learning through fit_generator is not compatible for Sklearn GridSearchCV again mostly due to no support for validation_split. Use this weights as initial weight for training new layer using train images Define Our Transfer Learning Network Model Consisting of 2 LayersHere we are preparing specification or blueprint of the TensorFlow DAG directed acyclcic graph for just the MODEL part. the xyz_tf_kernels_NOTOP. Note that training accuracy loss during epoch steps are somewhat incomplete information and they are not recorded in history. h5 The xyz_tf_kernels. Keras ImageDataGenerator expects labeled training images to be available in certain folder heirarchy train data was manually split into 10k for training 2. The data will be looped over in batches. Keras ImageDataGenerator supports batch sourcing image data for all training validation and testing.
