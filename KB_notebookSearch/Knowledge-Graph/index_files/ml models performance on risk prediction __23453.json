Example of Tuningk NN Accuracies for different values of n neaghbors Tuning Linear and Radial SVCNormally the best set of parameters are found by a process called grid search. oldpeak ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest 11. Reserve a portion of training set as the validation set. Make pairwise distribution plots and examine their correlations Statistical Tests We can perform some statistical tests to confirm our hypotheses. it Artificial Intelligence 40 11 61. Let s say we divide the dataset into k 10 parts. 05 mV Value 2 showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes criteria Data PreprocessingRaw data files must often but review and then cleaned to be effectively used for analysis and machine learning purposes. University Hospital Basel Switzerland Matthias Pfisterer M. colsample_bytree The ratio of features used in each iteration. Ensemble Generation Combine the now tuned models into one model in hopes of boosting the accuracy of the predictions1. Standardization or normalization is a useful technique to transform attributes with a Gaussian distribution differing means and standard deviations to a standard Gaussian distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Thus the instances of each class label or outcome in the train or test datasets is random. Gradually lower eta until we reach the optimum. StackingIt s much like cross validation. ReviewA quick outline of what was done in this notebook 1. If set to too high a number might run the risk of overfitting. You have to keep the predictions on the testing data as well. Model Engineering Compare the accuracy of models and tune only the most accurate ones1. fbs fasting blood sugar 120 mg dl 1. Encoding categorical variables if necessary. Just as some features were selected based on their importance or correlation selecting a subgroup of base models will inform a better performing ensemble model. thal thalium heart scan 1. Extra Trees Classifier 1. Value 2 atypical angina 1. Note that we will always encounter non i. In an effort to refine the search for a useful and accurate method with this dataset the results of serveral algorithms will be compared.

Data and Environment Setup Import data processing and analysis toolsThis Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed It is defined by the kaggle python docker image https github. Candidates for selectionGuassian Naive Bayes GNB Multilayer Perceptron and Logistic Regression are the top three performers. In particular the Cleveland Clinic Foundation cleveland. In many competitions public LB scores are not very consistent with local CV scores due to noise or non i. Approximately a 77 correct classification accuracy with a logistic regression derived discriminant function1. Ensemble methods usually produces more accurate solutions than a single model would. 6 fixed defect cold spots during rest and exercise 1.

Feature Selection 1. Value 0 normal 1. The pred_attribute field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. High variance has to be standardised. The diagonal shows the distribution of the the dataset with the kernel density plots. They would be 1. Define training and test samples The Cleveland data set available from the UCI repository has 303 samples the training and test data sets were randomly selected with 30 of the original data set corresponding to the test data set. max_depth The maximum depth of each tree. This is good from a point of view of feeding these features into the learning model because this means that there isn t much redundant or superfluous data in our training set. No features can be selected from this plot. A Weighted Voting Classifier will be used to stack the top three base models Guassian Naive Bayes Multilayer Perceptron and Logistic Regression. Data Exploration Discuss the heart data to be used and inspect it visually1. After the stacker is fitted use the predictions on testing data by base models each base model is trained 5 times therefore we have to take an average to obtain a matrix of the same shape as the input for the stacker and obtain our final predictions. That is the ultimate goal accomplished by this notebook. Recently such ML models were also used to detect with cardiologist level accuracy 14 types of arrhythmias sometime life threatening heart beats form ECG electrocardiogram signals generated by wearable monitors. 9 accuracy on the Cleveland database. It tells us whether our model is at high risk of overfitting. The models used to create such ensemble models are called base models. k Fold Cross ValidationCross validation is an essential step in model training. Imputation Check for invalid tuples in dataset Any NaN or invalid entries will have to be addressed via imputation or feature removal StandardizationThere can be a lot of deviation in the given dataset. Grid search iterates through all the possible combinations to find the best set of parameters. So the classifier with single accuracy will be assigned the highest weight and so on. The end goal is to produce an approved machine learning application in healthcare to be approved it had to pass tests to show it can produce results at least as accurately as humans are currently able to. Hungarian 77 74 Long beach 79 77 Swiss 81 81 1. Sometimes we can get enough intuition from visualization but quantitative results are always good to have. StratificationWhen we split the dataset into train and test datasets the split is completely random. The relative proportions of the classes of interest disease no disease in both sets were checked to be similar. Use box plot and scatter plot to inspect their distributions and check for outliers1. Aha Dennis Kibler 1. Otherwise we would have too few samples in each fold to guarantee statistical significance. Thus we should train and test our algorithm on each and every instance of the dataset. Improve a model s performance by tuning its parameters. This analysis will include visualization of the data and statistical examinations. Value 3 non anginal pain 1. Methods There are hundreds of machine learning models but often only a few yeild high accuracy results for a given dataset. Ensemble Learning refers to the technique of combining different models. Some features are linearly related to others. Correlation matrix selecting only the uncorrelated features. This is to combat overfitting too. Yet we ensemble them anyway because it usually increase the overall performance. Next we will do 5 iterations. If we use more folds the CV score would become more reliable but the training takes longer to finish as well. This is why we tend to include non tree based models in the ensemble even though they don t perform as well. Value 2 showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes criteria8.

Understand the problem look at each variable and do a philosophical analysis about their meaning and importance for this problem. In many competitions public LB scores are not very reliable. slope the slope of the peak exercise ST segment 1. Plot the data with points colored according to their classification tasks this helps with feature engineering1. This is to combat overfitting. gamma minimum loss reduction required to make a further partition on a leaf node of the tree. Ensemble methods are techniques that create multiple models and then combine them to produce improved results. After 5 iterations we will obtain a matrix of shape samples in training data X base models. Voting EnsembleVoting is one of the simplest ways of combining the predictions from multiple machine learning algorithms. Robinson Computing Science Department Sam Houston State University nsr004 shsu. This matrix is then fed to the stacker it s just another model in the second level. Even modest improvements in prognostic models of heart events and complications could save hundreds of lives and help to significantly reduce the cost of health care services medications and lost productivity. Value 1 having ST T wave abnormality T wave inversions and or ST elevation or depression of 0. So we have to be careful about which test to use and how we interpret the findings. that any publications resulting from the use of the data include the names of the principal investigator responsible for the data collection at each institution. A lot of features can affect the accuracy of the algorithm. Univariable study focus on the dependent variable SalePrice and try to know a little bit more about it. edu August 5th 2018Table of Contents Introduction MotivationThe American Heart Association Statistics 2016 Report indicates that heart disease is the leading cause of death for both men and women responsible for 1 in every 4 deaths. Conclusion Where we are now discussing the resultsAll of these steps contributibute to a more useful accurate model with a final accuracy of 89. Almost all of the decision based models over fit on the train. The front runnners will be analyzed and used to develop a unique higher accuracy method. Use the validation set as watch_list to re train the model with the best parameters. early_stopping_rounds If we don t see an increase of validation score for a given number of iterations the algorithm will stop early. Results The CLASSIT conceptual clustering system achieved a 78. Address Robert Detrano M. This might put a strain on the model. So during classification we may have accurate predictions for class1 but not for class2. Langley P Fisher D. input directory 13 dataset features Load data dataset. It reduces training time and reduces overfitting 1. Ensemble EngineeringCreating ensemble models from base models is a common way to boost accuracy. Dealing with outliers. Unlike random forest gradient boosting would eventually overfit if we do not limit its depth. Extra Trees Classification Random Forest Classification Selected Features Preprocessing Data must be stardardized stratified and imputated again before the ML models can be compared. It reduces both bias and variance of the final model thus increasing the score and reducing the risk of overfitting. Conclusion When given a raw set of data to work with there are many ways in which to refine it analyze it and make use of it. The accuracies and errors are then averaged to get a average accuracy of the algorithm. Base models should be as unrelated as possibly. num_round Total number of iterations. Classifiers will be assigned weight according to their accuracies. This is like max_features in RandomForestClassifier. An algorithm may underfit over a dataset for some training data and sometimes also overfit the data for other training set. Usually 5 fold CV is good enough. Observe how score changes on validation set in each iteration. Medical Center Long Beach and Cleveland Clinic Foundation Robert Detrano M. 3 normal no cold spots 1. We continue the process by changing the testing part in each iteration and training the algorithm over the other parts. We reserve 1 part for testing and train the algorithm over the other 9 parts. For example the most important parameters for a random forest is the number of trees in the forest and the maximum number of features used in developing each tree. Basic cleaning clean the dataset and handle the missing data outliers and categorical variables 1. it American Journal of Cardiology it 64 304 310. 5 probability threshold Data Name CDF CADENZA 1. means to select only the important features in order to improve the accuracy of the algorithm. Test assumptions check if our data meets the assumptions required by most multivariate techniques. 7th Street Long Beach CA 90028 1. Dealing with missing data. Thus we may have many instances of class 1 in training data and less instances of class 2 in the training data. Take 5 fold stacking as an example. In each iteration train every base model on 4 folds and predict on the hold out fold. Establish the relative performance of deep learning models such as deep belief networks and convolutional neural networks and ensembles with respect to classical machine learning algorithms including logistic regression using cases studies built from well known heart disease data sets such as the Cleveland set available from the UCI repository Research questions of interest are For what would be the threshold of sample size in heart disease studies where the more complex but potentially more effective deep learning models would be recommended Would ensembles of machine learning models be able to provide more robust predictions as it has been the case in other knowledge domains Does the ACC AHA list of eight risk factors should be updated with other genetic or lifestyle factors The deep learning models will be implemented in Tensorflow originally from Google now open source and healthcare. By picking up the most important features we can use interactions between them as new features. A Voting Classifier can then be used to wrap your models and average the predictions of the sub models when asked to make predictions for new data. Thus we stratify the data so that we have proportionate data for all the classes in both the training and testing data. Ideally we would want CV scores obtained by different approaches to improve in sync with each other and with the LB score but this is not always possible. It works by first creating two or more standalone models from your training dataset. Models of incremental concept formation. Inspect the distribution of the target variable an imbalanced distribution of target variable might harm the performance of some models 1. ca number of major vessels 0 3 colored by flourosopy 13. chol serum cholestoral in mg dl 6. Value 1 upsloping 1. Value 3 downsloping 12. Thus with cross validation we can achieve a generalised model. it International application of a new probability algorithm for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. Sometimes this gives surprising improvement. However we shouldn t use too many folds if our training data is limited. e there may be a high number of class1 instances but less number of other class instances. The math says that the greater the diversity and less bias in the final ensemble. Multivariate study understand how the dependent variable and independent variables relate. This way in each iteration every base model will make predictions on 1 fold of the training data and all of the testing data. Experiments with the Cleveland database have concentrated on simply attempting to distinguish presence values 1 2 3 4 from absence value 0. subsample The ratio of training data used in each iteration. We can choose important features in 3 ways 1. Trade off In practice we may end up with highly related models of comparable performances. Value 2 flat 1. Looking at the scatter plots we can say that no two attributes are able to clearly seperate the two outcome class instances. A model usually have many parameters but only a few of them are significant to its performance. Relevant Information1. Many times the data is imbalanced i. 1 num_round to 300 500. 7 reversible defect when cold spots only appear during exercise 14. I have demonstrated nearly all the key steps to take a dataset and turn it into a tool to potentially make the world a better place. cp chest pain type 1. Error from imputationGet mean absolute error score from imputation with extra columns showing what was imputed Accuracy of training and test sets Confusion matrices of training and test sets Predict class labels for the training set 0 Healthy 1 Sick Predict class labels for the test set 0 Healthy 1 Sick Accuracy of models with all featuresNow without feauture engineering and lets check how models perform on test and train data Feature Engineering1. Complete attribute documentation1. The scatter plots shows the relation between each and every attribute or features taken pairwise. Lower eta means slower training but better convergence. Budapest Andras Janosi M. Medical Center 5901 E. Using the overlapping features from the two tests above the new set of features will only include _cp thalach oldpeak ca thal exang_ Imputation Standardization Stratification Error from imputation Accuracy of models with selected features Model Engineering Model SelectionSelecting accurate models tuning them and training them is essential to robust results. This database contains 76 attributes but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. It is widely believed that we should trust our CV scores under such situation. Parameter TuningSelecting best possible parameters for our top three Guassian Naive Bayes GNB Multilayer Perceptron MP and Logistic Regression LR. Performance of base models shouldn t differ to much. First we split the training data into 5 folds. Less features mean faster training1. Instance based prediction of heart disease presence with the Cleveland database 1. In theory for the ensemble to perform well two factors matter 1. exang exercise induced angina 1. You can use test results to roughly set a threshold for determining whether an increase of score is due to genuine improvment or randomness. Using machine learning to understand predict and prevent cardiovascular disease Nathan S. values evaluate the model by splitting into train and test sets predict class labels for the train set predict class labels for the test set check the mean absolute error on test set instantiate a logistic regression model and fit with X and y with training data in X y check the accuracy on the training set check the accuracy on the test set max_features 13 0. 5 Dataset of selected features Testing and comparing various classifications for Accuracy ROC Area under Curve Gmean Precision Recall k 10 split the data into 10 equal parts iterate over classifiers Set the parameters by cross validation gnb_gscv GridSearchCV gnb param_grid cv kfold scoring accuracy n_jobs 1 verbose 1 hidden_layer_sizes x for x in itertools. Data Preprocessing Clean up the messy parts of the dataset and prepare it to be used by the ML models1. Use grid search to find the best combination of other parameters. Value 0 50 diameter narrowing 1. Value 1 typical angina 1. Often when we improve the model and get a better local CV score the LB score becomes worse. We will use these and a couple other base models to create a stacked ensemble. Then we can take an average of all the noted accuracies over the dataset. Hungarian Institute of Cardiology. The loss of precision during floating point arithemics can bring noise into the data two seemingly different values might be the same before conversion. The larger the more conservative the algorithm will be. Set eta to a relatively high value e. University Hospital Zurich Switzerland William Steinbrunn M. trestbps resting blood pressure in mm Hg on admission to the hospital 5. pred_attribute the predicted attribute diagnosis of heart disease angiographic disease status 1. Results in percent accuracy for 0. International Probability Analysis 1. We need to understand how models work and what impact each parameter has to the model s performance whether it s accuracy robustness or speed. Introduction Premise for this work and import literally hundreds of machine learning algorithms analysis tools and evironment tools1. ai an open source that facilitate the development of machine learning in healthcare with the prevision that can handle so called big data by using the Hadoop Spark platform. Tuning Guassian Naive Bayes GNB has no hyperparameters for the Cross Validation Grid Search to test. eta Step size used in updating weights in each boosting step to prevent overfitting. Feature Engineering Compare importance of features and make a new dataset with only the most impotant ones1. For example floats derived from raw figures may be truncated. EDA should provide some insights for subsequent processing and modeling. data database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to this date. Instead GNB benefits largely from the data preprocessing and feature selection that was performed earlier Tuning Multilayer Perceptron Tuning Logistic Regression Tuning XGBoost These XGBoost parameters are generally considered to have real impacts on its performance 1. restecg resting electrocardiographic results 1.
