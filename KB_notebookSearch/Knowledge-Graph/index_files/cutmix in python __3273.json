In this augmentation technique patches are cut and pasted among training images where interestingly the ground truth labels are also mixed proportionally to the area of the patches. We will further one hot encode https scikit learn. Generating Random Bounding BoxHere is a function to generate a random bounding box in an image Now let s test the function by generating a random bounding box and crop an image using that bounding box. References https arxiv. The paper also shows that CutMix improves the model robustness against input corruptions and its out of distribution detection performances. By making efficient use of training pixels and retaining the regularization effect of regional dropout CutMix consistently outperformed the state of the art augmentation strategies on CIFAR and ImageNet classification tasks as well as on the ImageNet weakly supervised localization task. html these labels to 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1. Now you can use CutMix augmentation in training you deep neural network model. For more details please follow the references. org stable modules generated sklearn. com ZenFeather cutmix augmentation in python bf099a97afac The paper CutMix Regularization Strategy to Train Strong Classifiers with Localizable Features published in ICCV 2019 proposed the CutMix augmentation strategy to improve deep learning based classification and localization tasks. Please follow this https stanford. These images are takes from Kaggle s Glbal Wheat Detection competition dataset. Let s assume that this batch is a minibacth generated by a dataloader that loads minibatches during the training of the deep neural network model. png attachment image. The label of each resultant augmented image is estimated as a weighted sum of the original label and the label of the image from which the modified patch is borrowed where weights are lambda and 1 lambda respectively. edu shervine blog pytorch how to generate data parallel to learn more about dataloaders in PyTorch. org wiki Beta_distribution. In general the bacth loaded by a dataloader also includes a batch of image labels if we are solving a classification problem. If you have any questions please put them in the comment section. A CutMix Image GenerationIn CutMix algorithm for each image of batch a random region in our case a random bounding box region is replaced with a patch from another training image. Improving Classification and Object Detection using CutMix Augmentation Supplementary to my medium article https medium. Loading DataTo show the result of CutMix augmentation we will use a set of images containing images of wheat field showing wheat heads. Generating a Batch of DataNow we will create a set or batch of 4 images. We will randomly assign a label to each image from from the set of 0 1 2. The parameter lambda that determines the size of the bounding box is stochastically sampled from a Beta distribution https en. In the following table we can see the performance boost obtained by adopting CutMix augmentation.
