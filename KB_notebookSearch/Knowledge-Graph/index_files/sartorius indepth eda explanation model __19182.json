The loss of neurons spreads in a somewhat predictable pattern to other regions of the brains. Some brain tumors are noncancerous benign and some brain tumors are cancerous malignant.

The IoU of a proposed set of object pixels and a set of true object pixels is calculated as IoU A B A B A B The competition uses a couple of medical terms which many people will be unfamiliar with. Researchers trying to understand the cause of Alzheimer s disease are focused on the role of two proteins Plaques Beta amyloid is a fragment of a larger protein. Load Datasets load datasets 8. Primary brain tumors begin when normal cells develop changes mutations in their DNA. Tangles Tau proteins play a part in a neuron s internal support and transport system to carry nutrients and other essential materials. The data between bands is really correlated typical with visible imagery and why most satellite image analysts prefer to at least have near infrared values. Image Initialize W B The config variable is to show that you can pass in any dict hyperparameters Empty mask Fill mask Log to W B Close W B run. More specifically you ll use phase contrast microscopy images to train and test your model for instance segmentation of neuronal cells. As a result new drugs could be discovered to treat the millions of people with these leading causes of death and disability. For any image specific classification clustering etc. A cell s DNA contains the instructions that tell a cell what to do. In adults primary brain tumors are much less common than are secondary brain tumors in which cancer begins elsewhere and spreads to the brain. At first a person with Alzheimer s disease may be aware of having difficulty remembering things and organizing thoughts. Global ConfigLoad Datasets Understanding the Structure of the Dataset Goal of Competition In this competition we are segmenting neuronal cells in images. transforms we ll want to collapse spatial dimensions so that we have a matrix of pixels by color channels. LIVECell is the predecessor dataset to this competition.

To easen out the process I am providing the foundations of the mentioned diseases and proposed treatments to give a stronger domain understanding.

Scatter plots are a go to to look for clusters and separatbility in the data but these are busy and don t reveal density well so we switch to using 2d histograms instead.

Distribution Plots distribution plots 10. Neurons are damaged lose connections to each other and eventually die. The damage most often starts in the region of the brain that controls memory but the process begins years before the first symptoms. The hidden test set is roughly 240 images.

In this notebook I will use Weights and Biases s amazing features to perform wonderful visualizations and logging seamlessly. Brain changes associated with Alzheimer s disease lead to growing trouble with Memory Thinking and Reasoning Making Judgements and Decisions Planning and Performing Familiar Tasks Changes in Personality and Behaviour Preserved Skills What are the Causes At a basic level brain proteins fail to function normally which disrupts the work of brain cells neurons and triggers a series of toxic events. The mutations tell the cells to grow and divide rapidly and to continue living when healthy cells would die. These clusters form larger deposits called amyloid plaques which also include other cellular debris. Alzheimer s Disease alzheimers disease 3. In Alzheimer s disease tau proteins change shape and organize themselves into structures called neurofibrillary tangles.

Alzheimer s disease is the most common cause of dementia a continuous decline in thinking behavioral and social skills that affects a person s ability to function independently. Only a few test set images are available for download the remainder can only be accessed by your notebooks when you submit. You will find extra data for the SH SHY5Y cell line plus several other cell lines not covered in the competition dataset that may be of interest for transfer learning. Evaluation Metric This competition is evaluated on the mean average precision at different intersection over union thresholds. A family member or friend may be more likely to notice how the symptoms worsen. The number of images is small but the number of annotated objects is quite high.

Brain tumors can begin in your brain primary brain tumors or cancer can begin in other parts of your body and spread to your brain as secondary metastatic brain tumors What are the Key Symptoms General signs and symptoms caused by brain tumors may include New onset or change in pattern of headaches Headaches that gradually become more frequent and more severe Unexplained nausea or vomiting Vision problems such as blurred vision double vision or loss of peripheral vision Gradual loss of sensation or movement in an arm or a leg Difficulty with balance Speech difficulties Feeling very tired Confusion in everyday matters Difficulty making decisions Inability to follow simple commands Personality or behavior changes Seizures especially in someone who doesn t have a history of seizures Hearing problems What are the Causes Primary brain tumors originate in the brain itself or in tissues close to it such as in the brain covering membranes meninges cranial nerves pituitary gland or pineal gland.
