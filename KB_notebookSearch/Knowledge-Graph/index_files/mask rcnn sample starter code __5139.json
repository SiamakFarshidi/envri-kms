Try finetuning some variables to custom values Now it s time to train the model. Simplifies image annotation in order to widen the participation in the futrue of medical image deep learning. See the following example notebook for parsing annotations and training using MD. Classification of chest vs. This is based on our deep learning for medical imaging lessons Lesson 1. ai documentation URL https docs. Note that training even a basic model can take a few hours. Note the following model is for demonstration purpose only. predictions on the validation dataset verbose 1 Get filenames of test dataset DICOM images Make predictions on test images write out sample submission assume square image If grayscale. format x1 y1 width height predict only the first 50 entries cat submission. 06870 for object detection and instance segmentation. background 1 pneumonia classes Add classes add images If grayscale. validation dataset split ratio is set to 0. Note that the Mask RCNN detector configuration parameters have been selected to reduce training time for demonstration purposes they are not optimal. remove files to allow committing hit files limit otherwise. ai annotator project LxR6zdR2 workspace Annotator features The annotator can be used to view DICOM images and create image and exam level annotations. Mask RCNN Sample Starter Model for the RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge MD.

Note that we trained only one epoch for demonstration purposes ONLY. Final steps Create the submission file Directory to save logs and trained model python setup. Image augmentation Train Mask RCNN Model select trained model Pick last directory Find the last checkpoint Recreate the model in inference mode Load trained weights fill in path to trained weights here set color for class Show few example of ground truth vs. ai python client library implements functions to easily download images and annotations and to prepare the datasets used to train the model for classification. We have limited the training to one epoch and have set nominal values for the Detector Configuration to reduce run time. ai annotator to view DICOM images and create annotatios to be exported. ai Install Matterport s Mask RCNN model from github. The data wrangling is abstracted away by the interface and by our MD. The annotator allows you to create initial annotations build and run models modify finetune the annotations based on predicted values and repeat. Let s look at a sample annotation. Display a random image with bounding boxes Image Augmentation. We can put multiple images on each GPU because the images are small. validation respectively prepare the training dataset Show annotation s for a DICOM image prepare the validation dataset Load and display random samples and their bounding boxes Suggestion Run this a few times to see different examples.

Batch size is 8 GPUs images GPU. We see a bounding box with x y of the the top left corner as well as the width and height. See the Matterport s implementation of Mask RCNN https github. Some setup functions and classes for Mask RCNN dicom_fps is a list of the dicom image path and filenames image_annotions is a dictionary of the annotations keyed by the filenames parsing the dataset returns a list of the image filenames and the annotations dictionary Examine the annotation data parse the dataset and view dicom fields Split the data into training and validation datasets Note We have only used only a portion of the images for demonstration purposes. com matterport Mask_RCNN. To use all the images do image_fps_list list image_fps Or change the number of images from 100 to a custom number Create and prepare the training dataset using the DetectorDataset class. csv show a few test image detection example original image assume square image If grayscale.
