Logistic regression measures the relationship between the categorical dependent variable feature and one or more independent variables features by estimating probabilities using a logistic function which is the cumulative logistic distribution. GaussianProcessClassifier approximates the non Gaussian posterior with a Gaussian based on the Laplace approximation. Binary classification is a special case where only a single regression tree is induced. In contrast to the regression setting the posterior of the latent function is not Gaussian even for a GP prior since a Gaussian likelihood is inappropriate for discrete class labels. org wiki Naive_Bayes_classifier.
