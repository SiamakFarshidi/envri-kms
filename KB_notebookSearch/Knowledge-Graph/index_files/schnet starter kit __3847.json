The core idea is same as Heng s which employ GNN as a feature exstractor. Next SchNet layer is applied for feature extraction. First fully connected layer is applied to input arrays to align dimensions. Model Build SchNet modelThe prediction model is implemented as follows. This helps us to analyze the result of training. Install packagesIn this example I use chainer chemistry which offer an implementation of SchNet. Other extensionsExponentialShift is set as a learning rate scheduler. You would achieve better score by continuing training procedure longer. Make updatorSince the model receives input arrays separately I implement an original converter. The prediction for test data is also calculated in this evaluator and the submision file is generated. Define Graph class Convert into graph objectEach dataset is represented as a list of Graphs and prediction targets. com pfnet research chainer chemistry Import packagesNext I import main packages. This library can be install by PIP. 08566 SchNet a deep learning architecture for molecules and materialshttps arxiv. Load datasetIn this example 90 of training data is used actual training data and the other 10 is used for validation. Two feature vectors are concatenated and thrown into regression header. The molecules which have same number of atoms are selected simultaneously. Train more Tune hyperparameters Add original feature Try different GNNs Blend with Gradient Boosting MachinesYou can start with this kernel and don t forget upvote References SchNet A continuous filter convolutional neural network for modeling quantum interactionshttps arxiv. I hope this kernel helps beginners of DNN and will be used as a starter kit. I add batch normalization layers like ResNet. Which graph CNN is the best with starter kit at LB 1. More details of his idea and discussions can be read in below pages. An extension which turn off training mode is also set to deactivate normalizatoin from second epoch. Training RunI tuned number of epochs to prevent timeout. Convert into chainer s datasetThis type of dataset can be handled by DictDataset. Make iterators oprimizerIterators for data feeding is made as below. input_array and dists are exstracted from Graph object and pair_index and targets are exstracted from targets object. Training extensions EvaluatorI implemented an Evaluator which measure validation score during training. IntroductionI share a simple example which employ SchNet for predicting coupling constants. Training preparation Make samplersFor mini batch training I implement a sampler named SameSizeSampler. Log options are set to report the metrics. Check output For more improvementThis example can be improved by below ways. train data validation data test data structures PreprocessingI implemented a class named Graph whose instances contain molecules. Graph objects and prediction targets are merged as a DictDataset. When this converter is used for evaluation targets is not added. Finally features vectors are concatenated and thrown into three layers MLP. SchNet tends to be underfitting longer training makes the model better basically. com c champs scalar coupling discussion 93972 latest 591759Due to the limitation of Kaggle kernel the model in not trained completely in this Kernel. Make optimizerAdam is used as an optimizer. targets is added only for training. Chainer Chemistry A Library for Deep Learning in Biology and Chemistryhttps github. Other sub modules are imported later. Each dataset is grouped by molecule_name name for following procedures.
