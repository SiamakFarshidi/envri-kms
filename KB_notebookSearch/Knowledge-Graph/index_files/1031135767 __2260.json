Is that the best possible test data accuracy A No the best data accuracy for test data is not the best one in train data is another setsub of thickness size adhesion nuclei nucleoli which has the accuracy of 0. 9723Part2 random forest classifier s subset for train data random forest s test subset Answer 1. Which subset looks best given the cross validation scores A The subset of thickness shape adhesion single nucleoli is the best in train data with a score of 0. 9647Part 3 This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed It is defined by the kaggle python docker image https github. read_csv Input data files are available in the. Author Michael ZhouID 1337316Pair Programming Buddy Name Lan NiuID 1320386Find the best subset given cross validation scores Find the accuracy of same five subset then find the best accuracy. 9647619047619047 3. They are different so the test result is not the best data accuracy. What is the accuracy of this subset on the test data A The accuracy of this subset on test data is 0. Is that the best possible test data accuracy A No the best data accuracy for test data is not the best one in train data is another setsub of thickness size single nuclei chromatin mitosis which has the accuracy of 0. Which subset looks best given the cross validation scores A The subset of thickness size shape adhesion nuclei chromatin nucleoli is the best in train data with a score of 0. For example running this by clicking run or pressing Shift Enter will list the files in the input directory Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output. Is that the best possible test data accuracy A No the best data accuracy for test data is not the best one in train data is another setsub of thickness shape single which has the accuracy of 0.
