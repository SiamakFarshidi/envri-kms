For the two class problem 1 1 each weak classifier will calculate a prediction result of 1 or 1. Comparison of real and predicted values Test data The most important feature deciding players salary is minutes per game. 6 nbsp nbsp Correlation between Points per game and age2. Using Standardized features RMSE decreases and R 2 imporves. When play time longer than 31 minuates which is standard for starting players the expectation of salary is 18 millions dollars. Correlation Plot Age and multiple data indicators are weakly correlated. Correlation between Points per game and ageFor point guards age and average scores are inverse U shaped. These prediction results are multiplied by the weighting coefficients of the respective weak classifiers and added. jpg Variable ExplainingVariable meaning Pos PositionMPG Average Minutes played Per GamePPG Average Points Per GameAPG Average Assists Per GameRPG Average Rebounds Per GameTOPG Average Turnovers Per GameBPG Average Blocks Per GameSPG Average Steals Per GamePER Player Efficiency RatingG Games AttendedAGE Agesalary17_18 2017 2018 Salary million Descriptive Statistics Data Visualization Average Points Per Game Ranking Player Efficiency Rating Ranking High Age Players Ranking hqdefault. Average turnover and steals have no effect on salary. 4 minuates the average salary is just 5. Of course each base classifier is multiplied by its own weight. jpg attachment hqdefault.

Variable Importance The results of the AdaBoost algorithm show that the average playing time and efficiency rate have the most important impact on salary while the average score is only ranked third. Which position is the most prone to turnovers Answer Point Guards Who has the most blocks no doubt PreprocessingMost variables are skew thus we should rescale them. For those who have more playing time next important features are PER and Age. 8 nbsp nbsp Who has the most blocks 3 nbsp nbsp Preprocessing3.
