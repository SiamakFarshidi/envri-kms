Another important aspect of the project is the feature creation process since the variety of features that could be created based on the underlying raw data is extremely high. In attempting to solve this problem I apply feature transformation and dimensionality reduction techniques so as to increase the quality of the feature space. I compare multiple classification algorithms and choose the one that performs best on a separate test dataset. When considering all possible features as model inputs over 800 dimensions could be considered. Alternatively one could consider the betting odds of a specific bookkeeper on the given match and utilize them to make a prediction of the outcome. The main challenge of this project is to overcome the high degree of randomness in football by finding patterns in a high dimensional dataset. First more data sources could be included in the analysis to further strengthen model performance e. Third the algorithm to translate probability predictions of the final model into a betting strategy could be significantly improved. ConclusionIn the following concluding remarks on the outcome of the project are presented. Second the model selection process could be further expanded to include more model types as well as feature selection algorithms however I am confident that no significant improvements in model performance are achievable in such a manor.

Combining the model selection and tuning process with cross validation the robustness and replicability of results is ensured. ReflectionIn summary the results of my project reflect a solid first effort in prediction match outcomes in football using machine learning techniques. Also I apply probability calibration methods based on isotonic regression to increase the quality of class probability estimates of my classifier. However I believe that given more data sources it is certainly possible to further increase the performance of the model. For instance the number of goals a team has scored in the last five matches could be a viable indicator of the outcome of their next match but also the overall FIFA rating of one of their players could be considered when making a prediction. Match Outcome Prediction Project IntroductionThe goal of this project is to predict match outcomes of European football matches more accurately than bookkeepers thereby beating the odds and to in the end generate a positive return on investment. It remains that football matches are affected by countless factors as well as a high degree of randomness which makes it impossible to achieve perfect prediction accuracy in my opinion. I hope my project can be a basis for more successful attempts to match outcome prediction and will ultimately result in a prediction based betting strategy that is robust in generating a positive return of investment. Since existing approaches to football predictions are considered I created a variety of features that resulted in final model performance superior to bookkeeper prediction accuracy. For instance one could experiment with varying the amount per bet based on a measure confidence that the model outperforms the bookkeeper. Based on the dataset provided on kaggle. ImprovementThere are several ways to improve the performance of the current implementation related to both feature creation and model training as well as the betting strategy algorithm. Also this is my second machine learning and my first python project. All in all I believe it is absolutely possible to develop a model that achieves accuracy far beyond the 53 that I achieved so far in my honest opinion it could be possible to predict as much as 65 to 70 percent of matches accurately. com that includes basic match data FIFA player statistics and bookkeeper data I built a model to predict the probability of each match outcome win draw or defeat. The optimal solution would be a classification algorithm with better performance than bookkeeper predictions and a betting strategy powered by said prediction algorithm that achieves positive returns on investment when betting on football matches. By comparing multiple classification algorithms in combination with two dimensionality reduction techniques it was discovered that a logistic regression model in combination with a principal component analysis has the best performance. I firmly believe that this model selection and tuning process can easily be applied to all sorts of classification problems. Creating these features choosing what aspects of a football match to take into account for prediction and ensuring that the set of features as a whole fully reflects the bandwidth of facets of a football match was certainly the most difficult part of this project. Lastly I simulate making bets using my prediction model on the test set and observe the resulting return on investment. Therefore please feel free to suggest improvements to the methodology as well as the code.
