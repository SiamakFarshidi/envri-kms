Machine Learning Classification Modeling Step 01. Normalize data Step 02. Only categoryid and available were given in the column property while the rest are hashed for confidentiality purpose. There is no general trend in the number of sales along category id. The first row in the dataframe above indicates that Visitor id 172 had viewed the item id 10034 four times before resolving to purchase. However when I checked the distribution of data the number of items with multiple categories was not many. Is there any relationship between View Time and Transaction choosen feature dayofweek hour previous view previous transaction 2. There was no clear relationship between category and transaction sales. 5 hours with 30 minutes as a median. 6 million but unique visitor for the views is the half which means that on average one visitor caused 2 actions. About 30 of transactions were made after a buyer view an item once or twice. When analysing the distribution of events View occupies 96. In summary 80 of total transactions were made after less than three times item view. Logistic Regression Algorithm. Is there any relationship between Item Category and Transaction Category ID is a subset or child of Parent Id. I ll check both timelines one is from the first item view to transaction and other is from the last item view to transaction. All transaction events have transaction ID. There are some outliers such as 844 views for buying a single item and hence I will check the distribution of view counts to have a better idea about general purchase cases. I will use only categoryid and hence leave only the rows with that. EDA Exploratory Data Analysis Except in transactionid there are no missing values. There is no general trend in the number of sales along parent id. This dataset is recorded from 3rd May 2015 to 18th September 2015 GMT. As dates in current dataset is in unix timestamp the number of seconds since 1970 01 01 I ll convert them into readable dates. How many times did a customer view an item before making purchase decision date_time transaction In the dataframe above multiple views are mixed in for one transaction which means there are cases that a visitor checked the item multiple times. On the other hand multiple view transactions showed more dispersed time range about 9 minutes to 9. K Nearest Neighbors Algorithm The best model is when k value is 7 with 92 of model accuracy. I had assumed that the more Category ID or Parent ID an item has the more transactions it might have as the item could have exposed in multiple category pages. However when multiple view buyers checked the product for the last time before purchase they took similar short amount of time to single view buyers. How many times does it take for one single transaction to be made In case of single view transactions they generally take around 3 to 11 minutes to reach the end of buying journey view to transaction. When analysing the item view numbers I found around 50 of transactions were made without more than once view a visitor checked an item added to cart and checked out. Decision Tree Algorithm Step 03 3. Train Test Split Step 03 1. The second row is about another item the same visitor purchased and this time the visitor viewed that item five times.
