Prostate cANcer graDe Assessment PANDA Challenge My First Submission Introduction Prostate Gland and Prostate CancerThe prostate is part of the male reproductive system. Checkpoints DirectoryThis creates a checkpoint directory for ResNet34 and copies the model to the directory. The test dataset will undergo the same image processing as the training dataset and is described in the next following steps. Submit the current notebook to the competition to access the testing data. This predicts the data from the train dataset and the validation dataset. The code will run in the background to evaluate the test dataset. The first step involves removing the gray area from around the biopsy Zenify. Remove gray area surrounding the biopsy. Predict the ISUP Grade with ResNet34 and fast. The second step is to take 16 samples that have the lowest portion of white. Prostate CANcer GraDe Assessment PANDA Challenge.
