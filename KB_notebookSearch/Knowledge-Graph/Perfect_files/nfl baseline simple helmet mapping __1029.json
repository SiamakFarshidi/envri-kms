The reason why I did not use vertical coordinates is because simplicity and the lateral direction is more accurate but we can get more accurate mapping if we use depth as well. calculate the overlaps between pred_box and gt_box Keep sub_labels for review this would be 0. get the coordinate of inters 2. Compare the NGS tracking data with the lateral coordinates of the boxes. com robikscube nfl helmet assignment getting started guide Read label from CSV Maximum of 22 boxes per frame. Map the players to have the smallest difference between each boxes and coordinates. com robikscube nfl helmet assignment getting started guide Estimated video frame copied from https www. copied from https www. setting and loading data adding Estimated video frame to trackingI used robikscube s great code here. So the angle at which the distance is the smallest is selected by grid search. Check for unique boxes 1. mapping helmet box and NGS tracking data validationI used robikscube s great code here. In this notebook I will show you how to map helmet bbox and NGS tracking data. Only one label allowed per frame. Since the camera and the XY axis will be rotated if it is out of the center of the court. The direction of the axis changes depending on the camera position so I choose the one that gives smaller distance for both directions. calculate the area of union print uni 4.
