I compare run times to a kernel training the same model on a CPU here https www. The dataThe dataset contains images with 29 different signs in American Sign Language. We re also adding new image processing datasets to our Datasets platform kaggle. IntroKaggle provides free access to NVidia K80 GPUs in kernels. Sample images below Data Processing Set Up Model Specification Model Fitting Imports for Deep Learning ensure consistency across runs Imports to view data add channel for RGB. If you want to use these GPU s for deep learning projects you ll likely find our Deep Learning Course kaggle. This kernel was run with a GPU. png ___Select the Settings tab. These are the 26 letters A through Z plus the signs for space delete and nothing. This benchmark shows that enabling a GPU to your Kernel results in a 12. 5X speedup total run time with only a CPU is 13. Then select the checkbox for Enable GPU. That said the GPU opens up much great possibilities in Kaggle kernels. Our model will view these images and learn to classify what sign is made in each image. But you are better off without a GPU for most other tasks. Moreover many data science libraries cannot take advantage of a GPU. Verify the GPU is attached to your kernel in the console bar where it should show GPU ON next to your resource usage metrics. So GPU s will be valuable for some tasks especially when using deep learning libraries like TensorFlow Keras and PyTorch. The exact speed up varies based on a number of factors including model architecture batch size input pipeline complexity etc. The total run time for the kernel with only a CPU is 13 419 seconds. So the model training speed up is a little over 13X. Limiting the comparison only to model training we see a reduction from 13 378 seconds on CPU to 950 seconds with a GPU. The total run time with a GPU is 994 seconds. Adding a GPUWe set up this kernel to run on a GPU by first opening the kernel controls. png ___ GPU backed instances have less CPU power and RAM. 5X speedup during training of a deep learning model. The following text shows how to enable a GPU and gives details on the benchmark. com dansbecker benchmarking model training with a cpu.
