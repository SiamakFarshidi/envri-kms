Structure of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus receptor binding domain complexed with neutralizing antibody. We can see that the mRNA is an identical copy with the T base replaced by U 3 Translation Translation is the process that takes the information passed from DNA as messenger RNA and turns it into a series of amino acids. com max 700 1 7pJ7RB9UcKH12gGBi3MBEQ. Luckily with the translate function python does translate the mRNA to amino acids chains. How does this translation happen As in any language we need a dictionary for translation in this case the amino acid dictionary is the table below. All together this collection of codon amino acid relationships is called the genetic code because it lets cells decode an mRNA into a chain of amino acids. I filter and keep just the proteins with more than 50 amino acids to have a shorter list of proteins to analyse. BLAST basic local alignment search tool is an algorithm and program for comparing primary biological sequence information such as the amino acid sequences of proteins or the nucleotides of DNA and or RNA sequences. Structural basis of neutralization by a human anti severe acute respiratory syndrome spike protein antibody 80R. uk Tools sss psiblast search was used to compare our COVID 19 proteins with the SARS and Bat coronavirus proteins.

COVID 19 Genetic information 2. So the question here is How do we extract information from this long sequence of letters This process is called gene expression Gene expression is the process by which information from a gene is used in the synthesis of a functional gene product. Translation 4. We set the minimum protein length to 200 amino acids. It s worth to mention that not all the amino acids sequences are proteins. The nucleotides are read in groups of three AUG GCC CAG UUA. As expected all the viral proteins have high similarities with viral proteins in SARS and Bat coronaviruses. 3 The mRNA was translated to 9967 amino acids. Now that we have the protein sequences we will use the BLAST search. 3 ORFs identification The Covid 19 genome has 6 ORFs with more than 200 amino acids. gov pubmed 16597622 16 Hwang WC Lin Y Santelli E Sui J Jaroszewski L et al.

In other words we will try to find the protein sequences already available in the databases that are the most similar to our protein sequences. In studies related to SARS CoV vaccine candidates were developped expressing the membrane anchored SARS CoV spike S protein. Evidence of GC ratio with that of length of the coding region of a gene has shown that the length of the coding sequence is directly proportional to higher G C content.
