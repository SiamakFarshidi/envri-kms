Smartt Queen s University Belfast https www. All said then you should expect to find that Galactic sources have a different sort of distribution of dust along the line of sight to them than extragalactic sources. It s intended to provide some domain knowledge to data scientists taking part in the challenge and may even prove useful to some of the astronomers competing. The correction we applied to the light curves can be described by a single number for our Milky Way. _Figure 1 The LSST Telescope Credit LSST NSF AURA Todd Mason Productions Inc_The telescope is going to have a 3. We can rotate the sky so that the plane of our galaxy defines the equator like so _Figure 21 The sky in galactic coordinates with a equatorial coordinate grid overlaid_where I m leaving the celestial coordinate grid in yellow notice how they no longer correspond to the North and South relative to the plane of our Galaxy. If the source is moving towards us things are shifted to the blue or higher frequencies while if the source is moving away from us things are shifted to the red or lower frequencies. And the data at the time suggested that this increase was linear. The light from the supernova explosion changes with time and therefore so do the spectra. This isn t all that different from the Doppler shift of the sound of an ambulance or police siren moving across you it ll increase in frequency as the vehicle approaches you and decrease in frequency as it moves away. Astronomers can map this structure using careful observations of lots of stars. The UNIX epoch in MJD is 40587 or JD 2440587. We don t provide another column for distance modulus that was derived from hostgal_specz but there s a lookup table included with the dataset if you need to compute this you probably don t. Let s start by taking a look at the metadata table a stub of which is provided with the starter kit That s a fair number of fields. We can t really simulate it from previous surveys because none of them achieve the same sort of signal to noise that LSST will one of the big motivations for building LSST in the first place. Objects for which the total flux from source and background is higher than that of the template have positive flux and when the total flux is lower than the template flux they have have negative flux. We could move to any other point in the Universe and we d see the same behavior. 2 gigapixel camera and a similar field of view to LSST but is a much smaller telescope. This coordinate system makes sense if you are building a telescope on Earth in the southern hemisphere and have to decide how you want to observe the sky. These light curves have realistic time sampling and noise properties as well as realistic astrophysical effects for a variety of the sources in the variability tree. Galactic Coordinates section4b 4c. Light Curves Time series of Brightness of Astronomical SourcesScanning the entire sky repeatedly means we can identify astrophysical sources in the night sky that change in brightness over time and we can create a plot of the the brightness vs time. _Figure 4 The light curve of supernova 1998bu. You can learn more about it here. appear to be moving faster than the speed of light And you might have heard that it isn t possible to go faster than the speed of light. Cosmology section4e 4f. That tells you they are within the galaxy and reduces the size of the possible models they might be but doesn t identify which is which that s still your challenge Most machine learning techniques will pick this feature of redshift up easily but you might use it to build separate classifiers for extragalactic and galactic sources if you like. The Large Synoptic Survey TelescopePLAsTiCC is intended to simulate sources that vary with time in the night sky as seen during the first three years of operation of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope LSST. 4 meter primary mirror diameter being built high up in Atacama desert of Chile on a mountain called Cerro Pachon. As the source flux changes with time some sources can have some flux entries as positive and others that are negative. Here s a construction picture from August 2018 and it is looking a lot like the render at the top of this page _Figure 13 The LSST telescope under construction on Cerro Pachon in Chile Credit Gianluca Lombardi Gemini Observatory_ 2. You will not need to correct the light curves anymore but you might be able to use this piece of metadata to distinguish some populations from others using clustering techniques for instance. This is Hubble s plot of his measurements _Figure 26. _Dispersing the light like this is called spectroscopy and allows us to look for characteristic atomic signatures from astrophysical sources. This is because of how we actually detect these sources against the background sky. It s not the physical motion of the sources that is causing the change in frequency but rather the expansion of the Universe itself that the space between us and the source is stretching Your PLAsTiCC dataset will include objects up to a redshift of 3. Exploring the Light Curves section3 4. in its entire 28 year life. This Kaggle Kernel provides an introduction to some of the astrophysics that might be relevant for the Photometric LSST Astronomical Time series Classification Challenge PLAsTiCC on Kaggle. Each object has observations in every passband. There s only one filter in front of the camera at any time. The LSST illustrated below is a telescope with an 8. _This is the most reliable method for determining what a point of light in the night sky actually is and there s a ton of information you can get from it. v_r H_0 cdot D sim c cdot z where D is the luminosity distance to the object and the dot cdot operator is a shorthand for the multiplication times operator. A Primer on the Dataset Light CurvesWe ve included some example light curve data along with this Kernel to illustrate some of the astrophysical effects you ll encounter in the full data set. Folding the observations to this period takes that noisy time series and shows you some of the structure in the data. and the Declination often just Dec. Which objects are in the WFD vs the DDF are specified by the ddf_bool column in the header 1 if in DDF 0 otherwise. LSST presents us with a great opportunity here because it will find an order of magnitude or more of these kinds of events than astronomers have ever observed. The data from these two images on the same night are combined to remove spurious glitches like cosmic rays asteroids airplane contrails etc. So they did the simple thing and made the reference date of the VAX VMS system the same as the reference date for their new time system creatively named the Modified Julian date and consequently most of astronomy. This is a counterintuitive consequence of Einstein s General Theory of Relativity and living in a Universe that is homogeneous same from all positions and isotropic same in all directions. DustDepending on where you are looking on the sky there s a lot of structure in our Milky Way lanes of gas and dust obscure the view of stars and galaxies behind it. We refer to the total transmission of each filter as the passband and often use the terms interchangeably. _There s a lot that we can get out of understanding the time domain of our Universe. At present we classify the sources not using just their light curves but using more detailed follow up with other telescopes. _Figure 16 The ligt curve of FAKE030 looks a bit more messy. Also some classes of objects exhibit stochastic variability they don t repeat periodically but they do change more on some time scales than others. Hubble s Hubble Diagram showing the Universe expanding Credit Edwin Hubble_We call this the Hubble Law and this kind of plot a Hubble Diagram well Hubble didn t he called it Figure 1. com articles nature11643_The light curves of these explosive transients can look radically different from the light curves of periodic variables. This is also in the lookup table. Lines of constant Right Ascension and Declination are in grey while the green lines indicate a coordinate transform where the plane of the galaxy defines the equatorial plane instead of the Earth s equator a galactic coordinate system. You can see it with your own eyes from a dark site in the southern hemisphere. This becomes even more apparent if we look with a different instrument and in a different passband more sensitive to only the dust. _Figure 10 The Atlas of Variable Stars Credit Popular Science Monthly from 1906_The variables here from left to right top to bottom are a Mira an eclipsing binary and RR Lyrae of type AB and an RR Lyrae of type C. It s worth noting that while astrophysical sources have to emit enough light to be brighter than the background sky more or less the definition of what a source is the flux can be positive or negative. The photometric redshift is sometimes wrong. compute the features and save the features we can also construct features between passbands this is a simple routine to visualize a light curve it can plot vs the MJD array of the light curve or vs an optional phase array that you pass we ll window the search range by setting minimums and maximums here but in general the search range you want to evaluate will depend on the data and you will not be able to window like this unless you know something about the class of the object a priori. The other fuzzy blob near it is called the Small Magellanic Cloud. It s not a measured distance to each source actually measuring distances is complicated. Those pixel numbers may not seem all that meaningful without a reference so here is the LSST field of view FoV compared against the full moon and a similar class telescope _Figure 2 The LSST Field of View compared to a camera on a similar telescope and the Moon. The two rows correspond to roughly the r filter and the i filter. Hubble did this by measuring the distances to these galaxies using a special class of variable stars called Cepheids see that figure from Popular Science Monthly again for an example that have a relation between their period and how intrinsically bright they are. This is a purely computed quantity and is provided for convenience. It s got a characteristic time scale but you wouldn t know it from a simple light curve plot. The specific time format we will use in PLAsTiCC is called the Modified Julian Date MJD simply the number of decimal days from midnight on November 17 1858. The Hubble Space Telescope only has a 2. The original version of this kernel is available as a Jupyter Notebook on LSST DESC GitHub. Whether or not they were detected with respect to the template is reported as detected_bool. The difference is even more stark when compared against telescopes that are both smaller and have smaller FoVs like most everything astronomers have access to now. On any given night LSST will begin by taking a picture of one patch for 15 30 seconds long the results from PLAsTiCC might help decide the exposure time. If you watched that video of the supernova video carefully you ll have noticed that there s actually two traces of the brightness one that covers the optical and one that covers the infrared. Unfortunately spectroscopy takes a tremendous amount of telescope time and there aren t enough telescopes in the world _combined_ to keep up with the LSST event rate. Consequently we also give you an estimate of the 68 uncertainty on the photometric redshift which itself might be inaccurate. There s a few because we simulate occasionally getting lucky and finding a new source in a galaxy which already had spectroscopy but the vast majority of them will be NaN. There s less detailed information available but you can still use it to identify people you see and categorize them into family friends co workers strangers etc. _Figure 8 The diversity of Supernovae Light Curves Credit Stephen J. Lets begin by looking at the format of the light curve and explaining what the columns are we ll get to the header in Section 3 The first of the columns is just the object_id. This is called text MW E B V MW Milky Way E Extinction between the Blue and Visual or B V and reported in the header in the column named mwebv. CosmologyIn fact you might notice that all of the redshifts are positive almost everything is moving away from us In 1927 Georges Lema\u00eetre proposed that this meant the Universe was expanding. We ll begin by defining a class to handle this example with a few illustrative features you can use for classification Some of the light curves in the training set should already look familiar this is a type Ia supernova like SN1998bu in the animation. LSST will repeat this cycle returning to the original filter on the original patch of sky 1 2 weeks later. You also don t need this but it is cool to get a sense for the history of our Universe. Most astronomers only specialize in a few kinds of objects though so even their domain knowledge isn t complete. 2m telescope at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory. html_The exact details of each eclipsing binary system determine the properties of the light curve how bright each star is their relative sizes how fast they orbit each other but all of these events have the same general light curve shape. 4 meter mirror and here s it s FoV. object_id gives you that index. How Astronomers have Studied Astronomical Sources Thus FarTo determine the class of any particular astrophysical source we currently need lots of observational data. PassbandThe next column labeled passband tells you the passband that the observation at time mjd was taken. A view of our cosmic neighborhoodYou might already have noticed the fuzzy blob in the Southern hemisphere below and to the right of center of our galaxy in galactic coordinates. If you prefer to work with galactic coordinates instead of equatorial coordinates ra and decl these are provided in the header in the columns gall and galb. Here s an illustration of one of these source supernova 1998bu imaged with the 1. The time series of these change in brightness. Our atmosphere scatters blue light more than the red light making the sun and the moon appear more red than if we could see them from space. _It ll likely answers questions we don t even know to ask yet. Additionally if you remember the video of the supernova you saw it getting brighter initially and then getting fainter. We can use a Fourier technique known as the Lomb Scargle Periodogram to estimate the characteristic scale at least given some search range. These sources even closely related classes can have light curves that look quite different from each other. Many of the redshifts of these nearby galaxies was first measured by Vesto Slipher back in 1917. We use a spherical coordinate system on the sky with the positions of stars indexed by a two tuple that describes where they were on the 1st of January in the year 2000. There s a problem though to measure this accurately we need _spectroscopy_. Wiki has a good illustration of this coordinate system Figure 18 Equatorial coordinates Credit https en. Here s an incomplete tree diagram of the various kinds of variable sources in the night sky _Figure 5 The hierarchy of variable and transient sources. _Figure 24 The low redshift Universe Credit Tom Jarrett IPAC Caltech_Our spectrographs are sensitive enough for it to have been possible to measure these redshifts even a century ago. With PLAsTiCC since we re simulating the time series we don t have the full breadth of this contextual information. If you can t see the stars on a cloudy night then it s probably not good conditions to try and get a spectrum. The third panel has the difference between the two and you can see there s some light left over near the fuzzy galaxy. In the real data you ll get many objects in the same CSV and you ll need some way of getting all the observations for one object. in addition to taking much longer to collect enough photons to have a statistically significant measurement. _Figure 6 A prism dispersing light creating a spectrum open access jpeg. Because the characteristic times that we conduct our observations on is a day we can t observe when the sun is up after all we measure time in units of decimal day. This view from ESA s Planck satellite really drives that home _Figure 29 A dust map of the Milky Way from Planck Credit ESA NASA JPL Caltech_Of course the dust isn t a single layer and has 3D structure. The PLAsTiCC Challenge Classifying Astronomical Sources with Light CurvesPLAsTiCC is based on a simulation of the light curves that LSST can expect to collect it doesn t exist yet so we can t give you real LSST data. Measure how bright they appear and compare the two and you ve got yourself a measurement of the distance. relative to one of those full moons _Figure 3 The Hubble Space Telescope s field of view compared to the Moon_Hubble isn t just looking at a smaller piece of sky it is also collecting light from this region much more slowly than LSST. The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope section1a 1b. This is followed by a gap of 30 minutes 2 hours the results from PLAsTiCC might help decide this too where the telescope looks at other patches of sky before coming back to the original patch of sky. The PLAsTiCC Challenge Classifying Astronomical Sources with Light Curves section1d 2. Figure 15 The light curve of FAKE010 a supernova Credit Richard Kessler University of Chicago SNPhotCC You might look at something like this light curve and try to estimate something like a full width at half maximum to determine a time scale. The PLAsTiCC Astronomy Starter Kit Gautham Narayan 20180831This kernel was developed for PLAsTiCC on Kaggle. Each image it takes of a particular region is differenced with the template. 2 gigapixel camera that s about the size of an adult human to take images of the night sky. If you like photography LSST has a 6. That s it Phew It s the minimal bits of the astrophysics you may need to make sense of the data and start to tackle this challenge. This is also one of the reasons why LSST is being built on top of a mountain high in the Atacama desert of Chile it s far away from bright city lights and the sky background is lower allowing us to detect fainter sources. Consequently the light curves will have better sampling and potentially be found farther away in our Universe but there s fewer objects. The third number we use to locate objects in 3D space isn t even a distance from the origin it s a speed We call it the redshift. This is where PLAsTiCC and you come in. That wouldn t be a bad idea for type Ia supernovae but of course not everything in the dataset is a supernova. That s a data rate of 20 40 terabytes or about 1 US Library of Congress every night. As the sun gets near the horizon and the light from it has to pass through more of the Earth s atmosphere to reach us it appears even redder than when it is high in the sky. If we color the galaxies in the nearby Universe that we can see from Earth by redshift with a small telescope there are many sources that we can see with higher redshifts. The same event rate also presents a new challenge supernovae aren t the only sorts of variable and transient events in the night sky. As we look to farther horizons to determine the expansion history of the Universe takes the equations of Einstein s General Theory of Relativity. If you find this stuff fascinating you might want to read this. You ll notice quickly that they don t always agree with the photometric redshift. And you d be right But there s another astrophysical effect that affects the determination of time scales and colors and this one has nothing to do with the nature of the object what it is but rather where it is. That s about 163 miles second or 262 km s fast but less than a thousandth of the speed of light. hopefully things are beginning to fit together and this is giving you a sense for the big picture You might prefer to have the y axis called the distance modulus related to the base 10 logarithm of the luminosity distance rather than the redshift provided in hostgal_photoz. hostgal_photoz_err. A view of our cosmic neighborhood section4d 4e. Be warned though that the actual photometric redshift distribution is asymmetric and the redshift is not likely to be less than zero so you might want to treat it as just a weight. Astrophysics is interesting stuff though and if you are curious and want to know more about something or how to do something that isn t covered here then just ask You ll find us on the Kaggle forum for this challenge Contents 1. This is also the same character as the z passband in LSST and other surveys but the two aren t related. You can convert the change in frequency or wavelength into a speed using z frac lambda_ text Source lambda_ text Earth lambda_ text Earth frac Delta lambda lambda sim frac v_r c where z is the redshift lambda_ text Earth is the original wavelength we measure on Earth and Delta lambda is the change in wavelength v_r is the recession velocity and c is the speed of light. Something is _pushing_ distant galaxies away from us at an ever increasing rate This is one of the best current map of that expansion using type Ia supernovae _Figure 27. You can see the properties of the two sets of images are different. We ll give you a few external resources for these events in a companion Kernel if you are determined to augment the training set. This 3D map was made with the Pan STARRS telescope which has a 1. Still you might look at the RR Lyrae and supernova light curve and conclude that extracting information about shape and the relative strengths of the signal in different passbands is a promising way to encode the information on each object. LSST PLAsTiCC and You section1 1a. The advantage of LSST and its giant camera is that it can take an image of several 100 000 astrophysical sources through a single filter at the same time. We re all used to this effect we see it with our Sun and Moon everyday. This example data is simpler than the real data it has only four of the six passbands and different properties from the full sample so that the signal is more obvious and only a few classes. Credit Abhijit Saha NOAO _This object for instance is something very different it s a variable star. LSST data will be useful for many different scientific studies by different groups from studying stars in our Galaxy to understand how solar systems like ours formed probing nuclear physics with brief burps before stars explode how galaxies themselves formed and the role massive stars play in shaping their chemistry to measuring how much matter there is in our Universe and everything in between. Yet others like supernovae typically explode once and fade away. Hubble s Glass Plate notice the Var in the corner. For your convenience this is provided in the header as a column named distmod. There s a much higher background in the bottom row thanks to a bright source off to the top right. Additionally extragalactic sources can also suffer from extinction _in their own host galaxies. Take for instance the eclipsing binary system Y Piscium. Consequently each and every week LSST will find more sources that vary with time than Hubble has ever seen. Therefore in the header you get two redshifts hostgal_specz is the spectroscopic redshift of the host galaxy of an event while hostgal_photoz is the photometric redshift of the host galaxy. The same spectroscopy that is expensive and hard to get to classify transients which is the raison d \u00eatre for PLAsTiCC in the first place. Note that there s been exactly one kilonova event ever seen we hope this will be out of date by the time LSST turns on though so it s not really possible to provide multiple examples in some cases 1c. corresponding to longitude and latitude on the Earth. The JLA Hubble Diagram Credit Marc Betoule Paris Center for Cosmological Physics _Hubble s data covers such a small range that it doesn t even show up on this plot. This linear relation between redshift and distance is approximate hence the sim sign. The other reason why this is using example data and not the training data supplied with the challenge is that we ve identified the target classes in the challenge with random integers. These two angles are called the Right Ascension R. Exploring the Light CurvesTo get a better sense of what the flux and flux_err look like let s take a look at some of their light curves. Dust section4f 1. So we ve got to identify such type Ia supernovae among all of the ones that LSST will find. First you should get a sense for what the pattern of LSST observations is. _ AN IMPORTANT NOTE _For historic reasons redshift is denoted with the letter z. You might even be able to spot some galaxies in the northern hemisphere but remember the sky in galactic coordinates doesn t look like the sky you d see from Earth The redshift of the Large Magellanic Cloud is a whopping 0. 5 so you d use textrm UNIX time textrm MJD 40587 times 86400 where 86400 is the number of seconds in 24 hours. TimeThe second column labeled mjd is the time that LSST took an image. 5 meter effective aperture and a focal ratio of f of 1. The sources in the training set are from a mixture of these different astrophysical classes including Secular Pulsating and Eruptive Variable Stars Tidal Disruption Events Kilonovae Supernovae of different types Active Galactic Nucleii Microlensing Events Eclipsing BinariesThe diversity of these sources is important. 5 because the VAX reference starts at midnight while the Julian Date starts from noon. Flux and Flux ErrorThe last two columns in this file are named flux contains the actual photometry the measurements of brightness of this source as a function of time. How much light gets through each filter depends not only on the properties of the filter but really the transmission of everything between the camera and the source the atmosphere dust in our galaxy dust in the galaxy of the source. Different rise and fall times different absolute energies a different structure of bumps and wiggles. This date is conveniently 2400000. In other words each object has six time series you can use for classification. Flux and Flux Error section2c 3. Credit LSST Corporation_PLAsTiCC simulates the Wide Fast Deep Survey the main LSST program and the Deep Drilling Fields a few small regions where LSST will get more observations for specialized scientific studies. Active galactic nucleii massive black holes surrounded by hot dust and gas at the centers of galaxies exhibit this kind of behavior. Note that you can also get this information from the object_id column object_id 1 000 000 are in DDF. Hubble was using visual inspection for classification Credit Carnegie Observatories_Measure the period of a Cepheid and you figure out how bright they are supposed to be. You ll have to design your algorithm with speed as a consideration. These simplifications will make it easier to work with and highlight some of the issues you ll encounter will the full dataset. Some sources vary periodically while others show random or stochastic behavior. If you want another time format like UNIX time which counts decimal seconds from a reference date of Jan 1st 1970 then it s easy to convert between the two. The passbands that LSST will use are called u g r i z and y. That said redshift is a great feature We know how to separate extragalactic and galactic sources pretty well so we simulate this ability by setting the redshifts of galactic sources to exactly 0. LSST will have a reference image for each position on the sky called a template. The test set does not have spectroscopic redshifts for all sources. Come help us explore the Universe cheesy You can edit the font size here to make rendered text more comfortable to read It was built on a 13 retina screen with 18px we ll also use this package to read tables it s generally useful for astrophysics work including this challenge so we d suggest installing it even if you elect to work with pandas this is some simple code to demonstrate how to calculate features on these multiband light curves we re not suggesting using these features specifically there also might be additional pre processing you do before computing anything it s purely for illustration in this example we ll use the weighted mean to normalize the features define some functions to compute simple descriptive statistics we ll save the measurements in each passband to simplify access. When the Soviet Sputnik launched the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory decided to make this zero reference date a little more current. Other fields have similar issues if we wanted to uniquely identify a human being for instance we could test a DNA sample but that d be completely impractical given the number of people we encounter. We hope you have fun and we look forward to your submissions remember your work will influence the entire LSST project. This is entirely up to you and the two sets of objects are weighted exactly the same irrespective of which field they originated from. Because of this difference imaging techniques objects have to have changed significantly with respect to the template to be detected by LSST. we ll get to that in a bit. _Figure 22 Redshift is a measure of how fast a distant source with more distant on the top is moving relative to us along the line of sight and is determined from how much the wavelength or alternately the frequency of the absorption and emission lines of atoms change relative to what we see here on Earth bottom panel _Redshift is so named because if you take the light from distance astrophysical sources and pass it through a prism you see the same atomic fingerprint of elements and molecules you find here on Earth. To do well in PLAsTiCC though you ll have to classify everythingYou can even expect sources in the test set that aren t in the training set we expect to find new classes of objects with LSST that we ve never seen before and we ve simulated light curves based on theoretical predictions of how they ought to look Your mission should you choose to accept it is to classify the things that go bump in the night. You can win prizes eternal glory and the satisfaction of knowing that you made a real impact and a valuable contribution to the biggest astrophysical experiment to ever be attempted There s not much time too LSST is coming up fast. Here s a hand drawn illustration of some of the different known types of variable stars from Popular Science Monthly in 1906 page 179. This also means that they ll have different light curves. rotation or forming part of a binary system that just happens to eclipse along our line of sight from Earth. RedshiftThe position of a source on the sky is a tuple of two numbers in either equatorial or galactic coordinates but we live in a Universe with at least 3 spatial dimensions. We call these time series light curves. Indeed variable stars were the first example of astronomers using light curve shapes for classification. Largely we use facial recognition. We try to obtain a spectrum close to when the object is brightest but often we can t schedule a telescope in advance exactly then and even when we do the weather might not cooperate. For some objects the contribution from the source will fade over time leaving just the background which is about the same level as the flux in the template so some flux entries will be consistent with zero. Also the training set is not perfectly representative we can usually only classify the brightest objects we find with spectroscopy. _Figure 30 A Fly Through of our Galaxy s Dust Credit Gregory Green Stanford KIPAC _Dust like increasing luminosity distance and therefore redshift in our Universe makes things fainter and redder. Galactic CoordinatesRA and Dec are equatorial coordinates a coordinate system where the Earth s equator is extended outwards into infinity and splits space into an imaginary north and south hemisphere. You can get a clearer view of it from ESA s GAIA satellite without a coordinate grid on top. Comparing how the galaxy looks in this projection should help make sense of the otherwise weird looking pattern of observations that LSST plans to obtain _Figure 20 The LSST minion 1016 exposure map in celestial coordinates. For galactic objects with hostgal_photoz 0 the distmod is reported as NaN the distance would be 0 and taking the logarithm of 0 is a bad idea. As we look farther our we look further back in time. With a spectrum you can distinguish absorption and emission lines of atomic lines that are a few Angstroms across the symbol for it is an A with the circle on top very approximately 10 000 times smaller than the width of an average strange of human hair. Your eyes are sensitive to just the g and r bands_The training sample is what the entire astronomical community can expect to have before LSST turns on except where astronomers have a mishmash of observations from different telescopes something you ll have to deal with if you decide and try to augment it from the literature you get a nice homogeneous training set. the wavelength of light hasn t exactly changed much. This is how the cosmological redshift differs from the Doppler effect. You saw that different kinds of supernovae have different spectra. We use spectrographs instruments that much like a prism disperse a beam of light spreading different colors over position to study astrophysical sources. Historical parenthetical The original Julian Date which began counting up from zero on noon on Jan 1 4713 BC. _Figure 23 The GAIA view of our Galaxy Credit ESA GAIA_This fuzzy blob below and to the right of center is called the Large Magellanic cloud a companion galaxy to our Milky Way. _Figure 7 Spectra of different kinds of supernovae with their atomic signatures labeled Credit Daniel Kasen UC Berkeley. In a companion Kernel plasticc_classification_demo we ll build a toy classifier on the challenge data and introduce some of the useful packages astronomers use to tackle this problem. How Astronomers have Studied Astronomical Sources Thus Far section1c 1d. Eclipsing binaries are still called Algol type stars some times but note that they look really different from the bottom two panels and if you look at the x axis on the horizontal panel you ll notice that the characteristic time scale there is much different from the rest of them And you have more information than just the one time series. This should help reduce astronomer s advantage of domain knowledge astronomers will have to identify which class corresponds to which integers before they can take advantage of their understanding of the properties of different classes. This Kernel does not need the actual challenge data. Why is the redshift unlikely to be less than 0. Still it s a fairly reliable way to extract a period from an irregularly sampled recurring time series. If everything seems to be moving away with respect to us on Earth you might also be tempted to think we re the center of the expansion of the Universe. Measuring this expansion history takes bright sources that we can determine the distance to like those type Ia supernovae like SN1998bu. This pattern of how a telescope observes the night sky is called the cadence and it has a large effect on how well the light curve of an astrophysical source is sampled. and would be useful for classification. Primer cont d Metadata Provided with Light CurvesReal astrophysical data is from sources on the sky which means that we normally have contextual information in addition to the light curve to help with classification if a source is near a galaxy or if it is isolated for instance. Even the biggest spectrographs with optical fibers dedicated to each sources can only manage a few thousand sources at most. Time section2a 2b. While we can t give you all the contextual information we do provide some metadata a few essential elements that you _may_ want to use to augment the features extracted directly from the light curves this has pluses and minuses. The test set is a version what we expect to have after 3 years of LSST operations. LSST will then come back to the same patch of sky the next night but it will take the picture in a different passband. Credit Peter Challis Harvard CfA_ The left panel shows you how the supernova event looked while the right panel shows a plot of the brightness of the supernova measured using a process called photometry used to determine the light curve. _Figure 17 The folded light curve of FAKE030 after determining a period using the Lomb Scargle algorithm_This folded curve is suitable for feature extraction but we don t a priori know what objects have periodic structure and which ones don t. object_id is a simple integer ID number that uniquely identifies each object and corresponds to the object s ID in the light curve files but the rest might not be familiar. _ ANOTHER IMPORTANT NOTE _The training set has spectroscopic redshifts for all sources. The SAO needed a way to keep track of Sputnik s orbits but the reference for the Julian date was so far in the past that the numbers were too large for their VAX VMS system to handle. This is because our telescope detectors are sensitive to wavelengths of light well beyond the range our eyes can see. You ll notice the map in the video is higher resolution towards the center of the galaxy where there are more stars and lower resolution in the opposite direction for instance. Credit Zelko Ivezic LSST_This large FoV is what makes LSST so revolutionary. The first widely known measurement of this expansion rate came two years later from Edwin Hubble who showed definitely that the further galaxies were from our own the faster they were moving away. Because the speed of light is fixed and the distance to sources is increasing you can also compute a how long it took for light from a source at some redshift took to reach up. Light Curves Time series of Brightness of Astronomical Sources section1b 1c. org wiki Right_ascension If we unroll the sky into a flat Aitoff projection we can get a view of the entire sky _Figure 19 The sky in equatorial coordinates with a galactic coordinate grid overlaid_Splitting the sky into two hemispheres by extending the Earth s equator outwards the Milky Way forms a graceful arc. You can also safely ignore it and dive right in and do things your own way. _Figure 12 The throughput of the LSST passbands with wavelength. It is for want of a better word ginormous. Here s a visual timeline of the history of our Universe _Figure 28. The DDFs will have more observations but cover a much smaller chunk of sky. While there s no practical way to cover all of the background astrophysics in a single Kernel there should be enough relevant material to tackle the challenge. But just as with this challenge there s a solution that involves getting images through broad passbands and extracting ratios of brightness in different passbands to get an estimator of the redshift. Unlike other multi channel time series data you do not get all the other channels or passbands at once. It s much much bigger than the training set. When scientists used type Ia supernovae to do this for the first time in 1998 they discovered something remarkable that the Universe wasn t just expanding but the expansion was accelerating. Coordinates on the Sky section4a 4b. This particular source was a supernova but the same technique can be used to identify all manner of variable and transient sources in astronomical images. Here s the filter exchanger for the LSST camera adult human for scale _Figure 11 LSST Filter Exchanger Credit LSST NSF AURA Todd Mason Productions Inc_This is a bit like taking a low resolution spectrum the light is still being split up and we re getting information about different colors but it s not as detailed. These coordinates are supplied in the ra and decl columns of the metadata table. We ve done a lot in 80 years The teams that discovered this won the Nobel prize for their work in 2011. It will then take another 15 30 second picture. If you have more questions you can find the PLAsTiCC dev team on the Kaggle forums and we ll do our best to answer your questions if we can. We need to invent new techniques to classify astrophysical sources without using the detailed DNA sample that you d get from spectroscopy but using the less detailed information in their light curves their photometry. But if we re talking about objects in the distant Universe it makes sense to not make the Earth the center of it. Passband section2b 2c. This means that LSST can make a map of the entire southern sky resolving details that are smaller than the width of a human hair held at arm s length. That said we re being deliberately vague about exactly what sorts of astrophysical sources you ll find in the data and even what target number in the data corresponds to what astrophysical class. The 68 confidence interval of the measurement is in the flux_err column. Coordinates on the SkyThe next few columns of metadata are related to an object s position in our three spatial dimensions. which is what you want to determine.

This is an eclipsing binary system a name which the animation below should help explain with a light curve that looks like this _Figure 9 The light curves of an eclipsing binary system Credit AstroLab Durham University https community. Primer cont d Metadata Provided with Light Curves section4 4a. While the light curves we ve provided are corrected for the dimming and reddening called the extinction along the line of sight in our Galaxy this correction isn t perfect because we ve not got perfect knowledge of how much dust there is along any line of sight. If you look at the light curve below and compare it to the hand drawn diagram of variable stars from 1906 bearing in mind that it s period is a bit less than 12 hours you should be able to classify it pretty easily. Redshift section4c 4d. Here s how that looks _Figure 14 Difference Imaging Postage Stamps Reference Image Difference _The template image in the left panels is from 2004 while the current images are from 2007. And of course depending on the period the time scale of the variability can be anything from hours to years Other variable stars have very different light curve shapes from eclipsing binaries. Historical parenthetical See Milone and Young 2008 Sec. Credit Laurent Eyer and Nami Mowlawi Universit\u00e9 de Gen\u00e8ve_Some sources are intrinsically variable while others are extrinsic they vary not because they the source itself has some fundamental physical property that causes them to vary but rather because of extra attributes e. We ve mapped the passband names to integers but the mapping is straightforward u rightarrow 0 g rightarrow 1 r rightarrow 2 i rightarrow 3 z rightarrow 4 y rightarrow 5 You probably guessed as much looking at Figure 10 but u covers the ultraviolet g covers what your eye perceives as blue green r covers red i covers the infrared. A Primer on the Data Light Curves section2 2a. Each image then includes a contribution from the source and the background. More on why it is called this later. _ Galactic sources are nearer us and brighter and because they are _in_ our Galaxy they are likely to be in the plane. We use optical filters elements that only permit a certain range of wavelengths to pass through to measure the brightness in different passbands. General relativity in the expanding Universe gives us a time machine. You can watch a video about how we do it here. Each filter is a summing the total amount of light in one small region of the spectrum so you can t measure narrow atomic lines anymore but you can get many more light curves in the time it takes to get one spectrum. I m not even going to pretend that z and Y have good reasons to be named what they are. You could potentially try to use the training set together with the subset of the test data that does have both spectroscopic and photometric redshifts to make a better redshift predictor if you like or you could ignore it altogether.
