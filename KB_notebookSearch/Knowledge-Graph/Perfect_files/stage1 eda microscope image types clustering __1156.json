More details here https www. It starts from this interesting thread https www. It looks we have the following breakdown fluorescent 81. grab the number of different clusters and create a histogram based on the number of pixels assigned to each cluster normalize the histogram such that it sums to one. com c data science bowl 2018 discussion 47640 about image types. com nhargan defining microscopy type. We keep only RGB channels as Alpha channel is always empty. It can complete this other kernel https www. Run KMeans on each image. KMeans to split images by 3 types based on dominant HSV colors distributions Plot some examples for each cluster. Some examples of cluster 0 fluorescent images Some examples of cluster 1 histological slides Some examples of cluster 2 bright field images Plot some images with masks linear algebra data processing CSV file I O e. com 2014 05 26 opencv python k means color clustering. Centroids provide dominant colors based on provided colorspace. read_csv Drop alpha which is not used Get image width height and count masks available.
