Multivariate analysis 9 Heat Map 9. 2 Analysis of target and thalach variable 8. Frequency distribution of target variable Comment 1 stands for presence of heart disease. Multivariate non graphical EDAMultivariate non graphical EDA techniques show the relationship between two or more variables in the form of either cross tabulation or statistics. So we can see that there is no variable which has strong positive correlation with target variable. So in this kernel I have conducted Exploratory Data Analysis or EDA of the heart disease dataset. If we simply want to check the data type of a particular column we can use the following command. We can use Pandas series object to get an informative axis label as follows We can plot the distribution on the vertical axis as follows Seaborn Kernel Density Estimation KDE Plot The kernel density estimate KDE plot is a useful tool for plotting the shape of a distribution. It is integer valued as it contains two integers 0 and 1 0 stands for absence of heart disease and 1 for presence of heart disease. References 14 1. sum It returns the total number of missing values in the dataframe. We have analyzed it alone and check its interaction with other variables. So there are 138 patients who do not have any heart disease. Outlier detection Back to Table of Contents 0. Extensive Analysis Visualization with Python Hello friends Heart disease or Cardiovascular disease CVD is a class of diseases that involve the heart or blood vessels. It enable us to answer all of the above questions. Outlier detection is also a part of this analysis. trestbps variable contains outliers to the right side. To get an overview of the distribution of the dataset. Now let the actual fun begin. Pair Plot Comment I have defined a variable num_var. Import libraries 4 1. Each of these types of EDA are described below i. any It checks which column has null values and which has not. The below list shed light on some of these questions What is the distribution of the dataset Are there any missing numerical values outliers or anomalies in the dataset What are the underlying assumptions in the dataset Whether there exists relationships between variables in the dataset How to be sure that our dataset is ready for input in a machine learning algorithm How to select the most suitable algorithm for a given dataset So how do we get answer to the above questions The answer is Exploratory Data Analysis. Discover patterns and relationships An important step in EDA is to discover patterns and relationships between variables in the dataset. But it also contains 0 and 1 as values. The next step is to import the datasets. 1 Estimate correlation coefficients Our dataset is very small. describe helps us to view the statistical properties of numerical variables. Table of ContentsThe table of contents for this project are as follows 1. This is true in all areas of the world except Africa. target and thalach variable are also mildly positively correlated correlation coefficient 0. The people suffering from heart disease target 1 have relatively higher heart rate thalach as compared to people who are not suffering from heart disease target 0. target variable also contains two integer values 1 and 0 1 Presence of heart disease 0 Absence of heart disease The above plot confirms our findings that Out of 96 females 72 have heart disease and 24 do not have heart disease. target and exang variable are mildly negatively correlated correlation coefficient 0. Analyze age and target variable Visualize frequency distribution of age variable wrt target Interpretation We can see that the people suffering from heart disease target 1 and people who are not suffering from heart disease target 0 have comparable ages. The columns which has null values returns TRUE and FALSE otherwise. Deaths at a given age from CVD are more common and have been increasing in much of the developing world while rates have declined in most of the developed world since the 1970s. They do not give full picture of the data. I will compute it using the df. The KDE plot plots the density of observations on one axis with height along the other axis. Useful commands to detect missing values df. Exploratory data analysis 6 Check shape of the dataset 6. References Back to Table of Contents 0. Bivariate analysis 8 Estimate correlation coefficients 8. First each method is either non graphical or graphical. So its data type is given as int64. If dataframe contains missing values it returns TRUE and FALSE otherwise. any It returns a boolean value indicating whether the dataframe has missing values or not. Types of EDA Back to Table of Contents 0. Analyze chol and thalach variable Interpretation The above plot shows that there is no correlation between chol and thalach variable. age variable Box plot of age variable trestbps variable Box plot of trestbps variable chol variable Box plot of chol variable thalach variable Box plot of thalach variable oldpeak variable Box plot of oldpeak variable Findings The age variable does not contain any outlier. We can see that the thalach variable is slightly negatively skewed. Outlier detection 12 1. These are simple functions that return a boolean value indicating whether the passed in argument value is in fact missing data. Findings of Univariate Analysis Findings of univariate analysis are as follows Our feature variable of interest is target. It excludes character variables. thalach variable contains a single outlier to the left side. Findings of Bivariate Analysis Findings of Bivariate Analysis are as follows There is no variable which has strong positive correlation with target variable. Second each method is either univariate or multivariate usually bivariate. 1 Pair Plot 9. Important points about dataset sex is a character variable. There are four types of exploratory data analysis EDA based on the above cross classification methods. Bivariate Analysis Back to Table of Contents 0. The dispersion or spread of age of the people who have heart disease is greater than the dispersion or spread of age of the people who do not have heart disease. target variable also contains two integer values 1 and 0 1 Presence of heart disease 0 Absence of heart disease So out of 96 females 72 have heart disease and 24 do not have heart disease. Import dataset Back to Table of Contents 0. target should also be a character variable. If we want to view the statistical properties of character variables we should run the following command df. So in this section I will analyze the target variable. Hence it is a categorical variable. We can plot a KDE plot as follows We can shade under the density curve and use a different color as follows Histogram A histogram represents the distribution of data by forming bins along the range of the data and then drawing bars to show the number of observations that fall in each bin. Check with ASSERT statement Back to Table of Contents 0. chol variable also contains outliers to the right side. But it is encoded as 1 male 0 female. It enable us to direct specific testing of the hypothesis. Those variables containing outliers needs further investigation. info command gives us the number of filled values along with the data types of columns. Check for missing numerical values outliers or other anomalies in the dataset. bar keyword arguments for a different look Comment I have visualize the target values distribution wrt sex. Plot the distribution of age variableNow I will plot the distribution of age variable to view the statistical properties. This gives us confidence that our code is running properly. Dealing with missing values 10 Pandas isnull and notnull functions 10. Assert statement will return nothing if the value being tested is true and will throw an AssertionError if the value is false. Similarly out of 207 males 93 have heart disease and 114 do not have heart disease. The feature variable of interest is target variable. The first step in the EDA journey is to import the libraries. In this kernel we have implemented many of the strategies presented in the book Think Stats Exploratory Data Analysis in Python by Allen B Downey. 1 The objectives of the EDA are as follows i. So there is no correlation between target and fbs. Dealing with missing values Back to Table of Contents 0. corr method as follows The target variable is target. When it is clsoe to 1 it means that there is a strong negative correlation. 1 We must confirm that our dataset has no missing values. 1 Analysis of target and cp variable 8. 1 The scene has been set up. target and ca variable are weakly negatively correlated correlation coefficient 0. So I will compute the standard correlation coefficient also called Pearson s r between every pair of attributes. Univariate analysis 7 Analysis of target feature variable 7. 1 Findings of univariate analysis 7. The non graphical methods are quantitative and objective. Univariate non graphical EDAThe objective of the univariate non graphical EDA is to understand the sample distribution and also to make some initial conclusions about population distributions. View the unique values in target variable Comment So the unique values are 1 and 0. Visualize frequency distribution of target variable Interpretation The above plot confirms the findings that There are 165 patients suffering from heart disease and There are 138 patients who do not have any heart disease. These are as follows Side by Side Boxplots Scatterplots Heat Maps and 3 D Surface PlotsEnough of theory now let the journey begin. So we can see that there is no variable which has strong negative correlation with target variable. Hence we need graphical methods which are more qualitative in nature and presents an overview of the data. So there are 4 unique values in cp variable. Visualize distribution of age variable wrt target with boxplot Interpretation The above boxplot tells two different things The mean age of the people who have heart disease is less than the mean age of the people who do not have heart disease. So I will analyze the interaction between these features and target variable. target and slope variable are weakly positively correlated correlation coefficient 0. The cp and thalach variables are mildly positively correlated with target variable. We have also discussed how to detect missing data and outliers. Import dataset 5 1. Check with ASSERT statement 11 1. It also contains only 0 and 1 as values so its data type is given as int64. 1 stands for presence of heart disease and 0 for absence of hear disease. The primary objective of EDA is to analyze the data for distribution outliers and anomalies in the dataset. First of all I will draw a heat map. Introduction to EDA Back to Table of Contents 0. Heat Map InterpretationFrom the above correlation heat map we can conclude that target and cp variable are mildly positively correlated correlation coefficient 0. Discover patterns and relationships between variables in the dataset. 1 Preview the dataset 6. Statistical properties of dataset Important points to note The above command df. Now we can see that the dataset contains 303 instances and 14 variables. Multivariate analysis Back to Table of Contents 0. Same is the case with several other variables fbs exang and target. 7 View column names 6. 1 EDA is generally cross classified in two ways. Below I will list some useful commands to deal with missing values. We can plot the bars horizontally as follows We can use a different color palette as follows We can use plt. Hence it is confirmed that there are no missing or negative values in the dataset. So we should check how each attribute correlates with the target variable. Pandas isnull and notnull functions Pandas offers two functions to test for missing data isnull and notnull. Univariate graphical EDAIn addition to finding the various sample statistics of univariate distribution discussed above we also look graphically at the distribution of the sample. Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally. I hope you learn and enjoy this kernel. Introduction to EDA 1 1. 3 Dataset description 6. It refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. Multivariate graphical EDAThere are several useful multivariate graphical EDA techniques which are used to look at the distribution of multivariate data. We can visualize the value counts of the cp variable wrt target as follows Interpretation We can see that the values of target variable are plotted wrt cp. I will visualize its frequency distribution of values as follows Visualize the frequency distribution of thalach variable Comment We can see that the thalach variable is slightly negatively skewed. 1 The objective of the multivariate analysis is to discover patterns and relationships in the dataset. Visualize the frequency distribution of cp variable Frequency distribution of target variable wrt cp Comment cp variable contains four integer values 0 1 2 and 3. I will check number of unique values in thalach variable as follows So number of unique values in thalach variable is 91. Analyze age and trestbps variableI will plot a scatterplot to visualize the relationship between age and trestbps variable. Exploratory Data Analysis Back to Table of Contents 0. Check the underlying assumptions in the dataset. I think it is more convinient way of interpret the plots. mean It returns percentage of missing values in each column in the dataframe. So I wll check relationships between these variables. 6 Statistical properties of dataset 6. There is no variable which has strong negative correlation with target variable. 1 Useful commands to detect missing values 10. If the column contains missing values then it returns TRUE otherwise FALSE. Its data type should be object. Out of 96 females 72 have heart disease and 24 do not have heart disease. 1 The following references are used to create this kernel Think Stats Exploratory Data Analysis in Python by Allen B Downey Seaborn API reference http seaborn. We can plot a histogram as follows Visualize frequency distribution of thalach variable wrt target Interpretation We can see that those people suffering from heart disease target 1 have relatively higher heart rate thalach as compared to people who are not suffering from heart disease target 0. There is no correlation between target and fbs. All the values are greater than or equal to zero. Interpretation The age variable distribution is approximately normal. As it contains only 0 and 1 as values so its data type is given as int64. The non graphical methods provide insight into the characteristics and the distribution of the variable s of interest. We can use an assert statement to programmatically check that no missing unexpected 0 or negative values are present. We can follow the same principles and visualize the target values distribution wrt fbs fasting blood sugar and exang exercise induced angina. So there are 165 patients suffering from heart disease. The minimum and maximum values of age are 29 and 77 years. target variable contains two integer values 1 and 0 1 Presence of heart disease 0 Absence of heart disease So the above analysis gives target variable values categorized into presence and absence of heart disease and groupby cp variable values. NaN NaN an acronym for Not a Number is a special floating point value recognized by all systems that use the standard IEEE floating point representation. any It checks whether a particular column has missing values or not. Interpretation The above scatter plot shows that there is no correlation between age and trestbps variable. If the cell contains missing value it returns True otherwise it returns False. Interpretation The above line shows that linear regression model is not good fit to the data. We can visualize this information below. 2 Summary of dataset 6. Analysis of target and cp variable Explore cp variable cp stands for chest pain type. It also provides tools for hypothesis generation by visualizing and understanding the data through graphical representation. sum The above command returns total number of missing values in each column in the dataframe. 1 Several questions come to mind when we come across a new dataset. Analyze age and chol variable Interpretation The above plot confirms that there is a slighly positive correlation between age and chol variables. 1 I will make boxplots to visualise outliers in the continuous numerical variables age trestbps chol thalach and oldpeak variables. html My other kernel https www. It includes analysing the data to find the distribution of data its main characteristics identifying patterns and visualizations. Check the number of unique values in target variableWe can see that there are 2 unique values in the target variable. When it is close to 0 it means that there is no correlation. Objectives of EDA 2 1. So non graphical methods involve calculation of summary statistics while graphical methods include summarizing the data diagrammatically. There are 165 patients suffering from heart disease and There are 138 patients who do not have any heart disease. When it is close to 1 this signifies that there is a strong positive correlation. So your upvote would be highly appreciated. describe include all View column names 7. We can add jitter to bring out the distribution of values as follows Visualize distribution of thalach variable wrt target with boxplot InterpretationThe above boxplot confirms our finding that people suffering from heart disease target 1 have relatively higher heart rate thalach as compared to people who are not suffering from heart disease target 0. I will use heat map and pair plot to discover the patterns and relationships in the dataset. sum It returns total number of missing values in the dataframe. 1 stands for presence of heart disease. We can see that the cp and thalach variables are mildly positively correlated with target variable. target variable contains two integer values 1 and 0 1 Presence of heart disease 0 Absence of heart disease The above plot confirms our above findings Alternatively we can visualize the same information as follows Analysis of target and thalach variable Explore thalach variable thalach stands for maximum heart rate achieved. InterpretationWe can see that there are no missing values in the dataset. isnull The above command checks whether each cell in a dataframe contains missing values or not. Preview the dataset Summary of dataset Dataset description The dataset contains several columns which are as follows age age in years sex 1 male 0 female cp chest pain type trestbps resting blood pressure in mm Hg on admission to the hospital chol serum cholestoral in mg dl fbs fasting blood sugar 120 mg dl 1 true 0 false restecg resting electrocardiographic results thalach maximum heart rate achieved exang exercise induced angina 1 yes 0 no oldpeak ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest slope the slope of the peak exercise ST segment ca number of major vessels 0 3 colored by flourosopy thal 3 normal 6 fixed defect 7 reversable defect target 1 or 0 Check the data types of columns The above df. I have imported the libraries. oldpeak variable contains outliers to the right side. com prashant111 comprehensive seaborn tutorial for beginners Go to Top 0. Univariate analysis Back to Table of Contents 0. Objectives of EDA Back to Table of Contents 0. fbs fasting blood sugar should be a character variable as it contains only 0 and 1 as values 1 true 0 false. Conclusion Back to Table of Contents 0. First I will check number of unique values in cp variable. We can write an assert statement to verify this. 1 So friends our EDA journey has come to an end. Hence it is numerical variable. Together CVD resulted in 17. Analysis of age and other variables Check the number of unique values in age variable View statistical summary of age variable Interpretation The mean value of the age variable is 54. There are different methods in place on how to detect missing values. Frequency distribution of target variable wrt sex Comment sex variable contains two integer values 1 and 0 1 male 0 female. Here age trestbps chol thalach and oldpeak are numerical variables and target is the categorical variable. 3 Findings of bivariate analysis 8. 1 Analysis of target feature variable Our feature variable of interest is target. target and thal variable are also waekly negatively correlated correlation coefficient 0. Import libraries Back to Table of Contents 0. 1 We can see that the input folder contains one input file named heart. exang exercise induced angina should also be a character variable as it contains only 0 and 1 as values 1 yes 0 no. In this kernel we have explored the heart disease dataset. 5 Important points about dataset 6. Similarly 0 stands for absence of heart disease. 4 Check data types of columns 6. Alternatively we can visualize the same information as follows Comment The above plot segregate the values of target variable and plot on two different columns labelled as sex 0 sex 1. target and oldpeak variable are also mildly negatively correlated correlation coefficient 0. Exploratory Data Analysis or EDA is a critical first step in analyzing a new dataset. 1 I will import the dataset with the usual pandas read_csv function which is used to import CSV Comma Separated Value files. We can do it as follows Interpretation of correlation coefficient The correlation coefficient ranges from 1 to 1. describe include object If we want to view the statistical properties of all the variables we should run the following command df. Check shape of the dataset It is a good idea to first check the shape of the dataset. 1 In Pandas missing data is represented by two values None None is a Python singleton object that is often used for missing data in Python code. I hope you like this kernel on EDA journey. Now I will view its frequency distribution as follows Comment It can be seen that cp is a categorical variable and it contains 4 types of values 0 1 2 and 3. We can visualize the value counts of the sex variable wrt target as follows Interpretation We can see that the values of target variable are plotted wrt sex 1 male 0 female.
