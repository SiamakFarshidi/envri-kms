TYPES OF SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT There are two main groups of Sequence Alignment Global sequence alignment we are interested in aligning the entire sequences Local sequence alignment we aim to find good alignments of adjacent nucleotides of both of the sequences whilst ignoring the rest div style color white display fill border radius 5px background color 3422A8 font size 220 font family Nexa letter spacing 0. The process of evolution is depicted in the form of an evolutionary tree bifurcations represent events of mutation from a common ancestor that gives rise to branches. Once the ribosome detects an initiation codon it starts the formation of the amino acid chain and when it scans the stop codon it stops the translation and detaches from the mRNA molecule. Given that a codon is composed of three nucleotides the mRNA sequence may have 3 possible interpretations. a standard sequence class various clustering modules a KD tree data structure etc. There are 20 types of amino acids used to form polypeptides for IUPAC less than the 64 possible codons therefore we have more than one codon corresponds to a type of amino acid. alphabet details you ll have to know the sequence type you are using so it makes sense to give them names accordingly. extract from the The list of SeqFeature objects. Lipids Part of the plasma membrane doing signaling and energy storage. There are formats used for saving loading alignments as well. We are looking at global alignment. org is quite popular so there are plenty of of examples http diverge. cycle through a list find the best alignment case. 3 TRANSLATION TRANSLATION CODON TABLES TRANSLATION Snipplet from genome. CODONS In each position of the triplet we have 1 4 nucleotides ie. org science ap biology gene expression and regulation translation a the genetic code discovery and properties The full set of relationships between codons and amino acids or stop signals is called the genetic code. Let s obtain the largest amino acid chain in the sequence data. cgi NCBIXML Code to work with the BLAST XML output. 3 BLAST PROTEIN SEQUENCE QUERY READING BLAST SEARCH RESULT CONTENT In Section 4. 3 we identified the longest amino acid chain in the genome in question let s search for it using BLAST. Each of the three primary databases have their own sequence file format layout. BIOPYTHON ABC 1 2 NUCLEIC ACIDS Among molecules with a biological role we can find nucleic acids. START STOP CODONS Some of these codons represent significant signals that indicate the initiation or the termination of the translation process. STEP 2 PROTEIN SYNTHESIS TRANSLATION Translation process in which the nucleotide sequence of the mRNA is transcribed into a chain of amino acids forming a polypeptide. BioPython is a very convenient tool we can utlise when working with Sequences Alignments of DNA Protein based sequences. Similarly Guanine G bonds only with Cytosine C nucleotides by three hydrogen connections. Let s define some basic annotations for SeqRec below which we can subsequently save using SeqIO using the minimalistic FASTA or detailed Genbank formats. 5 NOTEBOOK AIM In this notebook we ll be covering very simple beginner entry operations one can encounter when starting out in the field of bioinformatics. READING SINGLE SEQUENCE FILES The FASTA format can actually contain multiple sequences in one file we need to read them slightly differently. that have resistence measure list of nucleotides list of unitigs List of nucleotides list of unitigs Select one unitig in lst1 and find the best alignment in lst2 remove cases if columns exist in string main unitig used for comparison Cycle through all unitigs in updated list String format of alignment Sequence Class instances Create a sequence record w a defined ID Multiple Sequence Alignment Get the 2nd sequence in the alignment Get the 3rd column in the alignment Get multiple columns in alignment first 3 columns of seq1 sequences 2 and 3 4th to 10th column Get the length of the alignment column size Print the SeqRecord data adjust alignment content write if need be Write the read clustal formal Or directly convert it make sequence and id lists from the aln object creates a 2D grid of coords from the 1D arrays flattens the arrays use recty for rect coords with an offset now we can create the ColumnDataSource with all the arrays view_range is for the close up view sequence text view with ability to scroll along x axis lod_factor 1 Mapping Function for nucleotide sequences File which we want to align Description is included so we can compare results BLAST query instance Read the file call only once display only perfect matches show only 5 results go through all blast records fetch the id description evalue bitscore alignment read file read qblast result show first hit only Recall Alignment Recall Alignment From raw MSE alignment The identity model can be used both for DNA and protein sequences create calculator get the distance matrix of a given alignment object nj upgma tree construction approaches initialise main algorithm Plot Tree sub_alin2 kaggle working sub_alin2. amino acids and nucleotides 23 macro molecules proteins lipids polysaccharides According to their internal structure they can be divided into to major categories Prokaryotic cells have no nucleus or internal membranes. 2 SEQUENCE DEFINITION div style color white display fill border radius 5px background color 3422A8 font size 220 font family Nexa letter spacing 0. Whilst it can be interesting to work with your own classes you can modify to your needs it s much easier and less of a hastle to work in BioPython. If we wanted to do multiple sequence alignment we have to define each individual sequences in the SeqRecord object which requires just the id to be defined. fasta create calculator get the distance matrix of a given alignment object initialise main algorithm Recall Alignment Plot Tree. Each mRNA molecule can be scanned multiple times by different ribosomes giving rise to multiple copies of the polypeptide. localXY OPTIONS IN FOR X Y The first X indicates __a substitution matrix__ or __the parameters for match missmatches__ The second Y indicates the parameters for the penalty of the gap. Phylo allows us to understand the relation between difference aligned sequences Phylogenetic analysis analysis concerned with determining how a given set of sequences alignment has evolved from a common ancestor through the process of natural evolution. If two sequences show high degree of similarity score then they have a high chance of being __homologous__ sharing similar functions. 1 STRING TO SEQ SMALLER SEQUENCES When a sequence are quite short eg. The genetic code describes the relationship between the sequence of base pairs in a gene and the corresponding amino acid sequence that it encodes. Eukaryotic cells which have a defined nucleus internal membranes and functional elements called organelles. Alignment Type option is written after pairwise2. when we are looking at part of the entire DNA sequence we can probably just define them using the string format. 2 TREE VISUALISATION nucleotide sequence protein sequence possible not actually possible As we can see FASTA doesn t seem to save the annotations data annotations Whereas Genbank does annotations Define locations exact location fuzzy location range define the feature location Example for a gene feature location shorter the specified type of the feature 1 indicates the minus strand reverse_complement If we wanted to extract the feature We can of course write to gb file see our stored data annotations define one of the features from the list Extracted feature nuceotide seq Print fasta file information number of nucleotides Extract Sequence some files contain just the basic details protein seq returns an interator GenBank format are more comprehnsive than fasta. The format originates from the FASTA software package but has now become a near universal standard in the field of bioinformatics. 4 UNITIG SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT FINDING THE BEST ALIGNMENT IN A LIST We can utilise pairwise2. Thus we cannot simply rely on a comparison of nucleotides that are __in the same order__. parse we can also use SearchIO to read our BLAST XML query results. qblast query search in the pdb database. 8 PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS SEQUENCE EVOLUTION One of the more practical modules applications in BioPython Bio. More detailed information about the SeqFeature class BioPython Documentation https biopython. org wiki FASTA_format In bioinformatics and biochemistry the FASTA format is a text based format for representing either nucleotide sequences or amino acid protein sequences in which nucleotides or amino acids are represented using single letter codes. SEQRECORD FEATURES Real sequences can be very long contain useful subset sequences that one might be interested in. SeqRecord is class we d use when we want to work with Seq that have more information about the sequence grouped all in one spot. 2 TRANSCRIPTION REVERSE COMPLEMENT TRANSCRIPTIONThe process of transcription from DNA to RNA is a critical step in the process of protein synthesis I Process that occurs within the nucleus of a cell we obtain a __Mature messenger RNA mRNA. These three ways of parsing the sequence are called reading frames. Like FASTA GenBank files can store more than one sequence are read in exactly the same way as shown above using class SeqIO. For Proteins we ll need to use blastp in our NCBIWWW. The existence of these two strands is essential in order to pass on genetic information to new cells and produce proteins. ANNOTATION CONTENT We can visualise the annotation content if it is present using. CODON TABLES A codon is a sequence of three DNA RNA nucleotides that corresponds with a specific amino acid or stop signal codon during protein synthesisSnipplet from Khan Academy https www. As a result we need to resort to a procedure known as Pairwise Sequence Alignment PSA. GLOBAL PROTEIN SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT Let s try another example aligning pseq1 pseq2 both are protein sequences. Exploring these genes we can get their locus tag from qualifiers database reference from qualifiers strand location. 4 SEQUENCE PROCESSING div style color white display fill border radius 5px background color 3422A8 font size 220 font family Nexa letter spacing 0. 1 BASIC SEQUENCE PROCESSING OPERATIONSBiopython uses Python strings so the standard string operations can be used. and even documentation. BLAST QUERY SAVING CONTENT Our sequence let s say we didn t know the NBCI gi identifier is made up of nucleotide content so we ll use blastn option when calling. 2 MultipleSeqAlignment PUTTING IT TOGETHER Upon defining the sequence records of all the sequences we want to align we can call MultipleSeqAlignment with the records as inputs. The genetic code is often summarized in a table. Additional steps of RNA processing including stabilising elements at the end of the molecule are performed by different protein complexes. org wiki SeqRecord SeqRecord objects are used in Biopython to hold a sequence as a Seq object with identifiers ID and name description and optionally annotation and sub features. REVERSE COMPLEMENT DNA has two complementary strands. Translation accepts a DNA sequence and converts it into a proteins in the reading frame you specify. USEFUL MATERIAL www PHYLOGENETIC TREES LECTURE https www. In eukaryotic cells DNA will be found in the nucleus whilst in the prokaryotic cells it will be found in the cytoplasm. Nucleotide sequence of a gene from one of the DNA strands is transcribed copied into a compelentary molecule of RNA Complementarity of code allows us to recover information contained in the DNA sequence process performed by an enzyme RNA polymerase. The primary structure is defined by the chain of amino acids polypeptide consisting in part or completely of protein. gov genetics glossary Translation Translation is the process of translating the sequence of a messenger RNA mRNA molecule to a sequence of amino acids during protein synthesis. Instead of using NCBIXML. org wiki PAML www WORKING WITH PHYLOGENETIC TREES https biopython. SHOWING FEATURES CONTENT If there are any features present in the file we can get the list by calling. __ II mRNA is then transfered to the cytoplasm where it will be used by a cellular machine to guide the production of a protein. 1 SIMILAR SEQUENCES GENERATING A HYPOTHESIS We can generate a hypothesis about the biological function based on sequence similarity. Basic Local Alignment Search Tool BLAST uses the same alignment methods as implemented in Biopython except the comparison sequences are called from a database. There are a couple of approaches used to construct a phylogenetic tree Distance Matrix based implemented in biopython Parsimony implemented in biopython Maximum Likelihood based Accessable via external library wrapper EXTERNAL LIBRARY WRAPPERS Bio. Stabilisation of elements at the end of a molecule are perfomed by different protein complexes. b Chemical function Being involved in chemical reactions occuring in the cell. If __m__ is provided the function will allow us to define a match mismatch score using appropriate parameters. If __d__ is provided we can pass on a dictionary to the function defining a full substitution matrix. Some more specifics second letter If __x__ is provided no gap penalties are imposed g 0 If __s__ is provided we can define an affinite gap penalty model SEQUENCE INPUT SEQUENCES Inputs can be both string formats or defined Seq class instances. 1 SeqRecord FOR ALIGNMENT SEQUENCES We looked at SeqRecord earlier a sequence read from a file is already in this format so we can instantly pass them to the alignment class. com f 8cc1eeaa 4046 4c4a ae93 93d656f68688 detodgt 0c9ae2b8 3e64 4876 86d9 5ff3b38de5ff. 3 READING SEQUENCE FILES div style color white display fill border radius 5px background color 3422A8 font size 220 font family Nexa letter spacing 0. 5 PAIRWISE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT div style color white display fill border radius 5px background color 3422A8 font size 220 font family Nexa letter spacing 0. SIMPLE SEQUENCE OPERATION Since we don t have. 3 ALIGNMENT FORMATS DEFINING AN ALIGNMENT Usually alignments are generated by MultipleSeqAlignment however we can create a blank alignment by passing a blank list to MSA. PhymlCommandline Bio. sequence alignment we need to create an instance of the Seq class for each sequence. We can for example cycling through all features get all the annotated genes in the whole sequence. gov CBBresearch Przytycka download lectures PCB_Lect11_Phylogen_Trees. In the cell cytoplasm the ribosome reads the sequence of the mRNA in groups of three bases to assemble the protein. 3 CENTRAL DOGMA OF MOLECULAR CELL BIOLOGY DNA RNA Proteins are the central elements of the flow of genetic information that occurs in two steps 1 transcription 2 translation. BioPython also includes a BLAST module that can be used to search for similar sequences like we did in Section 4 5 Bio. For each codon in the mRNA sequence we have a corresponding amino acid in the polypeptide chain. It is well documented https biopython. Formats similar to Genbank have been developed by ENA EMBL format and by DDBJ DDBJ format. pairwise2 has implementations of Dynamic Programing DP Algorithms for __Pairwise Sequence Alignment__. It has become a standard to describe the DNA though only one of the strands due to this complementarity using A T G C. align in a variety of situations eg. In this case we can see that the alignment is not ideal at all resulting in lots of gaps for the input sequence the best alignment score is due to the longer matching sequence size. pairwise2 we can t use direct strings in the alignment class input need to define a Seq object for a particular sequence followed by a defined SeqRecord instance that has its defined sequence ID. global with a match score of 1 missmatch score of 0 so first letter is x no gap penalty emposed second letter is x. 2 NUCLEIC ACIDS COMPLEMENTARY STRANDS IN DNA DNA is a molecule composed of two complementary strands that form and stick together due to the connections established between the nucleotides in both strands. We ll look at which annotations data are typically added in Section 3 where we ll load and look at real sequence files. This process is even more complicated by nucleotide insertions deletions. In BioPython we can use SeqRecord objects with our defined Seq object instances add define additional information about our sequence s. X is replaced by the type. READING ALIGNMENT DATA As with the previously mentioned FASTA GENBANK formats in SeqIO. 2 BLAST NUCLEOTIDE SEQUENCE QUERY LOADING THE SEQUENCE We ll use a FASTA file whos description contains the actual sequence identification so we ll be able to see if we have a hit in the database of existing sequences. qblast The query can be saved to a file as we would with a normal python file. During the translation process A type of small RNA molecule transfer RNA tRNAs will bring to the ribosome the amino acids of the corresponding type which will be complementary to the mRNA codon that is currently being scanned. Being a dictionary we can get see what sort annotations are present by calling. https images wixmp ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2. div style color white display fill border radius 5px background color 3422A8 font size 220 font family Nexa letter spacing 0. Nucleic acids encode and express the genetic code that is kept within the cell. ISSUES IN COMPARING SEQUENCES If we try to compare sequences one by one we might run into issues since Two similar sequences often have gone through biological mutation which can change nucleotides thus changing their structure. EXPLORING THE GENE FEATURE TYPE One of the features.

In order to function as expected a protein needs to acquire the appropriate structure this structure is often decomposed at different complexity levels. SIMPLE OR COMPLEX FORMAT FASTA is quite a generic format can be used to store multiple sequences even alignments as well. 2 BIOPYTHON SPECIFICS CHOOSING THE TYPE OF ALIGNMENT Bio.

To use some operations with this sequence in biopython eg. read is used for reading single sequence files else we get an error More than one record found in handle. The format also allows for sequence names and comments to precede the sequences. com nwheeler443 gono unitigs dataset we can compare a sequence from one list and try to find the the best alignment in the second list. We can also add new sequences by using. 1 NCBI DATABASE ONLINE QUERIES USING DATABASES TO UNDERSTAND OUR SEQUENCE There are are ways to do Sequence Alignment via websites like ebi. org wiki AlignIO clustal is one of such formats is often used. BIOPYTHON BLAST CLASSES NCBIWWW Code to invoke the NCBI BLAST server over the internet uses nih. 1 COMMON FORMATS TWO MAIN FORMATS Two formats are commonly used for sequence storage introduced in the previous section. parse is used for reading multiple sequence files which returns an iterator that can be used to cycle through and get the sequences. 3 to try to find the proteins that the gene feature encode EXPLORING CDS FEATURE TYPE Another.

Carbohydrates Serve as energy storage both for immediate and long term energy demands. After these steps which occur within the nucleus of the cell an RNA molecule mature messenger RNA mRNA is obtained. protein however this is not necessary in recent versions. BIOPYTHON S AIM Basically the goal of Biopython is to make it as easy as possible to use Python for bioinformatics by creating high quality reusable modules and classes. 2 SEQUENCE ANNOTATION OBJECTS DEFINING MORE DETAIL ABOUT OUR SEQUENCE Sequence files obtained from databases provied the option to for more detailed information storage about the sequence not just the sequence alone. What performs this This process is performed by the ribosomes that attach and scan the mRNA from one end to the other in groups of nucleotide triplets Codons. The content is saved using. This is made possible by due to the chemical phenomenon where Adenine A bonds only with Thymine T nucleotides as a result of two hydrogen connections. Python is an object oriented interpreted flexible language that is becoming increasingly popular for scientific computing. As indicated in the AlignIO section https biopython. uk Tools sss which uses an approach called BLAST. STEP 1 RNA SYNTHESIS TRANSCRIPTION Transcription Preliminary step required to produce a protein The nucleotide sequence of a gene from one of the DNA strands is transcribed copied into a complementary molecule of RNA The complementarity of the genetic code allows recovering the information encoded in the original DNA sequence a process performed by the enzyme RNA polymerase. Feature descriptions can be quite useful if we want to define subsets of the sequence to which a feature is applicable. FASTA is definitely less detailed very minimalistic when it comes to content usually only containing a description sequence. features What we defined in Section 2. store sequence Annotations Features annotations field dic that provides a number of properties for the seq Getting specific key values show only a few features total 41 Gene Qualifiers list of protein sequences ordered dictionary Should be identical Counter for Guanine Nucleotide Count Show specific Subset of a Sequence Is string subset part of sequence Find Substring index Instantiate a sequence w Seq Let s take a look at one type of table SGC Getting a specific conversion translate codon into an aminoacid Translate DNA sequence using two different tables SGC Vertebrate Mitochondrial Load our sequence apply translate functional proteins are chains above 20 amino acids.

Python is easy to learn has a very clear syntax and can easily be extended with modules written in C C or FORTRAN. read and saved with the xml extension. 1 TREE CONSTRUCTION BIOPYTHONS IMPLEMENTATION Bio. parse which returns the Record objects which we can read through using for loops. CONVERTING FORMATS FASTA is quite a generic format which aside from storing sequence data which we saw above can also store alignment data. org wiki PhyloL www PHYLOGENETIC COOKBOOK https biopython. nr nt pdb The sequence to be used in the query can search by the gi identifier if you have it div style color white display fill border radius 5px background color 3422A8 font size 220 font family Nexa letter spacing 0. org DIST docs tutorial Tutorial. com nwheeler443 understanding phylogenetic trees notebook 7 BLAST div style color white display fill border radius 5px background color 3422A8 font size 220 font family Nexa letter spacing 0. We can also do simple operations on these sequences as they are grouped together as they are essentially strings in alignment. Two commonly added detailed information about a sequence Annotations Extra metadata information about the sequence Features Extra information about the sequence content which is extractable SEQRECORD CLASS CONTENTSeqRecord BioPython https biopython. With its redundency where more than one codon encodes an amino acid the genetic code encloses a very efficient code correction mechanism that minimises the impact of errors in the nucleotide sequence occuring in DNA replication.
