The output of each mask by naive HPA Cell Segmentation for comparison is temp test_mask_original ID _cell. Setup Faster HPA Cell Segmentation Code Run and Execution Time Original Code Run and Execution Time Comparing Images Faster HPA Cell Segmentation Overlay Original Overlay Faster HPA Cell Segmentation Mask Only Original Mask Only a bytes object dt for hpa_image to remove the small pseduo nuclei this is to remove the cell borders signal from cell mask. resize cell_image 512 512 ax i. In order to properly post process the resized image I have adjusted some parameters in the post processing code to 0. Tuned for segmentation hpa images exclude the green area first this part is to use green channel and extend cell label to green channel benefit is to exclude cells clear on border but without nucleus cell_image cv2. By default the NN model of HPA Cell Segmentation processes 0. For parameters related to area I adjusted them by a factor of 1 16. to experiment with a small amount of data during debugging. npy temp test_mask ID _nuc. logical_and with some revision to replace this func. About This CodeThe following code writes the code to a Python file and starts it in a separate process to simplify memory management. Therefore it is inefficient to perform post processing on the restored image 2048x2048. The input to be processed is. Faseter HPA Cell SegmentationThe execution time of HPA Cell Segmentation seems to use a lot of time for post processing.
