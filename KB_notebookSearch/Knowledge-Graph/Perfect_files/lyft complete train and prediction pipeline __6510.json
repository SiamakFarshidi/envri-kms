In this notebook I present an end to end train and prediction pipeline to predict vehicle motions with a pretrained model included. com lyft l5kit tree master examples agent_motion_prediction and the following kernels Lyft Training with multi mode confidence https www. More information about the loss function can be found here negative log likelihood https github. Training loopNext let us implement the training loop when the train parameter is set to True. If you don t have a pretrained model and want to train from scratch put weight_path False. It is much faster to do this rather than pip install l5kit every time you run the notebook. Note that this model will return three possible trajectories together with confidence score for each trajectory. without any ensemeble which should only be done near the end of the competition. Loss functionFor this competition it is important to use the correct loss function when train the model.

Let me know your suggestions in the comments below. Unfortunately because of Kaggle memory constraint we can only either run the train part or the prediction part by toggling the parameters in the config part.

Unfortunately due to Kaggle memory constraint if train True then you should put predict False.

However the training time will be significantly longer. predict True if you want to predict and submit to Kaggle. batch_size number of inputs for one forward pass again one of the parameters to tune. Note that since the pretrained model was trained on GPU you also need to enable GPU when running this notebook. max_num_steps the number of iterations to train i. com corochann Lyft Comprehensive guide to start competition https www. com corochann lyft prediction with multi mode confidence which is part of a wonderful series of introductory notebooks by corochann https www. com corochann lyft prediction with multi mode confidence Note This notebook aims to create the best single possible i.

If successful you can see usr lib lyft l5kit unofficial fix is added to the Data section of this kernel page on right side of the kernel.

Now let us initialize the model and load the pretrained weights. Unfortunately due to Kaggle memory constraint if you want to predict then you need to put train False. Some of the code here are taken from the tutorial notebook https github. com corochann lyft deep into the l5kit library Save your time submit without kernel inference https www. For the pretrained model we use resnet18 so we need to use resnet18 in the config. Increase raster_size can improve the score. py assert all data are valid convert to batch_size num_modes future_len num_coords add modes add modes and cords error batch_size num_modes future_len reduce coords and use availability when confidence is 0 log goes to inf but we re fine with it error batch_size num_modes reduce time use max aggregator on modes for numerical stability error batch_size num_modes error are negative at this point so max gives the minimum one reduce modes print error error pred bs x time x 2D coords bs x mode 1 x time x 2D coords create confidence bs x mode 1 This is 512 for resnet18 and resnet34 And it is 2048 for the other resnets X Y coords for the future positions output shape batch_sizex50x2 You can add more layers here.

ConfigsCouple of things to note model_architecture you can put resnet18 resnet34 or resnet50. Our goal is to predict three possible paths together with the confidence score so we need to use the loss function that takes that into account simply using RMSE will not lead to an accurate model.
