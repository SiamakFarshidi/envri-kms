In this summary width height ratios of around 2 seems to work best. Check cropped train images Check cropped test images Image analysis functionImage width and height are swapped if height width for orginal versions as well as cropped versions. Credits I adapted the crop function from https www. Some statistics to choose the input resolution for your InChI predictorAnalysis of train and test images random sample in the Bristol Myers Squibb Molecular Translation Competition https www. I did this analysis to learn more about the images we are given especially after they are cropped. com markwijkhuizen advanced image cleaning and tfrecord generation great TFRecord kernel Hi everyone I ve seen different choices of the image resolution and w h ratio so far some use squares some rectangles. What ratio and image resolution did you choose as input for your InChI prediction model What were the reasons Feel free to comment below and or leave a vote if you find this kernel helpful Adapted crop functionThe crop function from the original source above was adapted to ignore noise pixels and thus crop the real molecule structure only without removing the noise first. Train image statistics Test image statistics Images with extremly low width or heightThere are some images with extremly low height after cropping. com c bms molecular translation to find a suitable input image ratio and resolution. Find best input resolution sorting again after sampling seems to make the file access slightly faster for large IMAGE_NUM idea pad with contour_min_size pixels just in case we cut off a small part of the structure that is separated by a missing pixel rotate counter clockwise to get horizontal images ignore contours under contour_min_size pixels collect position of small contours starting with contour_min_size pixels enlarge the found crop box if it cuts out small stuff that is very close by make sure we get the crop within a valid range 255 need for cropping to work mean shrink factor largest of the two factors to decrease image width and or height to fit the image into the input size 1 if image fits already root mean square. Checking if crop function made a mistake. Note that image width and height are swapped if height width for orginal versions as well as cropped versions.
