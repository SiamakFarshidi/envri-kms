For color images there is a third dimension which encodes the channel e. Basically we walk through the array and when we find a pixel that is part of the mask we index it and count how many subsequent pixels are also part of the mask. To make things simpler for this first pass we can coerce all these images into grayscale using the rgb2gray function from scikit image. com gaborvecsei basic pure computer vision segmentation lb 0 229. One thing we can do here is to see whether we can shrink the mask to open up the differences between the cells. If we found the best separation value we could mask out the background data then simply count the objects we re left with. We repeat this each time we see new pixel start point. I ll keep updating this notebook to try and improve it user Gabro Vecsei takes a similar approach and scores 0. Under this assumption we would expect the data to fall into a bimodal distribution of intensities. find_objects returns a list of the coordinate range for each labeled object in your image. This is called mask erosion. Dealing with colorThe images in this dataset can be in RGB RGBA and grayscale format based on the modality in which they are acquired. I found a nice function to do RLE from Kaggle user Rakhlin s kernel https www. A quick glance reveals two problems in this very simple image There are a few individual pixels that stand alone e. But there are other methods the Otsu method is useful because it models the image as a bimodal distribution and finds the optimal separation value. com rakhlin fast run length encoding python which I ve copied here. We also create a wrapper function that will spit out a single DataFrame for all images in the dataset. The dumbest way we could find the threshold value would be to use a simple descriptive statistic such as the mean or median. find_objects we can iterate through our masks zooming in on the individual nuclei found to apply additional processing steps. Combine it into a single functionNow that we ve seen the basic steps to processing an image in a dumb way we can combine it all into a single function. Deriving individual masks for each objectFor this contest we need to get a separate mask for each nucleus. We can then re dilate it to to recover the original proportions. My main intention here though is to help out people who are new to analyses not to score highly. Label 2 has the adjacent cell problem the two cells are being considered part of the same object. Glob the training data and load a single image path Print the image dimensions Coerce the image into grayscale format if not already Now let s plot the data Make sure the larger portion of the mask is considered background Create a random colormap Check if the label size is too small Regenerate the labels Get the object indices and perform a binary opening procedure. This kernel will implement classical image techniques and will hopefully serve as a useful primer to people who have never worked with image data before. Then we can loop through each label_id and add it to an iterable such as a list. Removing backgroundPerhaps the simplest approach for this problem is to assume that there are two classes in the image objects of interest and the background. This function will take an image path perform the processes outlined above and spit out a dataframe with the RLE strings for each mask found. 22 in this kernel https www. T sets Fortran order down then right Read in data and convert to grayscale Mask out background and extract connected objects Loop through labels and add each to a DataFrame. Ultimately we will develop a simple pipeline using scipy and numpy and a little bit of scikit image that we can apply to the test images in fact we won t even use the training images except to optimize parameters. One way we can do this is by looking for all objects in the mask that are connected and assign each of them a number using ndimage.
