Group is nominal variable so appling one hot encoding. Above graphs concludes following 1. Analysis result How effective is the test preparation course It plays major role in result and helps to score better grade. Also if possible parent should also educate themself so that they can help the student with thier studies whenever they require. There s no outliers in score as all values are in the range of 0 100. From above we can conclude that linear regression and support vector MSE is less but it not good model as it ll always predict the value in range of 50 80 therefoere Randonforest can be consider as best model for this dataset. gender lunch and test preparation course are binay columns so simply converted in 0 and 1 values. Problem Statement Predict the student s performance in exam Type Regression Supervised Machine learning This data set includes scores from three exams and a variety of personal social and economic factors that have interaction effects upon students. Studeds having standard lunch and conpleted test preparation course gets good grade in examination. Above graphs shows that score 40 can be deciding score to state student is pass or fail. The task is to find following 1. Now grade can be allocated as follow A above 90B 80 89C 70 79D 55 69E 40 54F below 40 score in any subject Data analysisFrom above graphs we can conclude the followings 1. Test preparation course helps a lot to student to pass the examination. Grades are require to measure students performance in exam. Which major factors contribute to test outcomes Lunch test preparation course and parents education are major factors. How effective is the test preparation course 2. Percdentage needs to calculate to allocate grade. All features are categorical. Handling categorical variable1. Parent s education level also plays major role in students result. What would be the best way to improve student scores on each test If student get standard lunch and completed test preparation course will help student to score better in exam. Also if parents have degree or master level education then studens perfoms well in examination. What would be the best way to improve student scores on each test Importing require libraries Importing dataset Checking duplicate valuesDataset do not have any duplicate values Checking data info Observations 1. Dataset do not have any null values. Train Test split Model Selection Above plot shows that model is predicting quite good for value between range of 50 80 as majority of data lies in that range but it is performing worst for other values. Which major factors contribute to test outcomes 3.
