In order to use the IFN inducing ability of CFP antigens in this study they evaluated a prime boost heterologous immunization based on CFP CpG to boost Mycobacterium bovis BCG vaccination in order to find an immunization schedule that could induce protection. They did not observe protection when these mice were challenged with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. input directory For example running this by clicking run or pressing Shift Enter will list all files under the input directory You can write up to 20GB to the current directory kaggle working that gets preserved as output when you create a version using Save Run All You can also write temporary files to kaggle temp but they won t be saved outside of the current session Import Python Packages PyTesseract and Tika Python for OCR Define helper function for plotting word clouds adapted from https www. com taha07 data scientists jobs analysis visualization notebook Code by Olga Belitskaya https www. com taha07 data scientists jobs analysis visualization notebook Use hole to create a donut like pie chart Count Plot Code by Taha07 https www. read_csv Input data files are available in the read only. Separate data in folds create train and validation dataframes train the model and cauculate the mean AUC. Heterologous BCG CFP CpG immunization provided significant protection against experimental tuberculosis and this protection was sustained during the late phase of infection and was even better than that conferred by a single BCG immunization. At 30 A or 70 B days after infection the lungs were processed for the CFU assay and histopathological analysis. com kaggle docker python For example here s several helpful packages to load linear algebra data processing CSV file I O e. The deleterious role of IL 4 was confirmed when IL 4 knockout mice vaccinated with CFP CpG showed consistent protection similar to that elicited by BCG CFP CpG heterologous immunization. The protection was associated with high levels of antigen specific IFN and interleukin 17 IL 17 and low IL 4 production. Bacterial load is expressed as log10 CFU g of lung from the means standard deviations of serial dilutions individually counted for each group. 05 versus nonimmunized infected mice MTB group P 0. Have you Bacille Calmette Gu\u00e9rin BCG remains the only effective vaccine against disseminated TB but its inability to confer complete protection against pulmonary TB in adolescents and adults calls for an urgent need to develop new and better vaccines. com benhamner most common forum topic words Define helper function for plotting word bar graphs adapted from https www. BALB c mice n 8 to 10 were immunized subcutaneously with a single dose of BCG BCG group three doses of CFP CpG CFP CpG group at 7 day intervals one dose of BCG followed by one dose of CFP CpG after 15 days BCG CFP CpG group or one dose of CFP CpG followed by one dose of BCG after 15 days CFP CpG BCG group.

Moreover different immunological parameters such as IFN and IL 17 and tightly regulated IL 4 secretion seem to contribute to the efficacy of this tuberculosis vaccine. There is also a need to identify markers of disease protection and develop novel drugs. These findings show that a single dose of CFP CpG can represent a new strategy to boost the protection conferred by BCG vaccination. Sixty days after vaccination mice were challenged with a virulent strain of M.
