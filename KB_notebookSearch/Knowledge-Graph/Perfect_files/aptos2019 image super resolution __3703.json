Docker scripts and Google Colab notebooks are available to carry training and prediction. The implemented networks include The super scaling Residual Dense Network described in Residual Dense Network for Image Super Resolution https arxiv. APTOS 2019 Image Super Resolution https github. So that s the goal of this kernel _Improving Diabetic Retinopathy images using free and open source tools _The process will be 1. Compare the results with the original ones What is exactly Image Super Resolution project ISR Image https idealo. Start from a low resolution images 2. com idealo image super resolution One of my first thoughts in this competition was to undertand the quality of the given images. io image super resolution figures butterfly. com idealo image super resolution project 3. He and his team realized this amazing open source project that can be applied to many domains Here is the full team Francesco Cardinale github cfrancesco https github. However I guess many laboratories can t have the same tools and most probably there are many hospitals around the world that can t afford taking those high quality images. com valiantone Dat Tran github datitran https github. 2018 A multi output version of the Keras VGG19 network for deep features extraction used in the perceptual loss A custom discriminator network based on the one described in Photo Realistic Single Image Super Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial Network https arxiv. ISR is compatible with Python 3. We welcome any kind of contribution. 04802 SRGANS Ledig et al. xD libraries Firstly We are going so resize the images to Low Resolution. 6 and is distributed under the Apache 2. Arch https idealo. 2018 The super scaling Residual in Residual Dense Network described in ESRGAN Enhanced Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks https arxiv. My first aim with this kernel was to improve images quality to make better prediction but after a few days I realized that I couldn t take much advantage as predictive power from this process. Also we provide scripts to facilitate training on the cloud with AWS and nvidia docker with only a few commands. This project contains Keras implementations of different Residual Dense Networks for Single Image Super Resolution ISR as well as scripts to train these networks using content and adversarial loss components. com datitran 2019 Competition Image 2015 Competition Image Install ISR ConclusionsWe can easily notice the differences between the processed images and the resized ones. If you wish to contribute please see the Contribute section. io image super resolution figures RRDN. com cfrancesco Zubin John github valiantone https github. Increase their resolution with Image Super Resolution ISR https github. For instance the outlines and veins details improved significantly What do you think Could it be useful for hospitals and labs to save in super expensive machinery I would love to discuss further in comments If you enjoyed the kernel please consider upvoting it. jpg _NOTE _I Discovered this project following Dat Tran https www. That s because the images resolution is already pretty high and when we process them we usually reduce it around 256x256. Let s say 200x200 Then we apply ISR and see the results I m going to take just 2 images new and old competition and work on them import model This is to compare to the images created with ISR so we can better see differences.
