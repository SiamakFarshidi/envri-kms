To date it contains 2 480 benign and 5 429 malignant samples 700X460 pixels 3 channel RGB 8 bit depth in each channel PNG format. DatasetThe Breast Cancer Histopathological Image Classification BreakHis is composed of 9 109 microscopic images of breast tumor tissue collected from 82 patients using different magnifying factors 40X 100X 200X and 400X. jpg https pathology. Microscopic evaluation of histopathalogic stained tissue its subsequent digitalisation is now a more feasible due to the advances in slide scanning technology as well a reduction in digital storage cost in recent years. SLN assessment is tedious and time consuming.

This could result in a significant reduction in the workload of pathologists. Early accurate diagnosis plays an important role in choosing the right treatment plan and improving survival rate among the patients. Breast Cancer Histopathology Images Classification https pathology. ChallengesThe sensitivity of SLN assessment by pathologists however is not optimal. edu build assets breast _gallery invasive lobular carcinoma. This database has been built in collaboration with the P D Laboratory Pathological Anatomy and Cytopathology Parana Brazil http www. There are certain advantages that come with such digitalised pathology including remote diagnosis instant archival access simplified procedure of consultations with expert pathologists. jpg IntroductionBreast cancer is a common cancer in women and one of the major causes of death among women around the world with 627 000 deaths among 2. Digitalised Analysis based on Deep Learning has shown potential benefits as a potential diagnosis tool strategy. A retrospective study showed that pathology review by experts changed the nodal status in 24 of patients. Invasive ductal carcinoma IDC is the most widespread type of breast cancer with about 80 of all diagnosed cases. 1 million diagnosed cases in 2018. We believe that researchers will find this database a useful tool since it makes future benchmarking and evaluation possible.
