We can see the lowest resolution are probably far too small to interpret meaningfully. Comparing ModelsWe look at a number of different standard models for classifying the tiles KNearestNeighbors LogisticRegression RandomForest These give us a baseline for what we expect models to be able to do with these images a few utility functions for showing MNIST style images easily.
