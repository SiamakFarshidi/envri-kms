Most of the modern training frameworks SimCLR BYOL MoCo V2 in this area make use of a self supervised model pre trained with some contrastive learning objective. com RisingSayak minimally implemented this paper in TensorFlow.

Check out the Effect on CV Score A Comparative Study section below to see the details. create crop entries with same shape. download This is a minimal implementation of the technique. TL DREven though the top 1 accuracy of ResNet 50 is better than SwAV pre trained ResNet 50 the CV score is 5 better. get embedding of same dim views together for first iter concat all the embeddings from all the views get normalized projection and prototype swav loss. com facebookresearch swav Minimal TensorFlow Implementation https github. Get predictions using KNN. It would be interesting to see if SwAV training methodology of cluster assignment is improving the CV score or not. 09882 The authors of this paper investigated a question Can we learn a meaningful metric that reflects apparent similarity among instances via pure discriminative learning To answer this they devised a novel unsupervised feature learning algorithm called instance level discrimination. Imports and SetupsVisit https wandb. Here each image and its transformations views are treated as two separate instances. I have trained this model on a GCP instance and I have saved the weights of the same as W B artifacts. v1 Introduction to SwAV pretraining. gif Using Weights and BiasesI have used W B to keep track of the experiments and to save the trained models as artifacts.

You will require an account https wandb. You might want to lower the resolution of the cropped images by changing this parameter SIZE_CROPS you can also change the number of views generated by changing this NUM_CROPS. png Figure 1 Top 1 accuracy of linear classifiers trained with the frozen features of different self supervised methods w. Fortunately the authors of the SwAV paper have provided us with the pretrained weights. png Figure 2 Performance of different semi supervised and self supervised frameworks on fine tuning with very little labeled data.

The aim is to learn an embedding mapping x image to v feature such that semantically similar instances images are closer in the embedding space. 09882 How can SwAV be helpful in this competition Many fellow Kagglers are using pretrained image classifier with ARC Face loss function. initialize wandb train Serialize the models Read CSV file. 09882 W B Report https wandb. t the fully supervised methods. png Read Data Get Image Embeddings And Get Predictions Compute CV ScoreThat s amazing Even though the top 1 accuracy of ResNet 50 is better than SwAV pre trained ResNet 50 the CV score is 5 better. However these image classifiers are not optimized to bring together semantically similar images in the embedding space.

Visualize Train Images Multi Crop Resize Data AugmentationProduces multiple views of the same image instead of just a pair of views without quadratically increasing the memory and computational requirement. t supervised model pre training would be an understatement as evident from the figure below img https i. com facebookresearch swav issues 19 crops_for_assign 0 1 get assignments sinkhorn is used for cluster assignment cluster assignment prediction for rest of the portions compute p and take cross entropy with q backprop. Use larger image size 224 96 better features. v2 I wanted to see the effect on CV with only image embedding by using ResNet pretrained with SwAV vs good old ResNet. 09882 Moreover when the features learned using these different self supervised methods are fine tuned with as little as 1 and 10 of labeled training data show tremendous performance image. com facebookresearch swav blob master main_swav.
