You can understand more about unet from https arxiv. Loading DataNow we will load the data by using custom data loader from pytorch along with small preprocessing such as horizontal fliping and normalization. com arunm8489 an overview on u net architecture d6caabf7caa4 post. Combined the two methods allows for some diversity in the loss while benefitting from the stability of BCE. Also implementation of same using keras is described in my blog http https medium. Similarly we use intersection over union as a metricNow we will write some utility functions to save and load best model on training Model training Plotting Loss and IOU Scores Visualisation of actual and predicted mask mkdir kaggle working data unzip kaggle input data science bowl 2018 stage1_train. This will be a quick and dirty kernel showing how to get started on segmenting nuclei using a neural network in Pytorch. sigmoid x comment out if your model contains a sigmoid or equivalent activation layer flatten label and prediction tensors ref https towardsdatascience. zip d kaggle working data only horizontal flip as of now loading the data print out some sample data some utility functions converting tensor to image splitting to trainset and validation set and loading the data with batch size of 10 we will try visualizing images and corresponding masks out self. The architecture used is the so called U Net which is very common for image segmentation problems such as this.
