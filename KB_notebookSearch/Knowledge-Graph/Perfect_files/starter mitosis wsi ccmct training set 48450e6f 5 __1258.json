Happy Kaggling plotting linear algebra accessing directory structure data processing CSV file I O e. If you re inspired to dig deeper click the blue Fork Notebook button at the top of this kernel to begin editing. Depending on the data not all plots will be made. read_csv Distribution graphs histogram bar graph of column data For displaying purposes pick columns that have between 1 and 50 unique values Correlation matrix drop columns with NaN keep columns where there are more than 1 unique values Scatter and density plots keep only numerical columns Remove rows and columns that would lead to df being singular keep columns where there are more than 1 unique values reduce the number of columns for matrix inversion of kernel density plots. Hey I m just a simple kerneling bot not a Kaggle Competitions Grandmaster There is 0 csv file in the current version of the dataset The next hidden code cells define functions for plotting data. This will create a copy of the code and environment for you to edit. In the meantime please feel free to try a different dataset. Click on the Code button in the published kernel to reveal the hidden code. IntroductionGreetings from the Kaggle bot This is an automatically generated kernel with starter code demonstrating how to read in the data and begin exploring. ConclusionThis concludes your starter analysis To go forward from here click the blue Fork Notebook button at the top of this kernel. Oh no There are no automatic insights available for the file types used in this dataset. Exploratory AnalysisTo begin this exploratory analysis first import libraries and define functions for plotting the data using matplotlib. Delete modify and add code as you please.
