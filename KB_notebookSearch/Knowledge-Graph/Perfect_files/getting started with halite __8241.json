Game strategyAs mentioned above a ship has two options at its disposal for collecting halite. use a shipyard to create a ship. You can use the animation below to view the game in detail every move is captured and can be replayed. Both are illustrated in the figure below. If cargo is too low collect halite If cargo gets very big deposit halite If halite at current location running low move to the adjacent square containing the most halite Move towards shipyard to deposit cargo. com notebooks https www. With more ships and shipyards you can collect halite at a faster rate. png You now have a notebook where you ll develop your first agent If you re not sure how to use Kaggle Notebooks we strongly recommend that you walk through this notebook https www. com alexisbcook getting started with titanic before proceeding. Part 3 Keep learning This first agent is just the beginning. Halite in ship cargo is not counted towards final scores. There are three primary actions in the game involving shipyards. Grid locations with halite are indicated by a light blue icon where larger icons indicate more available halite. It can collect or mine halite from its current position. com notebooks and clicking on New Notebook. When a ship decides to collect halite it collects 25 of the halite available in its cell. Your agent is in the top left corner of the screen. If there are no shipyards convert first ship into shipyard. Players start the game with no shipyards. These are illustrated in the image below. In order for halite to be counted ships need to deposit their cargo into a shipyard of the same color. collide with an enemy ship containing relatively more halite in its cargo. To see the current list of open competitions check out the simulations homepage https www. This is the only way to create a shipyard. Part 1 Get startedIn this section you ll learn more about how to play the game. In this tutorial as part of the Halite competition https www. com sam halite sdk overview to simplify the code we need to write. Halite is an online multiplayer game created by Two Sigma. com c halite overview you ll write your own intelligent bots to play the game. For context we ll look at a game played by four random players. If the code cell runs successfully then you ll see a message Writing submission. The line writefile submission. You ll also have to decide how to control your shipyards and how your ships interact with shipyards. If you view the full game rules you ll notice that there are more types of collisions that can occur in the game for instance ships can collide with enemy shipyards which destroys the ship the ship s cargo and the enemy shipyard. You can convert a ship into a shipyard. Conversely if there are many ships nearby with halite to steal and not too much local halite to collect it makes sense to attack the enemy ships. Over time and with effort your score will gradually improve. _Don t change the default settings so Python should appear under Select language and you should have Notebook selected under Select type. But even given these simplified rules you can imagine that a successful player will have to use a relatively complicated strategy. For simplicity we ve only covered a subset of the rules here. But you ll need a complete understanding of the game dynamics to come up with a winning strategy. Imports helper functions Returns best direction to move from one position fromPos to another toPos Example If I m at pos 0 and want to get to pos 55 which direction should I choose Directions a ship can move Will keep track of whether a ship is collecting halite or carrying cargo to a shipyard Returns the commands we send to our ships and shipyards If there are no ships use first shipyard to spawn a ship. Your first agentIt s time to create your first agent Copy and paste the code in the cell below into your notebook. If this is the case try copying the code cell and running it again. The game is played in a 21 by 21 gridworld and lasts 400 timesteps. com learn intro to game ai and reinforcement learning course is a great resource to get started with techniques for creating intelligent agents. A ship can deposit all of its cargo in a single timestep simply by navigating to a cell containing a shipyard. In the game four participants command ships to collect an energy source called halite. Game rules In this section we ll look more closely at the game rules and explore the different icons on the game board. Note that the Halite competition is now closed so we are no longer accepting submissions. Look at the Notebooks tab https www. Have questions or comments Visit the course discussion forum https www. com learn intro to game ai and reinforcement learning discussion to chat with other learners. It teaches you how to run code in the notebook. The player with the most halite at the end of the game wins. com c halite overview environment rules. In this case the ship destroys the enemy ship and steals its cargo. But each additional ship and shipyard costs you halite how will you decide when it might be beneficial to create more Part 2 Your first botIn this section you ll create your first bot to play the game. Here are some resources to keep learning The first step is to read the complete game rules https www. Two ships cannot successfully inhabit the same cell. A ship can only collect halite from its current position. This raises some questions that you ll have to answer when commanding ships Will your ships focus primarily on locating large halite reserves and mining them efficiently while mostly ignoring and evading the other players Or will you look for opportunities to steal halite from other players Alternatively can you use a combination of those two strategies If so what cues will you look for in the game to decide which option is best For instance if all enemy ships are far away and your ships are located on cells containing a lot of halite it makes sense to focus on mining halite. Players use ships to navigate the world and collect halite. In general Halite is a complex game and we have not covered all of the details here. The agent you just submitted uses Sam Harris Halite SDK https www. The cargo that is tracked in the player s scoreboard contains the total cargo summed over all of the player s ships. That said you can still use the competition to write your own bots you just cannot submit bots to the official leaderboard. The notebookThe first thing to do is to create a Kaggle notebook where you ll store all of your code. Check out the notebook to see what other helper functions are available. This collected halite is added to the ship s cargo. To get a shipyard a player must convert a ship into a shipyard which costs 500 halite. This event results in a collision where the ship with more halite in its cargo is destroyed and the other ship survives and instantly collects the destroyed ship s cargo. py saves the agent to a Python file. Next click on Create. Begin by navigating to https www. Note that all of the code above has to be copied and run in a single cell please do not split the code into multiple cells. Your agent should perform much better than the random agents Note that if your ship doesn t move at all in the game then you ve likely made an error in the code you used to generate the submission. deposit a ship s cargo into a shipyard. Then copy and run the next code cell in your notebook to play your agent against three random agents. Also shipyards can spawn or create new ships which deducts 500 halite per ship from the player. Each player starts the game with 5 000 halite and one ship. Kaggle s Intro to Game AI and Reinforcement Learning https www. py if you run it more than once.
