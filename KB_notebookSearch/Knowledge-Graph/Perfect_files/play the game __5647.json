To see a list of these default agents run The random agent selects uniformly at random from the set of valid moves. Make sure that the code makes sense to you Evaluating agentsTo have the custom agents play one game round we use the same env. For fairness each agent goes first half of the time.

The second agent always selects the middle column whether it s valid or not Note that if any agent selects an invalid move it loses the game. Join the competitionThroughout the course you ll test your agents performance by competing against agents that other users have created. Have questions or comments Visit the course discussion forum https www. You must accept the competition rules in order to participate. So the returned value is one of 0 6 inclusive. _Try this now _As you ll soon see this information will prove incredibly useful for brainstorming ways to improve our agents. Getting startedThe game environment comes equipped with agents that have already been implemented for you. In the code cell below this agent plays one game round against a copy of itself. The next two lessons focus on traditional methods for building game AI. It returns an integer with the selected column where indexing starts at zero. In this course you will build your own intelligent agents to play the game. board the game board a Python list with one item for each grid location obs. To get a better idea we ll calculate the win percentages for each agent averaged over multiple games. _If you see a Submit Agent button instead of a Join Competition button you have already joined the competition and don t need to do so again. To do this we ll use the get_win_percentages function defined in a hidden code cell. com learn intro to game ai and reinforcement learning discussion to chat with other learners. Introduction Connect Four https en. You can use the player above to view the game in detail every move is captured and can be replayed. In the first lesson you ll learn how to set up the game environment and create your first agent. For instance for this game board obs. board is a Python list that shows the locations of the discs where the first row appears first followed by the second row and so on. _To view the details of this function click on the Code button below. So what are obs and config exactly obs obs contains two pieces of information obs. config config contains three pieces of information config. Defining agentsTo participate in the competition you ll create your own agents. The third agent selects the leftmost valid column. The agents that you build will come up with gameplay strategies much like humans do gradually and with experience. com kernels fork 7677818. We use 1 to track player 1 s discs and 2 to track player 2 s discs. Your agent should be implemented as a Python function that accepts two arguments obs and config. _ This takes you to the rules acceptance page. These agents will be smart enough to defeat many novice players In the final lesson you ll experiment with cutting edge algorithms from the field of reinforcement learning. Each player uses a different color usually red or yellow and the objective of the game is to be the first player to get four discs in a row.
