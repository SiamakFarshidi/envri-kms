{"name": "data augmentation and tensorflow u net ", "full_name": " ", "stargazers_count": 0, "forks_count": 0, "description": "The prediction would make some very sparse pixel which should not be consider as a Nuclei. The augmented sample could be not the same shape as the original image they should all be resize before feed in deep learning model. Thus a Low pass filter or Markov Random Field could be apply to expel those pixels3. Fig 3 4 is the input and the prediction on test imageThe overall OUI on the validation set is near 90 Three quesion remain for this network 1. After passing forward the network the result is shown as below result http i64. How to regenerate a reliable seperated mask from the concatenated mask. The following code is to save the augmented data locally. most of the content in this function is taken from Example Metric Implementation kernel by William Cukierski Create Afine transform Apply transform to image data Randomly corpping image frame Ramdomly flip frame also save the original image in augmented file build the graph as a dictionary. For example running this by clicking run or pressing Shift Enter will list the files in the input directory Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output. The threshold of the prediction pixcel is hard to determined. png Fig 1 2 is the ground truth and prediction of a vaildation image. Here comes an example of randomly rotate and resize an image. It is only useful for Linux operating systemHere we also provide our tensorflow version UNet the visualization on tensorboard is shown as below graph http i67. the result generated by morphology from skimage is not reliable for cell that has interception. I would be happy if someone could share their points of view on the question above. read_csv Input data files are available in the. I think the OSTU adative threshold could be useful for the prediction. This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed linear algebra data processing CSV file I O e. png To train the model we can use a graph dictionary like this prediction result The model use one channel label to classify if a pixel is belong to mask or background.
