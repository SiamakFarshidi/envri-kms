So lets give it a try. com max 910 1 CjpipU_oChc899f_Esjpyg. know more about NFNethttps arxiv. Human Protein Atlas Single Cell Classification This is a weakly supervised multi label classification problem and a code competition. 06171 nfnets https miro. Given images of cells from our microscopes and labels of protein location assigned together for all cells in the image develop models capable of classifying each individual cell with precise labels NFNetSo google has come up with a faster bread of CNN architecture called NFNet Normalizer free network which can be trained in larger batch sizes and stronger data augmentations and have set new SOTA validation accuracies on ImageNet.
