Exploratory Data AnalysisExploratory data analysis EDA is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics often with visual methods. Learning rate will be half after 3 epochs if accuracy is not increased Visualize few samples of current training dataset CNN takes images in shape batch_size h w channels so reshape the images Divide the data into training and validation set Data augmentation for creating more training data set input mean to 0 over the dataset set each sample mean to 0 divide inputs by std of the dataset divide each input by its std apply ZCA whitening randomly rotate images in the range degrees 0 to 180 Randomly zoom image randomly shift images horizontally fraction of total width randomly shift images vertically fraction of total height randomly flip images randomly flip images This will just calculate parameters required to augment the given data. com kaggle docker python For example here s several helpful packages to load in linear algebra data processing CSV file I O e. read_csv Input data files are available in the. This won t perform any augmentations Fit the model Delete to reduce memory usage model predictions placeholder row_id place holder. Set a learning rate annealer. Training loop This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed It is defined by the kaggle python docker image https github. Number of unique values Most used top 10 Grapheme Roots in training set Least used 10 Grapheme Roots in training set Top 5 Vowel Diacritic in taining data Top 5 Consonant Diacritic in training dataLet s apply some image processing credits this kernel https www. Basic ModelLet s visualize the 3 tailed 3 output CNN by plotting it. For example running this by clicking run or pressing Shift Enter will list all files under the input directory Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.
