XgBoost is a powerful algorithm and very popular in Data Science competition. GaussianNB to build the model. This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed It is defined by the kaggle python docker image https github. Next time I will try to oppotimize the parameters of XgBoost. For example running this by clicking run or pressing Shift Enter will list the files in the input directory Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.
