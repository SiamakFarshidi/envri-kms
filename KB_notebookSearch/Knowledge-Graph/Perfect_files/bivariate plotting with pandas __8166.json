Another simple example is the area plot which lends itself very naturally to this form of manipulation Like single variable area charts multivariate area charts are meant for nominal categorical or interval variables. Note that in order to make effective use of this plot we had to downsample our data taking just 100 points from the full set. For example if two wines both costing 100 dollars get a rating of 90 then the second one is overplotted onto the first one and we add just one point to the plot. Stacked plotsScatter plots and hex plots are new. The first limitation is that the second variable in a stacked plot must be a variable with a very limited number of possible values probably an ordinal categorical as here. Suppose we create a scatter plot but find that due to the large number of points it s hard to interpret. They work best for nominal categorical or small ordinal categorical variables. Hexplots and scatter plots can by applied to combinations of interval variables and or ordinal categorical variables. We ve already demonstrated one way sampling the points. For example looking at the plots above can you tell which wine got a score of 87 more often Red Blends in purple Pinot Noir in red or Chardonnay in green It s actually really hard to tell Bivariate line chartOne plot type we ve seen already that remains highly effective when made bivariate is the line chart. Because the line in this chart takes up so little visual space it s really easy and effective to overplot multiple lines on the same chart. We ll start with the stacked bar chart. Click here to move on to the next section Plotting with seaborn https www. wine_counts counts the number of times each of the possible review scores was received by the five most commonly reviewed types of wines Many pandas multivariate plots expect input data to be in this format with one categorical variable in the columns one categorical variable in the rows and counts of their intersections in the entries. HexplotA hex plot aggregates points in space into hexagons and then colors those hexagons based on the values within them note the x axis is points but is missing from the chart due to a bug The data in this plot is directly comparable with that in the scatter plot from earlier but the story it tells us is very different. Another interesting way to do this that s built right into pandas is to use our next plot type a hexplot. The second limitation is one of interpretability. By doing away with this problem this hexplot presents us a much more useful view of the dataset. Let s now look at some stacked plots. However they have two major limitations. What type of data makes sense to show in a stacked bar chart but not in a bivariate line chart 3. From this hexplot we can see that the bottles of wine reviewed by Wine Magazine cluster around 87. Bivariate plotting with pandasScatter PlotHex PlotStacked Bar ChartBivariate Line Chartdf. In the previous notebook we explored using pandas to plot and understand relationships within a single column. Data without relationships between variables is the data science equivalent of a blank canvas. Scatter plotThe simplest bivariate plot is the lowly scatter plot. This is because naive scatter plots do not effectively treat points which map to the same place. A scatter plot or hex plot is good for what two types of data 2. com residentmario plotting with seaborn. ExercisesIn this section of the tutorial we introduced and explored some common bivariate plot types Scatter plots Hex plots Stacked bar charts and area charts Bivariate line chartsLet s now put what we ve learned to the test To start off try answering the following questions 1. In this notebook we ll expand this view by looking at plots that consider two variables at a time. Good for interval and some nominal categorical data. line Good for interval and some nominal categorical data. A stacked chart is one which plots the variables one on top of the other. We ll use a supplemental selection of the five most common wines for this next section. Bivariate line charts are much more interpretable because the lines themselves don t take up much space. We can see here that the Chardonnay in green narrowly beats out the Pinot Noir in red. For example in this chart we can easily answer our question from the previous example which wine most commonly scores an 87. But we can also use the simpler plots we saw in the last notebook. This isn t a problem if it happens just a few times. But with enough points the distribution starts to look like a shapeless blob and you lose the forest for the trees Because of their weakness to overplotting scatter plots work best with relatively small datasets and with variables which have a large number of unique values. A simple scatter plot simply maps each variable of interest to a point in two dimensional space. For thee next plot use the following data For the next plot use the following data ConclusionIn this section we introduced and explored some common bivariate plot types Scatter plots Hex plots Stacked bar charts and area charts Bivariate line chartsIn the next section we will move on to exploring another plotting library seaborn which compliments pandas with many more advanced data visualization tools for you to use. Five different types of wine is a good number because it keeps the result interpretable eight is sometimes mentioned as a suggested upper bound. We did not see this effect by looking at the scatter plot because too many similarly priced similarly scoring wines were overplotted. Their values remain readable when we place multiple lines side by side as here. This is the result This plot shows us that price and points are weakly correlated that is that more expensive wines do generally earn more points when reviewed. Does an increase in one variable correlate with an increase in another Does it relate to a decrease somewhere else The best way to paint the picture in is by using plots that enable these possibilities. Many dataset fields will not fit this critereon naturally so you have to make do as here by selecting a group of interest. Stacked bar plots share the strengths and weaknesses of univariate bar charts. To paint the picture in we need to understand how variables interact with one another. To see the answers hit the Input button below to un hide the code. Good for nominal and ordinal categorical data. What are two things we can do to fix this issue To see the answers click the Output button on the cell below. Recall the Pokemon dataset from earlier For the exercises that follow try forking this notebook and replicating the plots that follow. Using a line chart this way makes inroads against the second limitation of stacked plotting interpretability. Stacked plots are visually very pretty. What type of data makes sense to show in a bivariate line chart but not in a stacked bar chart 4. 5 points and around 20. The easiest way to modify them to support another visual variable is by using stacking. There are a few ways to deal with overplotting. Good for ordinal categorical and interval data. As easy as they are to make and as pretty as they look stacked plots make it really hard to distinguish concrete values.
