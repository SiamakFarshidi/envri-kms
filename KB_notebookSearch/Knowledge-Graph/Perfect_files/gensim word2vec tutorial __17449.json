It can be found here https www. What troubled me the most in these online tutorials was their mismanagement of the model training the code worked and I got results which appeared to be decent at first but the more I looked into them the more disturbing they were. pipe attribute to speed up the cleaning process Put the results in a DataFrame to remove missing values and duplicates Bigrams We are using Gensim Phrases package to automatically detect common phrases bigrams from a list of sentences. During my experimentations I noticed that lemmatizing the sentences or looking for phrases bigrams in them had a big impact over the results and performance of my models. Burns ranked 1st to 10th versus the ones ranked 11th to 20th PS Mr. With the loggings I can follow the progress and even more important the effect of min_count and sample on the word corpus. 8 Random words Let s compare where the vector representation of Homer his 10 most similar words from the model as well as 8 random ones lies in a 2D graph Interestingly the 10 most similar words to Homer ends up around him so does Apu and sideshow Bob two recurrent characters. com luckylwk visualising high dimensional datasets using pca and t sne in python 8ef87e7915bOur goal in this section is to plot our 300 dimensions vectors into 2 dimensional graphs and see if we can spot interesting patterns. Word2Vec In this first step I set up the parameters of the model one by one. Training the model Gensim Word2Vec Implementation We use Gensim implementation of word2vec https radimrehurek.

As all good data scientists I directly applied and reproduced the code samples from multiple website. End End Briefing about Word2Vec 1 References Purpose of the tutorial As I said before this tutorial focuses on the right use of the Word2Vec package from the Gensim libray therefore I am not going to explain the concepts and ideas behind Word2Vec here. Retrieved from http www. References References 10. 11th to 20th Most similar words 6. com 2016 04 19 word2vec tutorial the skip gram model A great Gensim implentation tutorial http kavita ganesan. I do not pledge that it is perfect nor the best way to implement Word2Vec simply that it is better than a good chunk of what is out there Plan1. Confused and often disappointed by the results I got I went deeper and deeper from stackoverflow threads to Gensim s Google Groups onto the documentation of the library to try and understand what went wrong in my approach. org project xlrd spaCy 2.

Gensim Word2Vec Tutorial MotivationAs I started working at Supportiv http www. ai wiki word2vec Another Word2Vec introduction http mccormickml. Along with the papers the researchers published their implementation in C. I am simply going to give a very brief explanation and provide you with links to good in depth tutorials. Aneesha Bakharia Medium article https medium. Final ThoughtsI hope you found this tutorial useful and had as much fun reading it as I had writing it. window words on the left and window words on the left of our target 2 10 size int Dimensionality of the feature vectors. The underlying assumption of Word2Vec is that two words sharing similar contexts also share a similar meaning and consequently a similar vector representation from the model. html Why I seperate the training of the model in 3 steps I prefer to separate the training in 3 distinctive steps for clarity and monitoring. Here is a good tutorial on it https medium. From this assumption Word2Vec can be used to find out the relations between words in a dataset compute the similarity between them or use the vector representation of those words as input for other applications such as text classification or clustering. Code inspired by 2 References 10 Most similar words vs. 10 Most similar words vs. com gensim models word2vec. Displaying both allows for a more accurate and an easier management of their influence. 0 https radimrehurek. 10 Most dissimilarThis time let s compare where the vector representation of Maggie and her 10 most similar words from the model lies compare to the vector representation of the 10 most dissimilar words to Maggie Neat Maggie and her most similar words form a distinctive cluster from the most dissimilar words it is a really encouraging plot 10 Most similar words vs. Getting Started Setting up the environment python 3. To make the visualizations more relevant we will look at the relationships between a query word in red its most similar words in the model in blue and other words from the vocabulary in green. Maggie is indeed the most renown baby in the Simpsons Bart and Nelson though friends are not that close makes sense Odd One Out Here we ask our model to give us the word that does not belong to the list Between Jimbo Milhouse and Kearney who is the one who is not a bully Milhouse of course What if we compared the friendship between Nelson Bart and Milhouse Seems like Nelson is the odd one here Last but not least how is the relationship between Homer and his two sister in laws Damn they really do not like you Homer Analogy difference Which word is to woman as homer is to marge man comes at the first position that looks about right Which word is to woman as bart is to man Lisa is Bart s sister her male counterpart t SNE visualizations t SNE is a non linear dimensionality reduction algorithm that attempts to represent high dimensional data and the underlying relationships between vectors in a lower dimensional space. I noticed that these two parameters and in particular sample have a great influence over the performance of a model. 0 1e 5 alpha float The initial learning rate 0. Final Thoughts Final Thoughts 7. Brief explanation Word2Vec was introduced in two papers Material for more in depths understanding between September and October 2013 by a team of researchers at Google. Though the influence of the preprocessing varies with each dataset and application I thought I would include the data preparation steps in this tutorial and use the great spaCy library along with it. 4546 Acknowledgements Pouria Mojabi https www. com gensim models phrases. For instance dog puppy and pup are often used in similar situations with similar surrounding words like good fluffy or cute and according to Word2Vec they will therefore share a similar vector representation. train Finally trains the model. After weeks of hard labor I finally managed to get decent results but I was frustrated by these online tutorials which were for the most part misleading. Removes non alphabetic characters Taking advantage of spaCy. 3 Libraries used xlrd 1. com gensim word2vec tutorial starter code. Please do not hesitate to leave any comments questions or suggestions you might have. The parameters min_count int Ignores all words with total absolute frequency lower than this 2 100 window int The maximum distance between the current and predicted word within a sentence. The loggings here are mainly useful for monitoring making sure that no threads are executed instantaneously. I do not supply the parameter sentences and therefore leave the model uninitialized purposefully. com pierremegret dialogue lines of the simpsonsThe missing values comes from the part of the script where something happens but with no dialogue. I wasted a lot of time figuring out what was wrong. 5 20 workers int Use these many worker threads to train the model faster training with multicore machines Building the Vocabulary Table Word2Vec requires us to build the vocabulary table simply digesting all the words and filtering out the unique words and doing some basic counts on them Training of the model _Parameters of the training _ total_examples int Count of sentences epochs int Number of iterations epochs over the corpus 10 20 30 As we do not plan to train the model any further we are calling init_sims which will make the model much more memory efficient Exploring the model Most similar to Here we will ask our model to find the word most similar to some of the most iconic characters of the Simpsons Let s see what we get for the show s main character _A small precision here _The dataset is the Simpsons lines of dialogue therefore when we look at the most similar words from homer we do not necessary get his family members personality traits or even his most quotable words. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PLAYGROUND AFTERNOON Removing the missing values Cleaning We are lemmatizing and removing the stopwords and non alphabetic characters for each line of dialogue. For that we are going to use t SNE implementation from scikit learn. 50 300 sample float The threshold for configuring which higher frequency words are randomly downsampled. For instance Springfield Elementary School EXT. 11th to 20th Most similar words Finally we are going to plot the most similar words to Mr. Burns became mr_burn after the preprocessing As we can see and that is very nice all the 20 words are forming one cluster around Mr. However I always thought that one of the most important parts of the creation of a Word2Vec model was then missing. com the support network for instant peer support a few months ago I began looking into Language Models and Word2Vec particularly. htmlThe main reason we do this is to catch words like mr_burns or bart_simpson As Phrases takes a list of list of words as input Creates the relevant phrases from the list of sentences The goal of Phraser is to cut down memory consumption of Phrases by discarding model state not strictly needed for the bigram detection task Transform the corpus based on the bigrams detected Most Frequent Words Mainly a sanity check of the effectiveness of the lemmatization removal of stopwords and addition of bigrams. html The data I chose to play with the script from the Simpsons both because I love the Simpsons and because with more than 150k lines of dialogues the dataset was substantial This dataset contains the characters locations episode details and script lines for approximately 600 Simpsons episodes dating back to 1989. 1 http scikit learn. 05 min_alpha float Learning rate will linearly drop to min_alpha as training progresses. 11th to 20th Most similar words 10 Most similar words vs. Let s see what the bigram homer_simpson gives us by comparison What about Marge now Let s check Bart now Looks like it is making sense Willie the groundskeeper for the last one Similarities Here we will see how similar are two words to each other Who could forget Moe s tavern Not Barney. 8 Random words 10 Most similar words vs. Material for more in depths understanding Material for more in depths understanding 8. 3781 and https arxiv. com in pouria mojabi 1873615 co fouder of Supportiv Inc. 10 Most dissimilar 10 Most similar words vs. com d msg gensim jom4JFt7EV8 y5fjhupbAgAJ so I decided to write my own tutorial. com around Simpson ized logo Materials for more in depths understanding Word Embeddings introduction https www. 00 negative int If 0 negative sampling will be used the int for negative specifies how many noise words should be drown. No we get what other characters as Homer does not often refers to himself at the 3rd person said along with homer such as how he feels or looks depressed where he is hammock or with whom marge.
