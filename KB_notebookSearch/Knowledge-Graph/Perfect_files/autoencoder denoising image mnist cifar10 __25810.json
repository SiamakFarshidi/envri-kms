There are other uses as well such as using autoencoder for sequential data. png Noise reduction or denoising is the process of removal of noise form any signal or data input. html An autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network used to learn efficient data codings in an unsupervised manner. It helps in restoring the pieces of information which can be lost during convolution and deconvolutions. Autoencoders are data specific means it can only compress data for which it has been trained. We can train our autoencoder to remove the noise from the data. Data can be images or audio. Input 1 2 3 4 Output 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 3 3 4 4 I am using a functional API of Keras.

So a good strategy for visualizing similarity relationships in high dimensional data is to start by using an autoencoder to compress your data into a low dimensional space e. Adding NoiseWe need to add noise to generate the noisy images. gif The need for transposed convolutions generally arises from the desire to use a transformation going in the opposite direction of a normal convolution i. After adding noise pixel values can be out of range 0 1 so we need to clip the values using np.

Components of Autoencoder Enoder Learns to reduce the data into low dimension Decoder Takes an encoded version of input and regenerate the data Bottleneck Compressed version of data Autoencode https lilianweng. But you can implement this idea to build your custom autoencoder. But deconvolution layer can combine the upsampling and convolution in one layer. In the future I will try to cover more uses of autoencoder with code implementation. io guides functional_api __call__ python Read More1 https www. org api_docs python tf keras layers UpSampling2D Encoder DecoderActivation of our output layer is sigmoid to make every value between 0 1. Unlike other compression algorithms such as JPEG can compress any image input this is not true for autoencoders. UpSampling2D layer increases the dimension opposite of MaxPool which reduces the dimension.
