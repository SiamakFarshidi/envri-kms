Words like ran and running are converted to run to avoid having words with similar meanings in our data. Topic modeling is a frequently used text mining tool for discovery of hidden semantic structures in a text body. What is topic modelling In machine learning and natural language processing a topic model is a type of statistical model for discovering the abstract topics that occur in a collection of documents. It involves various techniques of dimensionality reduction mostly non linear and unsupervised learning like LDA SVD autoencoders etc. Hover over the topics on the left to get information about their keywords on the right. You can pass in one or more Doc objects and start a web server export HTML files or view the visualization directly from a Jupyter Notebook. My recent kernels deal with deep learning and I want to extend that by using text data for deep learning and intend to use spaCy for processing and modelling this data. Kindly upvote and comment if you like this. LemmatizationIt is the process of grouping together the inflected forms of a word so they can be analysed as a single item identified by the word s lemma or dictionary form. com nirant hitchhiker s guide to nlp in spacy has made me realize that spaCy maybe as good or even better than NLTK for Natural Language Processing. its relationship with adjacent and related words in a phrase sentence or paragraph. A document typically concerns multiple topics in different proportions thus in a document that is 10 about cats and 90 about dogs there would probably be about 9 times more dog words than cat words. spaCy also comes with a built in named entity visualizer that lets you check your model s predictions in your browser. Selection of keywords is based on their frequency and discriminancy. A simplified form of this is commonly taught to school age children in the identification of words as nouns verbs adjectives adverbs etc. Parts of Speech taggingThis is the process of marking up a word in a text corpus as corresponding to a particular part of speech 1 based on both its definition and its context i. Usual imports Plotly based imports for visualization spaCy based imports Loading data Creating a spaCy object POS tagging Parser for reviews Creating a vectorizer Latent Dirichlet Allocation Model Non Negative Matrix Factorization Model Latent Semantic Indexing Model using Truncated SVD Functions for printing keywords for each topic Keywords for topics clustered by Latent Dirichlet Allocation Keywords for topics clustered by Latent Semantic Indexing Keywords for topics clustered by Non Negative Matrix Factorization Transforming an individual sentence create spacy object separate nouns and not nouns. Aim and Motivation Nirant https www. Source Wikipedia https en. Topics on the left while their respective keywords are on the right. Visualizing LSI SVD scatterplotWe will be visualizing our data for 2 topics to see similarity between keywords which is measured by distance with the markers using LSI model The text version of scatter plot looks messy but you can zoom it for great resultsLet s see what happens when we use a spaCy based bigram tokenizer for topic modelling LDA for bigram data Topics for bigram model Very few keywords with 2 words have been found like spin dry black cherry etc. Named Entity Recognition Named Entity Recognition is an information extraction task where named entities in unstructured sentences are located and classified in some pre defined categories such as the person names organizations locations medical codes time expressions quantities monetary values percentages etc. The sentence looks much different now that it is lemmatized. Larger topics are more frequent and closer the topics mor the similarity3. Intuitively given that a document is about a particular topic one would expect particular words to appear in the document more or less frequently dog and bone will appear more often in documents about dogs cat and meow will appear in documents about cats and the and is will appear equally in both. The topics produced by topic modeling techniques are clusters of similar words. org wiki Topic_model The index in the above list with the largest value represents the most dominant topic for the given review. A topic model captures this intuition in a mathematical framework which allows examining a set of documents and discovering based on the statistics of the words in each what the topics might be and what each document s balance of topics is. com nirant s latest kernel on spaCy Hitchhiker s Guide to NLP in spaCy https www.
