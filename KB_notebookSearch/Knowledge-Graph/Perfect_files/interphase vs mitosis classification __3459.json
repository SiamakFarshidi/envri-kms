Centrosomal clustering contributes to chromosomal instability and cancer. Although the accuracy is very high it should also be noted that the dataset was highly imbalanced and there is room for improvement in terms of reducing bias and improving the precision and recall scores. Likewise deep learning algorithms have been demonstrated as capable of identifying cell cycle stages during cellular division Eulenberg 2017. Interphase vs Mitosis Classification 90 Nematode cells and 32 000 Jurkat cellsDifferences in the rates of cellular division and differences in the amount of time spent in each stage of cellular division are important differentiators between healthy cells and cancer cells Sherr 1996 Visconti 2016. Step 1 Import Modules Step 2 Explore Nematode Cell Data The min max pixel values are already scaled between 0 and 120 images from category Interphase 20 images from category Mitosis Note class size imbalance Step 3 Explore Jurkat Cell Data The min max pixel values are already scaled between 0 and 120 images from category G1 G2 S 20 images from category Metaphase Note class size imbalance Step 4 Build and Evaluate an ML Model using Fastai and the Jurkat Cell Data 97 accuracy using the default Fastai image classifier.
