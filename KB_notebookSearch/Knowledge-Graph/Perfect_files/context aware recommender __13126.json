Generate Final Recommendations5. If not the median of timestamps can be considered as the time of the visit with new contexts. Ratings is also normilized by the min max normalization method. So to address this problem a weighted user s influence coefficient is suggested. Collaborative filtering using asymmetric cosine similarity and matrix factorization MF_ACOS The difference between this model and the cosine similarity approach is to eliminate the sparsity of the similarity matrix by using the matrix factorization 1 http dx. P_ l_i is the set of all photos taken in location l_i in which the geographical coordinate of the centroid is g_ l_i. We also compare the performance of proposed model against some other recommendation methods. The dataset contains photo records including meta tags related to photos and users who took them. For making recommendation model only tourists who have visited at least 4 distinct locations were selected. Chen A system for mining in teresting tourist locations and travel sequences from public geo tagged photos Data Knowledge Engineering vol. So through a trial and error approach we determine the appropriate values for eps and min_pts min_samples. After calculating the visiting probability the final rating associated with each candidate location is obtained by begin equation score u_a i collaborative filtering rate times visit probability end equation As an example let s see the result of rating prediction related to a user visited different locations in London city. Clusters AnalysisThe plots below illustrate all clusters and their centroids in two geographical and non geographical views. 006 is as follow begin equation ACOS u v frac overrightarrow r_1. They are classified into non contextual and context aware categories. Each location identified in the clustering contains information such as the geographical location id of the user who visited the venue visiting time and visiting contexts. net publication 309541764_Context Aware_Location_Recommendation_Using_Geotagged_Photos_in_Social_Media. Loading DataLet s load data into the raw dataframe. N_ oslash oslash is the total number of visits to all locations and N_ oslash l represents the total number of visits to the location l. It also uses a probability ratio to find the visit probability of locations similar to the target user s context which is applied to the collaborative filtering results as a post filtering 2 https www. Pre Filtering Using DBSCAN clustering we try to remove noise coordinates and find potential locations can be considered as tourist venues. Evaluation In the final step we evaluate the proposed method based on common evaluation metrics in recommendation systems MAP and RMSE. overrightarrow r_v. Pre filtering Locations3. frac 2 u cap v u v end equation In case of having same numbers of items venues rated by both users the ACOS u_1 u_2 will be equal to ACOS u_2 u_1. We use the user based collaborative filtering to predict the initial ratings. Jung Exploiting matrix factorization to asymmetric user similarities in recommendation systems Knowledge Based Systems vol. The output of DBSCAN is a set of photo clusters L l_1 l_2. ConclusionIn this kernel we create a tourism recommendation system based on contexts and geo tagged photos. In the next step the user similarity should be calculated. Recommendation Model The POI dataset including contextual factors is imported. A Context Aware Recommender SystemIn this notebook we will attempt at implementing a context aware recommender system. Traditional methods cannot differentiate between these two users. Creating Context Context Matrix Final Recommendation Based on the tourist location profiles and user similarities the locations which have not been rated by the user could be predicted by applying user based collaborative filtering. Context aware significant tourist locations recommendations CSR The basis of this model is to predict the ranking of the tourist location based on the context of the target user. Creating User Location MatrixTo create rating matrix we need to know the number of times when each user has visited different venues. Finding DBSCAN ParametersWe need to know the best performing parameters of DBSCAN clustering. For example a venue has been visited 3 times in the context 1 1 9 which means this context is equal to season spring daytime partly cloudy day weather day To make it easier to work with the data the value of each context has turned into numbers Weather 1 clear day 2 clear night 3 rain 4 snow 5 sleet 6 wind 7 fog 8 cloudy 9 partly cloudy day 10 partly cloudy night Season 1 spring 2 summer 3 autumn 4 winter Daytime 1 day 2 night 3 midnight We use a method based on TF IDF to find the visit probability of locations 2 https www. Collaborative filtering using asymmetric cosine similarity ACOS This method uses an asymmetric cosine similarity measure to find similarities among users then by collaborative filtering ratings can be predicted 1 http dx. frac 2 u cap v u v. Top 10 locations with the highest ratings would be a list of recommendations. However based on asymmetric similarity user u is similar to user v but not vice versa 1 http dx. Profiling locations This step identifies tourist locations their time of visits as well as visited pattern of each location in terms of different contextual factors. Data ValidationIn this step we find and remove rows including coordinates latitude and longitude with NA Null value. Next the outcome dataframe POI is exported in order to extract contextual features based on photos taken times then it will be imported again. overrightarrow r_v overrightarrow r_u. frac u cap v u. com science article abs pii S0169023X14000962. Finding the center of each cluster Because of the arbitrary shape of the clusters in DBSCAN method we find the reference point of each cluster by assuming the summation of latitudes and longitudes divided by numbers of points inside of each cluster. Evaluation Introduction This soultion includes two major steps pre filtering geo tagged data in order to detect tourists venues and building a recommendation model considering users asymmetric similarities and visit probablity in the user s current context. We use the term frequency inverse document frequency TF IDF measure to compute the usage of a location in a specific situation w_l c. net publication 309541764_Context Aware_Location_Recommendation_Using_Geotagged_Photos_in_Social_Media 3. The proposed method ultimately uses a context aware post filtering approach to determine the final recommendations. com science article abs pii S0169023X14000962 If you enjoyed reading the kernel hit the upvote button. According to the asymmetric similarity concept Most of the traditional similarity metrics assign equal value for the similarity relation between two users This means these methods are based on the assumption that sim u v sim v u. The system is able to understand various contextual conditions such as location time of visit day night season and weather conditions of the venue at the time of visit. Creating Context Location MatrixThe matrix below shows the number of visits from venues in various contexts. Pandas and Numpy configs Input data files are available in the. begin equation bar r_ u frac sum_ j 1 n r_ i j n_i end equation begin equation r_ u prime begin cases 1 qquad if quad r_u geq bar r_ u 0 qquad otherwise end cases end equation begin equation W_ u v prime frac sum_ i 1 n r_ u i prime times r_ v i prime sum_ i 1 n r_ v i prime end equation We propose an extended version of ACOS u v begin equation ACOS u v frac overrightarrow r_u. TF IDF is used in the field of information retrieval to measure how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. Our hybrid approach first looks for similarity among users using an asymmetric similarity metric and then uses collaborative filtering to predict the item ratings. DBSCANWe choose eps 120 and min_sample 10 to the data. A post filtering approach is used to adjust predicted ratings according to contextual information. The visit probability of each candidate location is calculated in the current contexts such that the probability of visiting the location i equals the fraction of the users who visited the location i in contexts similar to the target user and the similarity of the current contexts with the visiting context of the neighbors is larger than a threshold like delta. begin equation w_l c TF_l times IDF_l frac N_ c l N_ c oslash times log frac N_ oslash oslash N_ oslash l end equation N_ c l is the number of visits in context c that visited location l. Therefore if the duration between the time stamps of two photos taken by a user at the same location is less than visit duration threshold threshold we can cosider that both photos belong to a same location. overrightarrow r_2 overrightarrow r_1. Building Recommendation Model4. The proposed approach uses a hybrid collaborative filtering method in order to recommend locations in a city for users based on their history of visits and users contexts. Each member of this set is a tourist venue that can be considered as l_i P_ l_i g_ l_i. Center is the coordinate of the nearest point to the reference point. It increases proportionally with the number of times a word appears in the document is offset by the frequency of the word in the corpus 2 https www. This includes the steps below 1. Location ProfilingAt this step we are looking for features related to each tourist location extracted from the previous step. Context aware collaborative filtering using Sorensen Dice coef ficient Sorensen CaCF Post This method uses the Sorensen Dice coefficient to find similarity among users. Data then is split into training data and test data. Five different models have been selected from previous studies to compare with the proposed model. It is important to know that a user may take more than one photo of the place while visiting a venue.
