Pockets and zipper are usually located nearby and they are relatively small. 7 are associated only with 3 supercategories lowerbody upperbody and wholebody. Is there a way to filter train data somehow 4. There are also images which contain only 1 apparel already clipped. How often specific attributes or attribute groups appear within category s supercategory 3. Cloths from the same supercategory are similar in some sense. It is unclear at least for me if the train dataset attributes are given for all possible images or are these attributes provided for only a small subset of images. Masks associated with neck arms and hands closures are almost always small 0. As you can see from previous 2 plots number of mask annotations with any attribute is relatively small. That doesn t mean that there are no errors. Almost a half of the images have no shoes annotation. rotation 90 extract all available attributes and create separate table helper objects and methods. Now we will take a closer look at train dataset and check how many categories are presented there. And maybe it will improve segmentation results for both subsets. set_titles col_name row_name you can look at these images if you want. One of these parts might contain clipped clothes the other might contain full human body. Both attributes and categories contain additional supercategory column which might be the source of insights related to our data. Check Width and Height correctnessThere are no images with different width and height parameters in train. Do we have weakly labeled data or fully labeled data 3. For every other supercategory we might ignore them. Just in case we ll check all dimensions for train images and compare them with the ones provided in annotation file. This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed It is defined by the kaggle python docker image https github. Check if there are any duplicatesWe also check if there are any image masks with several accociated classes we might want to ignore them while training our segmentation model. For example running this by clicking run or pressing Shift Enter will list the files in the input directory Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output. We use supercategories to compare how mask_fraction distribution differs from supercategory to supercategory The biggest masks mask_fraction 0. com kaggle docker python For example here s several helpful packages to load in linear algebra data processing CSV file I O e. We can split train dataset to several parts. Train dataset contains a very diverse collection of images with a lot of small details. Next we fix annotation file. The most common duplicated mask is marked with image categories with ids 32 and 35. How many mask annotations have any associated attributes 2. They have particular clothes shown on it but there is no human on the photo. Shoe dominates in 2nd most common supercategory legs and feet that means that it might be worth to search for shoes on the photos Connecting categories and attributes Closer look at train data 1. Only masks related to 4 supercategories well 3 if we neglect 3 mask annotations related to garment parts have any associated attribute. It means that human body pictured on them if there is any is probably clipped. 1 of total image pixels. It is quite clear that for the draft segmentation model it is sufficient to use mask s category identifier and to ignore mask s attributes. There also might be pockets with zipper. Conclusions and other ideas1. read_csv Input data files are available in the. Let s take a look at some big masks mask_fraction 0. Maybe not a mistake after all MaskingFor every mask in train dataset we convert number of masks pixels to a fraction of total image pixels We named this parameter mask_fraction. 7 These sample images are all clipped. Attribute s supercategory denotes that it describes some specific property I. What supercategories are varied the most Relative counts for 3 supercategories decorations garment parts upperbody are shown below In the dataset the most common wholebody cloth type is dress.
