A common strategy for encoding categorical variables is One Hot Label or Dummy encoding where a new column is created for every N or N 1 of the possible values and those columns are given a value of 1 or 0 depending on whether the feature had that value. 3 The Examination of Categorical Features a href toc class btn btn primary btn sm role button aria pressed true style color blue background color e9a1ed data toggle popover Table of Contents Now we can compare each categorical variable with target variable for the bivariate analysis. A fourth variable can be set to correspond to the color or size of the markers thus adding yet another dimension to the plot. Multicollinearity Let s first plot the heatmap and examine the correlations among the features visually. Gender The customer s gender Male Female Age The customer s current age in years at the time of being customer. Based on the data and data dictionary We have a classification problem. The Framework in This Section 1. 4 Dummy Operation 4. Platykurtic Kurtosis will be less than 3 which implies thinner tail or lack of outliers than normal distribution. com exploratory data analysis with pandas profiling de3aae2ddff3 Let s remove the columns of rownumber customerid surname from the given dataset since they do NOT have any contribution to classification in our analysis. external link text https pandas.

Later S he will be familiar with Clustering algorithms in Deep Learning with Keras. Multi normality data tests are performed using leveling asymmetry tests skewness 3 Kurtosis between 2 and 2 and Mardia criterion 3. 5 is our threshold limit to evaluate skewness. It will be used for validation.

As easily understood from the plots we have an imbalanced data. Let s check if there is a multicollinearity problem among the features. https towardsdatascience. 1 User Defined Functions 1. This study in general will cover what any beginner in Deep Learning can do as much as possible for a better understanding with the given dataset not only by examining its various aspects but also visualising it. So evenif we accept the level of 0. The result suggested the deviation of data from normality was not severe as the value of skewness and kurtosis index were below 3 and 10 respectively Kline 2011. In short at the first hand what pandas profiling does is to save us all the work of visualizing and understanding the distribution of each variable. 2 Scaling Operation a href toc class btn btn primary btn sm role button aria pressed true style color blue background color e9a1ed data toggle popover Table of Contents MinMaxScaler is preferred for collecting data in a narrower range and for faster speed. The kutosis for normal distibution is 3. hascrcard The number of credit cards given to the customer by the bank. Otherwise missing data can reduce the statistical power of a study and can produce biased estimates leading to invalid conclusions. So in this Exploratory Data Analysis section the data will be analyzed by summarizing its main characteristics using statistical graphics and other data visualization methods. We will try to predict behaviors attributes to retain bank customers on the target variable in the given dataset. 3 ANALYSIS a href toc class btn btn primary btn sm role button aria pressed true style color blue background color e9a1ed data toggle popover Table of Contents 3. Therefore the study will try to predict behaviors attributes to retain bank customers. However overall below abs 1 seems acceptable for the linear models. Therefore a swarm plot is a great way of demonstrating and assessing the distribution of an attribute or the joint distribution of a couple of attributes. 1 LIBRARIES NEEDED IN THE STUDY a href toc class btn btn primary btn sm role button aria pressed true style color blue background color e9a1ed data toggle popover Table of Contents First if you do NOT have the following libraries in your kernel just install them since you have to need them to import some libraries. isactivemember Binary Flag for indicating if the client is active or not with the bank before the moment where the client exits the company recorded in the variable exited exited Binary flag 1 if the customer closed account with bank and 0 if the customer is retained. 2 Loading the Model Scaler a href toc class btn btn primary btn sm role button aria pressed true style color blue background color e9a1ed data toggle popover Table of Contents 7. 4 Dummy Operation a href toc class btn btn primary btn sm role button aria pressed true style color blue background color e9a1ed data toggle popover Table of Contents Before constructing our model we should convert categorical features into dummies. We will make classification on the target variable exited. 7 Descriptive Statistics 4. Otherwise you may be limiting the score with the value you give. 3 Handling With Missing Values a href toc class btn btn primary btn sm role button aria pressed true style color blue background color e9a1ed data toggle popover Table of Contents Missing data or missing values is defined as the data value that is not stored for a variable in the observation of interest. 1 Train Test Split Operations 5. 1 Context a href toc class btn btn primary btn sm role button aria pressed true style color blue background color e9a1ed data toggle popover Table of Contents Each row represents a bank customer each column contains customer s attributes described on the column Metadata. Along with the number of data points it also provides their respective distribution. 2 The Evaluation of ROC and AUC for Model with class_weigth 6. Moreover we used binary_crossentropy as the loss metric since the output is binary and relu is used in hidden layers since learning usually happens faster. 2 Loading the Model Scaler 7. 7 Descriptive Statistics a href toc class btn btn primary btn sm role button aria pressed true style color blue background color e9a1ed data toggle popover Table of Contents 5 DATA PREPROCESSING a href toc class btn btn primary btn sm role button aria pressed true style color blue background color e9a1ed data toggle popover Table of Contents First let s import related libraries. In this case the tails will be heaviour than the normal distribution which means lots of outliers are present in the data. 2010 and Bryne 2010 argued that data is considered to be normal if Skewness is between 2 to 2 and Kurtosis is between 7 to 7. On the other hand it can be safely assumed that while our target variable of exited demonstrates a slight negative correlation with the variables of creditscore tenure numberofproducts hascrcard and isactivemember it demonstrates slight positive correlation with the variables of age balance and estimatedsalary.

It can be recognized as thin bell shaped distribution with peak higher than normal distribution. 2 About The Features a href toc class btn btn primary btn sm role button aria pressed true style color blue background color e9a1ed data toggle popover Table of Contents The features in the given dataset are rownumber Row Numbers from 1 to 10000. In case of platykurtic bell shaped distribution will be broader and peak will be lower than the mesokurtic. As such the reader will be familiar with what the data can tell. Interpreting Kurtosis 2.

The problem of missing data is relatively common in almost all research and can have a significant effect on the conclusions that can be drawn from the data. tenure The number of years for which the customer has been with the bank. 0 is our threshold limit to evaluate kurtosis. When we examine the distribution of related features in the swarm plot it s in general clear that that bank costemers between the ages of 45 and 65 for male female and in geography where they live leave the bank closed their accounts. Therefore it is important to choose the appropriate value for patience. 4 of customers who represent 2037 people out of 10000 didn t show loyalty to the company and got churned while 79. As we will see later our target variable has imbalanced data For that reason we are not going to use Accuracy score Based on the problem on the hand we will use Recall score.

Each row in the data table is represented by a marker whose position depends on its values in the columns set on the X Y and Z axes.

Leptokurtic If the kurtosis is greater than 3 then it is leptokurtic. In our analysis we tried the values of 10 15 and 20 for patience however we picked up 20 since giving better results. You need to analyze frequency distributions of features relationships and correlations between the independent variables and the dependent variable. 3 7 Final Model Model Deployment 7 7.
