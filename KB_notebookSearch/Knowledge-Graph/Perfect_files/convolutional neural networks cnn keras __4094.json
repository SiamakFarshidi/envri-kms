Full connectionSoftmax Cross entropy IMPLEMENTATION1. Just seeing how many wrong predictions the classifier made is not enough to evaluate the performance of ANNs. Convolutional Neural Networks CNN KerasCreated by Sangwook CheonDate Dec 31 2018Updated Jun 27 2019This is step by step guide to Convolutional Neural Network CNN which I created for reference. And in each folder cat images and dog images should be placed in two separate folders. So after applying convolution operation to images than pooling is applied. There should be two folders Test set and Train set. import libraries we are not importing libraries used for csv files as keras deals with all of these images are two dimensional. Max PoolingTake a 2 x 2 box on the top left corner starting here and record the maximum number within the box. Softmax Cross entropySoftmax function brings all predicted values to be between 0 and 1 and make them add up to 1. It also comes hand in hand with cross entropy method. In this way keras will understand how to work with them. io preprocessing image. Videos are three dimenstional with time. initialize the classifier CNN Please note that there is another way to build a mode Functional API. Add more convolutional layers This will allow more features to be detected prior to fitting to ANN. Flattening should be at the end of all the layers. Stride is the number of pixels with which we slide the detector. Instead Cross Entropy should be used to measure how good the model is as there can be two models that produce same results while one produced better percentages than the other. ReLUAfter feature detectors are applied upon images ReLU is used to increase non linearity within images. This notebook s content is from A Z Datascience course and I hope this will be useful to those who want to review materials covered or anyone who wants to learn the basics of CNN. But when using CPU 3 64 64 due to computational limitation Max Pooling create a pooling layer 2 x 2 size commonly used to keep much information. Make predictions and determine accuracy Below are key concepts used in Convolutional Neural Networks. 256 256 3 3 color channels RGB 256 x 256 pixels. Compile the model 3. Aim of max pooling is to keep all the important features even if images have spatial or textual distortions and also reduce the size which prevents overfitting. Build the CNN model 2. If you found this helpful please upvote the kernel or put a short comment below. Convolution operation2. I added some useful notes along the way to clarify things. Convolution OperationThe aim of convolution operation is to reduce the size of an image by using feature detectors that keep only the specific patterns within the image. 3 x 3 feature detector is commonly used but other sizes can be used. We will create a dog vs cat classifier. Fit the model on images image preprocessingData augmentation prevents overfitting by generating more samples of the images through flipping rotating distorting etc. Make sure to not include input_dim and include MaxPooling step. no parameters needed. Content Explanation1. Repaet this step until all the pixels are evaluated. Other pooling techniques are also available such as Mean Pooling which takes the average of pixels within the box. Keras has built in Image Augmentation function. Add more fully connected layer hidden layers Catches more complex behaviors Thank you for reading this kernel. For classificaion Cross Entropy should be used and for regression Mean Squared Error should be used. If it is one we are moving it one pixel each time and recording the value adding up all the multiplied values. Compile and fit the model4. Many feature detectors are used and the algorithm finds out what is the optimal way to filter images. To be able to work with keras library we need proper structure of images. FlatteningFlatten the matrix into a long vector which will be the input to the artificial neural network Full ConnectionImplement full Artificial Neural Network model to optimize weights. To learn more about this function refer to this guide https keras. Flattening creating a long vector. applying convolution operation build the convolutional layer 32 3 3 32 filters with 3 x 3 for each filter. classic ANN full connection common practice number of hidden nodes between the number of input nodes and output nodes and choose powers of 2 Data augmentation. Improving the modelThere are two possible ways of reducing variane which is making the model fit more to the train set. Build the Keras model3.
