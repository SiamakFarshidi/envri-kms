As a result one of the common pre processing steps for automatic aggressiveness grading is to delineate the exact regions of IDC inside of a whole mount slide. Each patch s file name is of the format u_xX_yY_classC. The original dataset consisted of 162 whole mount slide images of Breast Cancer BCa specimens scanned at 40x. Where u is the patient ID 10253_idx5 X is the x coordinate of where this patch was cropped from Y is the y coordinate of where this patch was cropped from and C indicates the class where 0 is non IDC and 1 is IDC. Invasive Ductal Carcinoma Classifier Invasive Ductal Carcinoma IDC is the most common subtype of all breast cancers. Dataset Model Predictions of the validation data ROC curve ROC area. To assign an aggressiveness grade to a whole mount sample pathologists typically focus on the regions which contain the IDC. png example 10253_idx5_x1351_y1101_class0.
