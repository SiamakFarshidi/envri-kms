Convolution Layer Using the same metric targeted initialization Let s look at the schematic again at this point. png Copying the styles corresponding to coarse spatial resolutions brings high level aspects such as pose general hair style face shape and eyeglasses from source B while all colors eyes hair lighting and finer facial features resemble source A. png The noise layer receives the channels and returns the channels to which the noise is applied. This process is chained sequentially and occurs one after another. Generator Mapping Network sampling latent z gaussian distribution return w vector style information is contained in w 3 b. Image Generation using Stylegan pre trained modelIn this kernel I will focus on trying out a pre trained stylegan model. Activation function relu lrelu Enable equalized learning rate Enable pixelwise feature vector normalization Enable instance normalization Data type to use for activations and outputs. I added some test code and refined the structure. png TEST CODE 2 e. The new generator improves the state of the art in terms of traditional distribution quality metrics leads to demonstrably better interpolation properties and also better disentangles the latent factors of variation. upscaling layerStep 3. generator synthesis networkStep 4. convolution layer 2 c. stylegan captured this core style through the mapping network and we confirmed this through the interpolation results. com 2019 02 e18489e185b3e1848fe185b3e18485e185b5e186abe18489e185a3e186ba 2019 02 24 e1848be185a9e18492e185ae 5. first random latent vector generate first image 6 b. Thanks to lernapparat for the nice code sharing. Noise Layer image https bloglunit. Generator Synthesis Network Step 4. That have showed how high the degree of freedom is in other words the low degree of feature separation It is said to be entangled. ipynb as the base code. The results through the MLP mapping network are as follows. requires_grad True He init this is the fused upscale conv from StyleGAN sadly this seems incompatible with the non fused way this really needs to be cleaned up and go into the conv. com sw song lernapparat blob master style_gan pytorch_style_gan. Design Layers 2 a. net publication 343021405 figure fig3 AS 915394470625280 1595258457162 Generator architecture of the StyleGAN neural network 1. float32 0 trainable False dtype normalization to 0 1 range drop batch 4dim 3dim drop batch 4dim 3dim We can extract mapping network like this. Design Networks 3 a. image https www. Linear Layer With this Class Targeted initialization is performed for each layer. generator synthesis blocks 3 c. We ll use PyTorch more simply. Output resolution. show samples Step 6. Upscaling Layer Step 3. It s so much more natural Here we can see the strengths of stylegan. also this quadruples the weight average here is a little trick if you get all the noiselayers and set each modules. linear layer 2 b. Very useful for analysis style batch_size n_channels 2 batch_size 2 n_channels. To quantify interpolation quality and disentanglement we propose two new automated methods that are applicable to any generator architecture. half z half z 6 d. expand kernel channels Broadcast called const in tf tweak gain to match the official implementation of Progressing GAN 2 res x 2 res res 3. Input Disentangled latents W minibatch num_layers dlatent_size. StyleGAN Use machine learning to generate and customize realistic images https heartbeat. pixel normalization layer 2 f. pdf paper https openaccess. data flow z to image If latent z is put into g_mapping network w is returned and if the returned w is put into g_synthesis an image is created. Therefore understanding of the background knowledge of gan should be preceded and it is good to check in advance how stylegan is implemented through the official TensorFlow code. PyTorch GAN Basic Tutorial for beginner https www. log2 feature map reduction when doubling the resolution. style modification layer 2 e. second random latent vector generate second image 6 c. data flow z to image 4 b.

Enable style inputs First layer is a learned constant Enable noise inputs True randomize noise inputs every time non deterministic False read noise inputs from variables. So let s get started. half w half w By the way we actually have a w vector that passed through the G_mapping network. Pixel Normalization Layer 2 f. png The generator in a traditional GAN vs the one used by NVIDIA in the StyleGAN Index Step 1. Control Latent Vector 6 a. then let s convert to image half half Yes I think this looks more like a half half And It is a really surprising result that it is estimated to be in the middle even by age. Overall multiplier for the number of feature maps. Image Interpolation Comparison Step 1. pdf Main Reference1. He init Equalized learning rate and custom learning rate multiplier. Test the Model 5 a. probably applying a conv on w would be more efficient. com content_CVPR_2019 papers Karras_A_Style Based_Generator_Architecture_for_Generative_Adversarial_Networks_CVPR_2019_paper. Low pass filter to apply when resampling activations. get_variable lod initializer np. It allows generator to follow the targeted style distribution.
