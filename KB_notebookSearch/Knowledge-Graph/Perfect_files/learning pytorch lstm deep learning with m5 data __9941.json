Lets see the shape of our data Pytorch Tensors Pytorch use tensors as the input to the model Variable is a wrapper to the tensor This kernel is only a preliminary starter So I use the Variable wrapperA more common way is to train with batches and use the dataset classBut this is for later. The course use Keras and TensorFlow but it provides a good starting point for this topic Link https www. The goal of normalization is to change the values of numeric columns in the dataset to use a common scale without distorting differences in the ranges of values. You can read all the details about the LSTM Versus RNN at the link I provided above The picture of one cell is taken from that blog. The Model has one LST layer and one dense input layer.

It is the layer that will automatically create multiple LSTM layer and it seems that it uses more efficiently the Cuda drivers you can see more in this discussion https discuss. It is required only when features have different rangesor scales. com kyakovlev m5 simple feAlso I have learned alot from this Pytorch LSTM kernel https www. JPG Rolling window is some calculation over a window example mean rollwindow. com pytorch examples tree master time_sequence_prediction Main Steps These are the main steps for building a Time Series Prediction Model image. com omershect learning pytorch seq2seq with m5 data set Versions Version 1 2 First Draft. com how to develop lstm models for time series forecasting Pytorch Basic example This is a simple example of how to build a Pytorch LSTM network for simple Univariate Time Series. There are great kernel here mostly using the boosting models the most popular is LightGBM And I have learned how to prepare the data and use it with this popular model. io posts 2015 08 Understanding LSTMs Post about building Time Series deep learning The post cover the Keras TensorFlow framework but it also gives a great overview of the main concepts and how to prepare the data. Rolling windows For rolling windows we will use mean and std standard deviation The lags and rolling windows created Nan values When I tried to train with Nan values the loss was also Nan Need further understanding but for now I will replace the Nan by zero NormalizeDue to the multi dimension we need to adjust We can normalize the full Data Frame. png attachment image. JPG attachment LSTMnet2. It is a basic course that provides a preliminary overview of the concept And building models to Univariate Time series. However we need to do dummy normalize to our target the sales as our prediction will be 1D Day Of the Week This article https medium. If you want to learn more about Tensors Read this tutorial https pytorch. It is easier to implement using data frame Lag is just shifting the sales demand. JPG The Basic idea of Time Series prediction and RNN Recurrent Neural Network is to re arrange the data into windows of sequences and labels. JPG Features can be lags or rolling windows. JPG attachment daysweek. Lag features Plot LagsLet s Plot our lags it is a bit hard to see the small lags as the Time Series containing few years but for the longer lags such as 365 we can see the shift. JPG attachment rollwindow. Moving forwards I have decided to learn a bit more about the use of deep learning for Time Series prediction. So the first kernel is only trying to explain the basic idea using an arbitrary series from the M5 data. I do have a background from other competition with deep learning but for image vision working mostly with Pytorch. The first models are not so demanding so you can still use CPU training but it will be slower. In our case we have sequences of 28 days that will use to predict the next day. If you like my kernel Please Vote If You like this kernel Here a similar one with Seq2Seq model https www. png Load Libraries GPU use Since this is a deep learning model The use of GPU will accelerate the training. There are multiple methods to do this hold one off Cross Validation but for Time Series this needs careful and gentile planning. org learn tensorflow sequences time series and prediction home welcome LSTM networks Great post Blog that explains the concept beyond LSTM networks Link https colah. JPG The following parameters are provided to the net Num classes is the number of output in this case 1 Input size we don t use batch so we have one input of 28 samples Hidden layers number of hidden layer in each cell the more is better but also will slow down the training Num layers we have one layer of LSTM layer we will increase it Predict on Entire Data Set Test RMSE Multiple LSTM layers We can Enhance the net by using multiple LSTM layers. com davidheffernan_99410 an introduction to using categorical embeddings ee686ed7e7f9I have decided to try it as is on the day of the week So I will add four vectors which describe the days of the week daysweek. JPG To use the day of the week we will merge data from the calendar DF Let s Compare one example again to verify that the normalization was done properly Multi Dimensional Sliding WindowCreate the sliding window data set Pytorch Tensor LSTM model The model is similar to the previous one with some enhancement at the output layers Training Some enhancement we save the best model based on the lowest validation loss Predict RMSE Test What Next Add more features Calculate WRMSE Change Loss function Train MultiVarient series Use batches Add Convolotional Network Use Cross Validiation Create Submission If you like the kernel please vote and this will encourage me to post more Also I am happy to get comments or things that I need to fix. JPG We create a sliding window which builds sequences and labels. JPG Note that Pytorch has the nn. Link https github. org tutorials beginner former_torchies tensor_tutorial. JPG Or in a more schematic ilustriation TS1. To go deeper and learn the topic I have decided to build a learning kernel that at least at the beginning will explain the topic and the concepts the definition and the basics From my experience when you try to explain to others you learn the most. htmlWe also split the data to train and testing or validation sets. Normalizes our data using the min max scaler with minimum and maximum values of 1 and 1 respectivelyIf we print some of the examples we can see that the values are now between 1 and 1 Plot The distribution Plot the distribution before and after the Normalization. I hope that the next versions will go deeper and I can provide a full submission with deep learning. For simplicity at this stage We will split the data for the training set and a test setSo we got 1262 sets of 28 samples each as the features X and 1262 labels as our target y in the training set 622 sets of 28 samples with 622 labels in our tests set You can see that in Pytorch the tensor dimensions are opposite to the NumPy dimensions Simple LSTM model In this section we create the Pytorch LSTM model. JPG attachment Features. JPG Now we can start again with the selected Time Series Add some features and modify a bit our model and training. LSTM function and nn. For this example I will use a window or a sequence of 28 samples 28 days So the data should look like this series. For machine learning every dataset does not require normalization. As you can see we kept the distribution of the data but we change its scales. Link https machinelearningmastery.
