The direct impression is that the dynamic range is small and the contrast is poor on the contrary if the histogram is evenly extended to In the entire distribution area the contrast of the image will be very strong. Histogram equalization is to stretch the image non linearly and redistribute the image pixel values so that the number of pixels within a certain grayscale range is approximately the same.

JPG If the histogram pixels of an image are distributed in a very narrow range then under normal circumstances the effect of the image will be very bad. The central idea of the histogram equalization processing is to change the grayscale histogram of the original image from a relatively concentrated grayscale interval to a uniform distribution in the entire grayscale range.
