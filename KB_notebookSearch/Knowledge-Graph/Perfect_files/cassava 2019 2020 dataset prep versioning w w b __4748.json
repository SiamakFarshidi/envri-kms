Here K 5 Uses Weights and Biases for dataset version control. COLOR_RGB2BGR Fix incorrect colors get label get TFRecord example Decode image from TFRecord file. change image_id to path_to_image_id for ease. 5 improvement in score can win you a gold medal. If we use cross validation training train and validation split will have same data distribution which is crucial for accurate evaluation of model performance. png Now we will use these folds and convert them to TFRecord files of different sizes. IncludesThis kernel builds TFRecord dataset to be used for Cassava Leaf Disease Classification Challenege. You can store entire datasets directly in artifacts or use artifact references to point to data in other systems. tfrec file containing similar data distribution. And they can be downloaded to ensure reproducibility using the code snippet which you can find in the API tab as shown in the image below. com cross validation for imbalanced classification train and validation split to train image classifiers. Cassava 2019 Dataset Save as W B Artifact for dataset versioning III. Save as W B Artifact for dataset versioningYou can visit the W B project page and click on the Artifact s icon. The square box is the job type dataset creation train evaluate etc. Note We are going to use K 16. com watch v Hd94gatGMic list PLD80i8An1OEGajeVo15ohAQYF1Ttle0lk index 3 as well. In this notebook we will create a Stratified K Fold https machinelearningmastery. get image names within the dir_name get label create dataframe BytesList won t unpack a string from an EagerTensor. com ayuraj efficientnet mixup k fold using tf and wandb. If you want to use the dataset use this code snippet import wandbrun wandb. Cassava 2019 2020 Stratified K Fold SplitStratified K Fold ensures that every split will have similar data distribution which is crucial from an imbalanced dataset point of view. png Use the TFRecord DatasetIn order to use the dataset created use this code snippet import wandbrun wandb. We merged both the dataset during job dataset_merge. Imports and Setups Prepare Dataset I. png attachment image. Cassava 2020 Dataset Save as W B Artifact for dataset versioning II. Hence it can be used for Stratified K Fold training. It s situated at the left hand panel. The final preview of the graph view of the dataset versioning. Write TFRecords Utils Generate TFRecords Save as W B Artifact for dataset versioning Visualize For Sanity CheckWe will use this dataset to train an image classifier. Check out this YouTube tutorial https www. This dataset can be used for cross validation training pipeline for image classification. com ayuraj efficientnet mixup k fold using tf and wandb will showcase the use W B artifacts to download the dataset and train the model. Uses Datset from Cassava Leaf Disease Classification Challenge 2019. Since we are modifying and creating new csv files containing image_id and label it s important to incorporate dataset version control in the dataset creating pipeline. We created two artifacts raw_2019 and raw_2020 using two different jobs called dataset_creation. download The training notebook https www. The resulting artifact is cassava_2019_2020. data dataset automatically interleaves reads from multiple files. The resulting artifact is cassava_folds. read csv and extract image paths and labels make destination dir get image img cv2. Screenshot 20 2842 29. Here s a preview of the graph view of the dataset versioning. TFRecords for each fold. We then did Stratified K Fold split K 16 during job dataset_split. At this point each artifact is storing csv files. png attachment Screenshot 20 2842 29. This is particularly useful for competitions like these where. Each split will be converted to TFRecord. The round circle is the stored artifact. I will be using this training kernel https www. NoteThis kernel is producing TFRecords with each. Learn more about W B artifacts here https docs. Read the TFRecord file. Quick introduction on Weights and Biases ArtifactsYou can use W B Artifacts to store and keep track of datasets models and evaluation results across machine learning pipelines. Function to plot the distribution of the dataset. We will again rely on artifacts for version control and monitoring. I have used Weights and Biases to show Dataset version control with Weights and Biases https wandb. Think of an artifact as a versioned folder of data. It can be dataset model files results etc. ", "id": "ayuraj/cassava-2019-2020-dataset-prep-versioning-w-w-b", "size": "4748", "language": "python", "html_url": "https://www.kaggle.com/code/ayuraj/cassava-2019-2020-dataset-prep-versioning-w-w-b", "git_url": "https://www.kaggle.com/code/ayuraj/cassava-2019-2020-dataset-prep-versioning-w-w-b", "script": "train_test_split load_dataset show_label_distribution functools numpy seaborn decode_image _int64_feature tensorflow StratifiedKFold matplotlib.pyplot kaggle_secrets sklearn.model_selection pandas TFRecordWriter serialize_example partial read_tfrecord UserSecretsClient _float_feature show_batch _bytes_feature ", "entities": "(('TFRecord dataset', 'Cassava Leaf Disease Classification Challenege'), 'build') (('which', 'view'), 'Cassava') (('You', 'other systems'), 'store') (('Fix incorrect colors', 'TFRecord file'), 'COLOR_RGB2BGR') (('you', 'code snippet import wandbrun wandb'), 'want') (('This', 'these'), 'be') (('We', 'version control'), 'rely') (('wandb', 'model'), 'mixup') (('artifact', 'csv files'), 'store') (('versioningYou', 'icon'), 'save') (('it', 'pipeline'), 's') (('split', 'TFRecord'), 'convert') (('png', 'code snippet import wandbrun wandb'), 'Use') (('Here K', 'version dataset control'), 'Uses') (('Hence it', 'Stratified K Fold training'), 'use') (('data dataset', 'multiple files'), 'read') (('Stratified K then Fold', 'job 16 dataset_split'), 'do') (('com ayuraj efficientnet', 'tf'), 'mixup') (('png Now we', 'different sizes'), 'use') (('which', 'model performance'), 'have') (('Here preview', 'dataset versioning'), 's') (('TFRecords Save', 'image classifier'), 'write') (('I', 'training kernel https www'), 'use') (('dataset', 'image classification'), 'use') (('ArtifactsYou', 'evaluation machine learning pipelines'), 'introduction') (('Dataset Cassava 2019 Save', 'III'), 'versione') (('com cross validation', 'image classifiers'), 'split') (('We', 'two different jobs'), 'create') (('kernel', 'each'), 'produce') (('you', 'image'), 'download') (('We', 'job dataset_merge'), 'merge') (('5 improvement', 'gold medal'), 'win') (('dir', 'image img cv2'), 'read') (('I', 'https Weights wandb'), 'use') (('label create dataframe BytesList', 'EagerTensor'), 'get') (('we', 'Stratified K Fold https machinelearningmastery'), 'create') "}
