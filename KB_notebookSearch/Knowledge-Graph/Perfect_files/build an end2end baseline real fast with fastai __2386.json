InferencePrediction looks not good for now but we submit it anyway. Build an End2End baseline REAL FAST with fastai summary. You don t need to define neither datasets nor dataloaders by yourself. Defining model is done Before starting training let s find better learning rate. Loading metadataThis is baseline so we only care about Id column which guild us to the filepath of the input images. get_y Label is provided in Pawpularity column of train. All you need to do is just selecting class and function for DataBlock parameters from fastai reference. PreparationFirst of all import EVERYTHING with ONE line. It s ok to use because fastai module automatically select what we need. item_tfms batch_tfms tfms means transform you can specify some transform you want to apply. Now we have DataBlock that works. Now we know good learning rate then let s train the model fastai s learner has function to execute fine tuning pretrained with ImageNet. Dataloaders are done TrainingNow let s define a model and check if the model can process data to the output. test_dl and let the learner predicts. That means you should select ImageBlock and RegressionBlock for blocks get_x Image path is provided in Id column of train. blocks At this competition we predict numerical value called Pawpularity from image. Defining DataBlock As mentioned before we don t need to define neither datasets nor dataloaders. You can give image path to the DataBlock by defining function that takes a row from dataframe and returns filepath. You can give label to the DataBlock by defining function like we did for get_x parameter. splitter Here you can specify how to split train data and valid data. You don t have to freeze the model s weights explicitly. To do that we give filepath to learn. Let s get dataloaders from DataBlock then check what their batch have.
