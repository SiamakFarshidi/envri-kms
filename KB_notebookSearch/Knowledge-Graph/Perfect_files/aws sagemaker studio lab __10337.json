To get help or access documentation click on the Help menu in the menu bar at the top of the page. Learn how to use ML with the learn at your own pace MLU Accelerator learning series. First save your work and then navigate back to your project overview page to select the instance type you want. org pandas https pandas. First you can open the Terminal and directly create a new environment using the Conda command line conda env create name my_environment python 3. To run the following Python code select the cell with a click and then type Shift Enter on your keyboard or click the play button in the notebook toolbar at the top of the document. org so you don t need to add the c conda forge argument when calling conda install. so each time you launch your project you can pick up where you left off. Managing packages and Conda environments Your default environmentSageMaker Studio Lab uses Conda environments to encapsulate the software Python R etc. png To activate any Conda environment in the Terminal run conda activate my_environment Once you do this any pakcages installed using Conda or pip will be installed in that environment. org stable PyTorch https pytorch. io en latest or pip https pip. Note that a GPU runtime session is limited to 4 hours and a CPU runtime session is limited to 12 hours of continuous use. org and TensorFlow https www. To install these extensions open the Terminal and activate the studiolab environment conda activate studiolab Then you can install the relevant JupyterLab or Jupyter Server extension conda install You will need to refresh your page to pickup any JupyterLab extensions you have installed or power cycle your project runtime to pickup any Jupyter server extensions. To add an Open in Studio Lab badge to your README. You can do this by clicking on the button at the top of the file browser in the left panel to open the Launcher Launcher Button images launcher_button. Installing JupyterLab and Jupyter Server extensionsSageMaker Studio Lab enables you to install open source JupyterLab and Jupyter Server extensions. Your project contains a default Conda environment named default with the IPython kernel https ipython. com machine learning mlu provides anybody anywhere at any time access to the same machine learning courses used to train Amazon s own developers on machine learning. With tens of millions of online page views D2L has been adopted for teaching by over 300 universities from 55 countries including Stanford MIT Harvard and Cambridge. packages needed to run notebooks. With over 150 Jupyter notebooks D2L provides a comprehensive overview of deep learning principles and a state of the art introduction to deep learning in computer vision and natural language processing. SageMaker Studio Lab is based on the open source JupyterLab so you can take advantage of open source Jupyter extensions in your project. Adding Open in Studio Lab links to your GitHub repositoriesIf you have public GitHub repositories with Jupyter Notebooks you can make it easy for other users to open these notebooks in SageMaker Studio Lab by adding an Open in Studio Lab link to a README. Creating and using new Conda environmentsThere are a couple of ways of creating new Conda environments. To help you take the next steps we have a GitHub repository with a set of example notebooks that cover a wide range of data science and machine learning topics from importing and cleaning data to data visualization and training machine learning models. Notebooks enable you to combine live code equations Markdown images visualizations and other content into a single document that you can share with other people. md file use the following markdown Open In Studio Lab https studiolab. To learn more about Python see The Python Tutorial https docs. There are a couple of ways to install additional packages into this environment. co transformers library and state of the art natural language processing speech and computer vision models. Running Python codeThis Getting Started document is a Jupyter notebook https jupyter. ai is an open source interactive book that teaches the ideas the mathematical theory and the code that powers deep learning. You can navigate back to your project page by selecting the Open Project Overview Page in the Amazon SageMaker Studio Lab menu. Getting Started with Amazon SageMaker Studio Lab Welcome to your SageMaker Studio Lab projectYour SageMaker Studio Lab project is a notebook development environment with 25 GB of persistent storage and access to a CPU or GPU runtime. Switching the runtime will stop all your kernels but all of your notebooks files and datasets will be saved in your persistent project directory. co is the home of the Transformers https huggingface. io en stable command lines conda install pip install The conda installation for SageMaker Studio Lab uses a default channel of conda forge https conda forge. io en stable and that is about it. Alternatively you can open the Terminal and activate the environment using conda activate default Once the environment is activated you can install packages using the Conda https docs. As described above you can use the following magic commands in any notebook conda install pip install These magic commands will always install packages into the environment used by that notebook and any packages you install are saved in your persistent project directory. 9 This example creates an new environment named my_environment with Python 3. Or in HTML This will creates a badge like Open In SageMaker Studio Lab https studiolab. Clone Hugging Face Notebooks Switching to a GPU runtimeDepending on the kinds of algorithms you are using you may want to switch to a GPU or a CPU runtime for faster computation. Alternatively if you have a Conda environment file can right click on the file in the JupyterLab file browser and select the Build Conda Environment item Create Environment images create_environment. Note we don t recommend using pip or conda as those can behave in unexpected ways when you have multiple environments. Clone SageMaker Studio Lab Example Notebooks AWS Machine Learning University Machine Learning University MLU https aws. Clone MLU Notebooks Dive into Deep Learning D2L Dive into Deep Learning D2L https www. ipynb and replace org repo the path and the notebook filename with those for your repo. png In the Launcher there are a set of cards that allow you to launch notebooks in different environments create source code files or access the Terminal Launcher Cards images launcher_cards. Installing Python packagesThe simplest way of installing Python packages is to use either of the following magic commands in a code cell of a notebook conda install pip install These magic commands will always install packages into the environment used by that notebook and any packages you install are saved in your persistent project directory. To use your new Conda environments with notebooks make sure the ipykernel package is installed into that environment conda install ipykernel Once installed ipykernel you should see a card in the launcher for that environment and kernel after about a minute. Here is an example that shows how to install NumPy into the environment used by this notebook Now you can use NumPy SageMaker Studio Lab example notebooksSageMaker Studio Lab works with familiar open source data science and machine learning libraries such as NumPy https numpy. png All of the notebooks files and datasets that you create are saved in your persistent project directory and are available when you open your project. This allows anyone to quickly preview the notebook and import it into their SageMaker Studio Lab project. aws import github org repo blob master path to notebook. svg https studiolab.
