The concept of Knowledge Graphs borrows from the Graph Theory. read_csv import wikipedia sentences dependency tag of previous token in the sentence previous token in the sentence if token is a punctuation mark then move on to the next token check token is a compound word or not if the previous word was also a compound then add the current word to it check token is a modifier or not if the previous word was also a compound then add the current word to it update variables Matcher class object define the pattern extract subject extract object create a directed graph from a dataframe k regulates the distance between nodes. Let s start with the relation composed by Since writing is an important role in any movie I would like to visualize the graph for the written by relation Let s see the knowledge graph of another important predicate i. What is a Knowledge GraphA Knowledge Graph is a set of data points connected by relations that describe a domain for instance a business an organization or a field of study. It becomes really hard to visualize a graph with these many relations or predicates. png attachment 0_ntSr1qbO 9nq20JD. In this particular representation we store data as 0_ntSr1qbO 9nq20JD. Usually these types of graphs is modeled with triples which are sets of three items like subject verb object with the verb being the relationship between the subject and the object for example London is_capital England. It is a powerful way of representing data because Knowledge Graphs can be built automatically and can then be explored to reveal new insights about the domain. So it s advisable to use only a few important relations to visualize a graph. Of course in a real world knowledge graph there are lots of entities and relationships and there is more than one way to arrive at one entity starting from another. Entity Pairs ExtractionTo build a knowledge graph the most important things are the nodes and the edges between them. Relation Predicate Extraction Build a Knowledge GraphWell this is not exactly what we were hoping for still looks quite a sight though. I will take one relation at a time. It turns out that we have created a graph with all the relations that we had.
