Building CNN architecture using keras 3. 2 Normalizing data 2. The non linear activation function will help the model to understand the complexity and give accurate results. 3 optimizer Learning Rate SchedulesLearning rate schedules seek to adjust the learning rate during training by reducing the learning rate according to a pre defined schedule. Common learning rate schedules include time based decay step decay and exponential decay Here we will implement Step Decay Step decay schedule drops the learning rate by a factor every few epochs. 2 Data Augmentation datagen_train ImageDataGenerator width_shift_range 0. shape 0 callbacks checkpointer lrate verbose 1 model Evaluation 4. 4 Label Encoding 2. 3 confusion matrix Refrences 1. The weigts of Kernel are randomly initialize and later it learn them. The window that moves over the image is called a kernel. learning rate schedules and adaptive learning rate methods for deep learning https towardsdatascience. 5 Now we will split training data into training data and validation data 3. Introduction to CNN with keras 1. For example max pooling uses the maximum value from each of a cluster of neurons at the prior layer. 1 plotting training and validation loss 4. Introduction to Convolution Neural network https adeshpande3. At each position the 3x3 visits you matrix multiply element wise the values of your 3x3 window by the values in the image that are currently being covered by the window and it also passes through RELU Activation. 3 Reshape 2. layer 1 is input layer. 3 optimizer and Learning Rate scheduler 4. There are several kinds of non linear activation functions like Sigmoid Tanh ReLU and leaky ReLU. jpg For more detail Convolutional Neural Networks http cs231n. 2 randomly shift images horizontally height_shift_range 0. fit_generator datagen_train. flow X_train Y_train batch_size 16 validation_data X_valid Y_valid epochs 10 steps_per_epoch X_train. 3 Reshape Reshaping image into 3D matrix 2. The main function of it is to introduce non linear properties into the network. This results in a single number the represents all the values in that window of the image. visualize convolutional neural network http www. The distance the window moves each time is called the stride. Define Model 3. Another is average pooling which uses the average value from each of a cluster of neurons at the prior layer. Displaying output of layer 4 Displaying output of layer 8 4. introduction 2. Model Evaluation 4. pooling layer Convolutional networks may include local or global pooling layers which combine the outputs of neuron clusters at one layer into a single neuron in the next layer. 3 confusion matrix 1. Imagine you have an image represented as a 5x5 matrix of values and you take a 3x3 matrix and slide that 3x3 window around the image. 1 loading data visualizing the number of different labels in traing data 2. 2 randomly shift images vertically horizontal_flip True randomly flip images horizontally fit augmented image generator on datadatagen_train. 2 plotting training and validation accuracy Visualize CNN Layers Displaying original Image Desplaying above image after layer 2. CNN Architecure 3. Types Of Activation Functions In Neural Networks And Rationale Behind It https i. 5 splitting into training and validation data 3. png A CNN is a neural network that typically contains several types of layers one of which is a convolutional layer as well as pooling and activation layers. Data preparation 2. com learning rate schedules and adaptive learning rate methods for deep learning 2c8f433990d1 define SGD optimizer compile the model Convert predictions classes to one hot vectors Convert validation observations to one hot vectors compute the confusion matrix predict results select the indix with the maximum probability. 2 Normalization 2. io convolutional networks Activation layer Activation functions are important for a Artificial Neural Network to learn and understand the complex patterns. What it does is it calculates the weighted sum and adds direction and decides whether to fire a particular neuron or not. 2 Data Augmentation 3. The mathematical form of step decay is lr lr0 drop floor epoch epochs_drop we will drop learning rate after every 3 epochs above we have not run our model with augmented data we can run our model model with augmentated data like below model. convolutional layer The Conv layer is the core building block of a Convolutional Network that does most of the computational heavy lifting.
