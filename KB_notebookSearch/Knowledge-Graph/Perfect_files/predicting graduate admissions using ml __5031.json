GRE Score vs Chance of Admit GRE scores have a strong correlation with the chance of admission however not as strong as one s CGPA. Quantitative Reasoning Scored on a 130 170 scale In this dataset the GRE Score is based on a maximum of 340 points. University Rating Let s see the distribution of applicants coming from each kind of university. The university weighs certain aspects of a student s education to determine their acceptance. Preparing Data for Machine Learning Now that we understand our dataset it s time to implement machine learning methods to predict future applicant s chances of admission. Graduate Admission Analysis for UCLA Introduction Objective 400 applicants have been surveyed as potential students for UCLA. From the data shown below it appears the submissions are normally distributed. WritingAll sections are scored out of 30 giving the exam a total score of 120 marks. Research Let s explore how many applicants have research experience. It seems the majority of applicants have research experience. Let s plot a heatmap to see the correlation of all the features compared to Chance to Admit The top three features that affect the Chance to Admit are 1. Machine Learning Now we ll implement machine learning algorithms to predict the chance of admission. The methods used will be 1. Selecting the Best Algorithm 1. Linear Regression 81. For my curiosity I want to explore the data a little bit further regarding research and university rankings. TOEFL ScoreLet s explore these three features to get a better understanding. Conclusion This was a great way to get started on Kaggle and for my first project outside of coursework. GRE Score The Graduate Record Examination is a standarized exam often required for admission to graduate and MBA programs globally. The test is split up into 4 sections 1. First we have to prepare our data by splitting it into training and testing data. The objective is to explore what kind of data is provided determine the most important factors that contribute to a student s chance of admission and select the most accurate model to predict the probability of admission. TOEFL Score vs Chance of Admit Like GRE scores the scores received for the TOEFL strongly correlate to an applicants chance of admission. Verbal Reasoning Scored on a 130 170 scale 3. It gave me some practice some exploratory analysis and simple machine learning techniques. 99 It seems that Linear Regression is the most accurate of the 3 methods and will be used to predict the future applicant s chances of admission. is just an index for students which we can take out. Most applicants come from a tier 3 and tier 2 university. Data Description The dataset contains information about a student s GRE Score TOEFL Score University Ratings Statement of Purpose Score Letter of Recomendation Score CGPA Whether the Student Has Done Any Research Chance of Admission What We re Trying to Predict Importing Libraries and Data Importing libraries and setting the default style in Seaborn. Analytical Writing Scored on a 0 6 scale in half point increments 2. Even though they hold a lower importance in the chance of admission it would be nice to understand their characteristics in the dataset. Random Forests Linear Regression Decision Trees Random Forests Comparing Scores Let s put all the scores in a table and display their scores side by side. It s great to see what specific variables contribute to the chance of admission and how they are weighted against eachother. The mean is 317 with a standard deviation of 11. CGPA vs Chance of Admit It appears as applicant s CGPA has a strong correlation with their chance of admission. CGPA The Cumulative Grade Point Average is a 10 point grading system. However this is the least important feature so it doesn t matter all too much if an applicant has the experience or not. In this dataset the TOEFL scores have a mean of 107 and a standard deviation of 6. Two columns also have an added space in the label which we ll take outWe are also removing the blank sapces. We ll use multiple techniques and eventually select the method with the best score. Next let s import our dataset and see what we re working with. TOEFL Score The Test of English as a Foreign Language is a standarized test for non native English speakers that are choosing to enroll in English speaking universities. We ll also scale our data from 0 to 1 to receive more accurate predictions. 6 and standard deviation of 0. Exploratory Analysis From these charts it looks like we have no missing values It seems as though Serial No. ", "id": "adepvenugopal/predicting-graduate-admissions-using-ml", "size": "5031", "language": "python", "html_url": "https://www.kaggle.com/code/adepvenugopal/predicting-graduate-admissions-using-ml", "git_url": "https://www.kaggle.com/code/adepvenugopal/predicting-graduate-admissions-using-ml", "script": "seaborn sklearn sklearn.linear_model preprocessing matplotlib sklearn.preprocessing train_test_split LinearRegression pyplot pyplot as plt sklearn.model_selection pandas DecisionTreeRegressor sklearn.ensemble StandardScaler sklearn.tree RandomForestRegressor numpy ", "entities": "(('mean', '11'), 'be') (('We', 'Seaborn'), 'description') (('GRE scores', 'however as CGPA'), 'Score') (('Most applicants', 'tier tier 3 university'), 'come') (('s', 'side side'), 'forest') (('that', 'Chance'), 'let') (('Analytical Writing', 'half point'), 'increment') (('This', 'outside coursework'), 'Conclusion') (('how they', 'eachother'), 's') (('scores', 'admission'), 'Score') (('It', 'practice'), 'give') (('it', 'admission'), 'prepare') (('it', 'dataset'), 'be') (('s', 'university'), 'let') (('we', 'what'), 'let') (('university', 'acceptance'), 'weigh') (('Graduate Record Examination', 'MBA programs'), 'score') (('We', 'best score'), 'use') (('that', 'admission'), 'be') (('we', 'also blank sapces'), 'have') (('CGPA', 'admission'), 'CGPA') (('We', 'more accurate predictions'), 'scale') (('we', 'which'), 'be') (('submissions', 'data'), 'appear') (('Graduate Admission Analysis', 'UCLA'), 'survey') (('WritingAll sections', '120 marks'), 'score') (('that', 'speaking English universities'), 'be') (('Machine Now we', 'admission'), 'Learning') (('I', 'university little bit further research rankings'), 'want') (('how many applicants', 'research experience'), 'let') (('GRE Score', '340 points'), 'reasoning') (('Linear Regression', 'admission'), '99') (('majority', 'research experience'), 'seem') (('First we', 'data'), 'have') (('t matter all too much applicant', 'experience'), 'be') (('TOEFL scores', 'standard 6'), 'have') (('It', 'missing values'), 'Analysis') "}
