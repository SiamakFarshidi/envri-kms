There are three files Sample submission Train Test. Let s check now the train data in train_images and train_label masks folders. Gleason score 3 4Let s look now to images with Gleason score 3 4. Gleason score 5 5Let s look now to few images and associated masks for samples with Gleason score 5 5. For this visualization I reused the code from this Kernel https www. All exams with ISUP grade 4 have Gleason score 4 4 majority 3 5 or 5 3. In 2012 the International Society of Urologic Pathologists ISUP proposed a novel validated grading system for clear cell renal cell carcinoma ccRCC and papillary renal cell carcinoma pRCC that has been implemented by the World Health Organization WHO. com rohitsingh9990 panda eda better visualization 3 Dhananjay Raut PANDA EDA All you need to know https www. And intersection between train image ids and image equals train cardinality. Two research sources are present Karolinska Institute and Radboud University. Most of the 0 1 ISUP Grade samples are originated from Karolinska. Based on presence of various formations the Gleason score is given for majority first digit in the score and minority Gleason score the second digit. After the biopsy is assigned a Gleason score a combination of the two digits it is converted into an ISUP grade on a 1 5 scale using the correspondence matrix shown in the next Figure. com dhananjay3 panda eda all you need to know. All exams with ISUP grade 3 have Gleason score 4 3. Missing DataLet s check for missing values in these lists. Gleason score 3 3Let s look now to images with Gleason score 3 3. Test and sample submission csv files have only 3 rows samples. IntroductionThis Kernel objective is to explore the dataset for Prostate cANcer graDe Assessment PANDA Challenge. com article 1612022 overview 2 Rohit Singh PANDA EDA Better Visualization https www. com rohitsingh9990 panda eda better visualization Masks samplesLet s show now the masks for the same images. Most of the 2 5 ISUP Grade samples are originated from Radboud. Diagnosis of PCa is based on the grading of prostate tissue biopsies. Consequently there are 100 images with missing masks. In the next Figure we show the principle of Gleason grading system. The data is unbalanced with respect of Gleason score values distribution. In train data there is a column gleason_score that is not present either in test with image_id data_provider or in sample submission image_id isup_grade csv. For Radboud next in terms of frequency most frequent are samples with Gleason score 4 3 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 5. We can observe that there are totally 10616 train images with same number 10616 corresponding images and only 10516 mask images. All exams with ISUP grade 2 have Gleason score 3 4. The objective is to predict isup_grade for each image in test set. Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer among males worldwide that results in more than 350k deaths annually. png The grading process consists of finding and classifying cancer tissue into so called Gleason patterns 3 4 or 5 based on the architectural growth patterns of the tumor see Figure below. Data ExplorationLet s check distribution of data_provider isup_grade and gleason_score in train data. com data books 2471 murtagh7e_c114_f04. Image samplesLet s plot some image samples from train_images. Both intersections with masks set cardinality is equal with the mask set data dimmensions. Let s see what images have missing masks. The key to decreasing mortality is developing more precise screeening procedures and diagnostics. png Prepare the Data Analysis Load Packages Load the DataLet s load the tabular data. We compare now the intersections of sets of resulted lists. We can observe that all of the 0 0 Gleason score data samples are from Karolinska while from Radboud we have most of negative data. Let s check now relative distribution of ISUP grade anf Gleason score values. For Karolinska next in terms of frequency are samples with Gleason score 3 3 3 4 4 4. For this we will remove the suffix and extension from label masks and will remove the extension from image list. References 1 YiFen Zhang MD PhD Pathology Grading of Renal Cell Carcinoma https emedicine. All exams with ISUP grade 1 have Gleason score 3 3. This system is based primarily on the nucleoli assessment of the tumors as follows 1 Grade 1 Inconspicuous nucleoli at 400 magnification and basophilic Grade 2 Clearly visible nucleoli at 400 magnification and eosinophilic Grade 3 Clearly visible nucleoli at 100 magnification Grade 4 Extreme pleomorphism or rhabdoid and or sarcomatoid morphology Majority of data samples in train set have ISUP grade values 0 or 1 total 50 and the rest of the data samples have associated ISUP grades from 2 to 5 with all ranging in the 11 12 each. Gleason score 4 5Let s look now to few images and associated masks for samples with Gleason score 4 5. com kaggle media competitions PANDA Screen 20Shot 202020 04 08 20at 202. Discussion All exams with ISUP grade 0 have Gleason score 0 0 or negative. Extract image characteristicsLet s parse all images for train data to extract image characteristics. Let s see how Gleason score is grouped by Data source. Let s now represent the distribution of image dimmensions width height the spacing and level_count also related to the other features namely data_provide isup_grade and gleason_score. All exams with ISUP grade 5 have Gleason score 4 5 majority 5 4 or 5 5. This data distribution can be better visualized using a heatmap. Let s see how ISUP grade is distributed with respect of Data provider. This seems to be aligned with the correspondence matrix as shown in the following table The only misalignment is in the fact that for ISUP Grade 2 in the data we also have Gleason score 4 3 which also appears for ISUP Grade 3. That means that besides the missing 100 mask images is no missing data all images indexed in train data has corresponding tiff images and only 100 tiff label masks are missing.
