Import the necessary libraries as always. You can implement SVM RandomForest Classifier etc. For this dataset I ll be using Logistic Regression. Thank you and let me know how I can improve my explainations. Each row of the file contains pixel intensity values and the final column contains a 0 or a 1 which denotes whether there is any nuclei present in that specific picture. Check the unique entries of the output column which is in question. This is the main step to perform at the beginning of every data science or machine learning project. com b nucleolus hepatocyte liver cells hepatocytes seen light microscope their nuclei show very large stained red 93292624. Let s find out the confusion matrix and accuracy. It is clear that classification algorithms should be employed to solve this task. Let s create training and testing I O. This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed It is defined by the kaggle python docker image https github. Here the output is binary. We can go ahead and start predicting with the test dataset input. Now you might think which machine learning algorithms to use. Hello I m glad to be making this kernel for you guys. For example running this by clicking run or pressing Shift Enter will list the files in the input directory Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output. Hope you understand the steps I have laid out down below. head command to confirm the importing of data to the dataframe. Create a dataframe by importing all the values from the csv file. We have just imported the libraries required for Logistic Regression and splitting the dataset for training and testing purpose. com kaggle docker python For example here s several helpful packages to load in linear algebra data processing CSV file I O e. It depends on the ouput. This enables us to acess the data at a faster speed and also making sure the original file is safe and unchanged. Here we can see the classifier is performing at a very high accuracy. This can be imporved further by using different classification algorithms or ensemble methods. We can measure the performance of the classifier by using accuracy and confusion matrix. So let s import the library for it. Anyone with a small experience in image processing would be aware that the pictures can be represented in the form the pixel intensitites of each pixel. read_csv Input data files are available in the. Let s split the data into training and test datasets as it is important to measure the accuracy of our model with the dataset test it has not learned from. So the pixel intensities value will differ at the nuclei and the cell space. Create and define the classifier Now when the classifier is fitted with the training data it has learned the pattern from it. jpg When trying to detect nuclei in a histology picture it is clear that the nuclei is darker in color than its surroundings.
