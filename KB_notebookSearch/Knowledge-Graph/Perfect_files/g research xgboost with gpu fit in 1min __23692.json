Although data may be regularized through hyperparameter fine tuning regularized algorithms may also be attempted. That is tuning Column Sub sampling in XGBoost By Tree. For this reason I found setting a high lambda value and a low or 0 alpha value to be the most effective when regularizing. 3 alias learning_rate Step size shrinkage used in update to prevents overfitting. If the value is set to 0 it means there is no constraint. When using GPU it is usually faster than nearly all other gradient boosting algorithms that use GPU. This in turn will tend to reduce the impact of less predictive features. If it is set to a positive value it can help making the update step more conservative. gradient_based the selection probability for each training instance is proportional to the regularized absolute value of gradients 8. For instance the combination colsample_bytree 0. Introduction introduction 2. This makes predictions of 0 or 1 rather than producing probabilities. The default value is 1.
