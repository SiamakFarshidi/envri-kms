Edible is set to 0 and Poisonous is now set to 1. Now the categorical variables are shown numerically. PreparationThere are 8124 rows and 23 columns in this dataset. The two classes of mushrooms are p poisonous and e edible. I first started with regular data preparation techniques and went on to exploring the data. Let s look at how the LabelEncoder transformed our data. Now let s evaluate how well the model performs. The best model was svm and it gave 100 accuracy the next best model was logistic regression with around 94 accuracy and finally naive bayes with 81 accuracy. To prepare the dataset for classification purposes it needs to be split for the test and train. com dtmcms live webmd consumer_assets site_images articles health_tools all_about_mushrooms_slideshow 493ss_thinkstock_rf_poisonous_mushroom. I used three types of models using scikit learn which are naive bayes svm secure vector machines and logistic regression.

There are more edible mushrooms than poisonous mushrooms 4 208 versus 3 916 in this dataset. Normalized matrix Logistic RegressionScikit Learn ImplementationNow that we have trained our model. Modeling and EvaluationThe sklearn naive bayes algorithm cannot directly operate on categorical features that are non numeric so we will use sklearn s LabelEncoder to convert the categorical features to numeric values. The format of the data is in a CSV format and is in one single file called mushrooms. com uciml mushroom classification home. Making a confusion matrix The matrix below is the same but is normalized. The worst situation seems to be if it is predicted edible but it is actually poisonous. Data SetsThe dataset can be found here https www. To prepare the data for use in machine learning models I had to map these categorical values to numerical values using the labelEncoder function. Seeing what labelEncoder did to the poisonous p and edible e labels. To prepare the model the dataset needs to be split into test and train. This dataset is comprised of completely categorical features. Splitting the dataset into test and train. Poisonous mushrooms are found to mostly cause gastrointestinal problems and in the worst case may cause respiratory or kidney failure. The symptoms appear within twenty minutes to four hours of ingestion. The other situations are if it is predicted poisonous but is edible poisonous and is poisonous edible and is edible. Exploration and VisualizationShows how many unique values there are for each column. jpg AbstractFor this project I used the Mushroom Classification dataset from Kaggle. phphttp scikit learn. Mushroom Classification Is it poisonous or edible PinkDragon1000 Date 8 13 18 https img. The data is completely categorical and there are 8124 rows and 23 columns. This dataset is one of those. The goal is to find the best model to predict whether a mushroom is poisionous or edible poisonous or not poisonous. The purpose of these models are to predict that. There was nothing inaccurately predicted. Referenceshttps towardsdatascience. The method train_test_split randomly splits the dataset into 75 train and 25 test. ConclusionEven though all models did well the best model out of naive bayes SVM and logistic regression is SVM. Objectives Preprocessing and exploratory data analysis steps such as loading the data into the data frame checking the shape number of rows columns getting the head of data checking for missing and duplicate values etc. The two main classes of mushrooms are poisonous and not poisonous edible. Same matrix with normalization 7. Naive BayesScikit Learn ImplementationNow that we have trained our model. Now let s evaluate how well the logistic model performs. SVM gave about 100 accuracy while logistic gave about 94 accuracy and naive bayes performed the worst which was around 81 accuracy. Then I split the dataset into test 25 and train 75. com building a logistic regression in python step by step becd4d56c9c8https www. Given the cross validation average is close to the accuracy of the naive bayes model we can conclude that our model does not really overfit. Showing first 5 rows of the dataset. It was put on Kaggle by the UCI Machine Learning group. Visualizing number of each cap color Looking at the number of mushrooms there are for each cap shape in this dataset. Visualizing number of each cap shape 6. IntroductionI chose the Mushroom Classification dataset from Kaggle. Even though most mushrooms seem to be edible mushroom poisoning can cause discomfort and even in some cases death. Looking at the columns in dataset There are no null values in this dataset. The two matrices below show that the SVM model performed with 100 accuracy. The mushrooms are either identified as completely poisonous or completely edible. There are no duplicate values in this dataset. html Encodes labels from 0 to n_classes 1 75 train 25 test Vectorize the training and test data Creating a MultinomialNB classifier and fit the model. Support Vector Machines SVM Scikit Learn ImplementationNow let s evaluate how well the model performs. Given the cross validation average is close to the accuracy of the SVM model we can conclude that our model generalizes well and is not overfitting. Finding the best sklearn model that accurately predicts whether a mushroom is poisonous or edible using naive bayes support vector machines and logistic regression 2. Problem DefinitionPoisonous mushrooms can often times confuse people into thinking they are not posionous due to their similar appearance to some non poisonous mushroom types. The dataset was put on Kaggle by UCI Machine Learning Repository which maintains around 351 datasets. Cross validation Since the cross validation score is close to the logistic regression model score that means it is not overfitting the data. The sample set contains around 23 species of mushrooms from the gilled mushroom Agaricus and Lepiota Family. Cross validation is a way to check for overfitting.
