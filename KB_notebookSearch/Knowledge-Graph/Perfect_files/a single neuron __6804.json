Through their power and scalability neural networks have become the defining model of deep learning. The Linear Unit So let s begin with the fundamental component of a neural network the individual neuron. Welcome to Deep Learning Welcome to Kaggle s Introduction to Deep Learning course You re about to learn all you need to get started building your own deep neural networks. As a diagram a neuron or unit with one input looks like The Linear Unit y w x b The input is x. So what is deep learning Deep learning is an approach to machine learning characterized by deep stacks of computations. Using Keras and Tensorflow you ll learn how to create a fully connected neural network architecture apply neural nets to two classic ML problems regression and classification train neural nets with stochastic gradient descent and improve performance with dropout batch normalization and other techniquesThe tutorials will introduce you to these topics with fully worked examples and then in the exercises you ll explore these topics in more depth and apply them to real world datasets. Image data for instance might need three dimensions height width channels. Sequential which creates a neural network as a stack of layers. The y is the value the neuron ultimately outputs. The reason Keras uses a list here is to permit use of more complex datasets. com crawford 80 cereals. To find the output we would multiply each input to its connection weight and then add them all together. The b is a special kind of weight we call the bias. For the input x what reaches the neuron is w x. And checking against our formula we have calories 2. Single neuron models are linear models. Setting input_shape 3 ensures the model will accept three features as input sugars fiber and protein. What if we wanted to expand our model to include things like fiber or protein content That s easy enough. Example The Linear Unit as a Model Though individual neurons will usually only function as part of a larger network it s often useful to start with a single neuron model as a baseline. Neural networks are composed of neurons where each neuron individually performs only a simple computation. We ll have one input for each feature in the dataset. We can create models like those above using a dense layer which we ll learn more about in the next lesson. Does the formula y w x b look familiar It s an equation of a line It s the slope intercept equation where w is the slope and b is the y intercept. To get the output the neuron sums up all the values it receives through its connections. com kernels fork 11887334 for the Red Wine Quality dataset. This neuron s activation is y w x b or as a formula y w x b. Have questions or comments Visit the course discussion forum https www. This model is now ready to be fit to training data Why is input_shape a Python list The data we ll use in this course will be tabular data like in a Pandas dataframe. Your Turn Define a linear model https www. Multiple Inputs The 80 Cereals dataset has many more features than just sugars. Create a network with 1 linear unit. We could define a linear model accepting three input features sugars fiber and protein and producing a single output calories like so With the first argument units we define how many outputs we want. Let s get started What is Deep Learning Some of the most impressive advances in artificial intelligence in recent years have been in the field of deep learning. This depth of computation is what has enabled deep learning models to disentangle the kinds of complex and hierarchical patterns found in the most challenging real world datasets. We can just add more input connections to the neuron one for each additional feature. 5 times 5 90 102. Linear Units in Keras The easiest way to create a model in Keras is through keras. The bias enables the neuron to modify the output independently of its inputs. The formula for this neuron would be y w_0 x_0 w_1 x_1 w_2 x_2 b. In this case we are just predicting calories so we ll use units 1. Its connection to the neuron has a weight which is w. Let s think about how this might work on a dataset like 80 Cereals https www. Training a model with sugars grams of sugars per serving as input and calories calories per serving as output we might find the bias is b 90 and the weight is w 2. A neural network learns by modifying its weights. A linear unit with three inputs. The power of a neural network comes instead from the complexity of the connections these neurons can form. With the second argument input_shape we tell Keras the dimensions of the inputs. The features are arranged by column so we ll always have input_shape num_columns. Whenever a value flows through a connection you multiply the value by the connection s weight. A linear unit with two inputs will fit a plane and a unit with more inputs than that will fit a hyperplane. 5 just like we expect. We could estimate the calorie content of a cereal with 5 grams of sugar per serving like this Computing with the linear unit. The bias doesn t have any input data associated with it instead we put a 1 in the diagram so that the value that reaches the neuron is just b since 1 b b. com learn intro to deep learning discussion to chat with other learners.
