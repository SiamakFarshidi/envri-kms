Unlike standard feedforward neural networks LSTM has feedback connections. The data is multivariate time series as it contains multiple features. Rest of the models take input as a series with single feature. ndarray of the actual load reshape to one feature required for the models Min Max scaler fit and transform the dataset Train and Test splits timesteps to lookback for predictions reshape input to be samples time steps features invert predictions plt. ARIMAAuto Regressive Integrated Moving Average is a class of models that explains a given time series based on its own past values that is its own lags and the lagged forecast errors so that equation can be used to forecast future values. Models used are AutoRegressive Moving Average ARMA ARIMA LSTM AutoRegressiveAn autoregressive AR model predicts future behavior based on past behavior. tick_params left False labelleft True remove ticks plt. Loading Data and Taking a peek About the data This dataset contains 4 years of electrical consumption generation pricing and weather data for Spain. To keep this notebook accessible to beginners we use only a single feature thereby handling univariate time series. There are also many parameters that can improve the overall performance. The rest is upto your imagination This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed It is defined by the kaggle python docker image https github. We are taking moving average of 25 hours hence we can use the data we prepared for LSTM. The preprocessing works as follows Example data 1 2 3 4 5 After preprocessing x y 1 2 3 2 3 4 3 4 5 when look_back is set to 2. LSTMLong short term memory is an artificial recurrent neural network architecture used in the field of deep learning. The process is basically a linear regression of the data in the current series against one or more past values in the same series. make temporary copy of dataframe numpy. We focus on predicting electrical comsumption better than the already present forecast in the data. tick_params left False labelleft True remove ticks making data again to remove inconsistencies reshape input to be samples time steps features invert predictions plt. The first of these polynomials is for autoregression the second for the moving average. This preprocessing is only required for LSTM. Moving AverageThe moving average MA is a simple technical analysis tool that smooths out price data by creating a constantly updated average price. Points covered in this notebook Preprocessing the data Applying models and comparing their performanceThis notebook is not exhaustive in presenting the methods for forecasting. com kaggle docker python For example here s several helpful packages to load in linear algebra data processing CSV file I O e. Then we scale the feature using a MinMaxScaler. Hourly Energy Demand Time Series ForecastIn this notebook we explore the various methods of forecasting in times series. tick_params left False labelleft True remove ticks invert predictions plt. ARMAAn ARMA model or Autoregressive Moving Average model is used to describe weakly stationary stochastic time series in terms of two polynomials. The average is taken over a specific period of time like 10 days 20 minutes 30 weeks or any time period the trader chooses. PreprocessingHere we extract the single feature we will predict i. Weather data was purchased as part of a personal project from the Open Weather API for the 5 largest cities in Spain and made public here. To prepare the data for the models use create_dataset function which takes the data and creates chunks of it based on the look_back. Although to predict more accurately most of the features presented in the data should be used and the problem should be handled as multivariate. tick_params left False labelleft True remove ticks. Consumption and generation data was retrieved from ENTSOE a public portal for Transmission Service Operator TSO data. It can not only process single data points but also entire sequences of data Analysis and Future WorkThe LSTM model preformed close to the forecasted data present in the dataset. The MAPE can be improved further by forming this problem as a multivariate time series and tweaking the LSTM model. read_csv Input data files are available in the. Settlement prices were obtained from the Spanish TSO Red Electric Espa\u00f1a. The dataset is unique because it contains hourly data for electrical consumption and the respective forecasts by the TSO for consumption and pricing. Models and their MAPEHere we test various models and visualize their predictions. For example running this by clicking run or pressing Shift Enter will list all files under the input directory Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.
