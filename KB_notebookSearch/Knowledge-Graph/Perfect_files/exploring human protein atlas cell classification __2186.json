At this point it s not clear if truncate thresholding is an improvement compared to binary thresholding. Conversely as shown on the following notebook cell identification of whole cells using cv2. Let s see how connectedComponents work after both thresholding methods. Then we will overlay the green and yellow channel as the yellow channel gives a good indication of the cell shape. connectedComponents is not as efficient due to the less homogeneous signal in the yellow channel of the image. Adaptive thresholding methods apply a different threshold on different parts of the image let s see how well it does on our images. Each image is a 4 channel image with the protein of interest in the green channel. Nucleus images provide a means to identify each cell so image segmentation may start by identification of nuclei in images. com jschnab exploring the human protein atlas images by Jonathan Schnabel https www. It is the subcellular localization of this protein which is recorded in the Target column of the train. Some cells are fused to each other while they should not be. Even after playing with the upper and lower parameter values no satisfactory result is obtained. The red channel corresponds to microtubules the blue channel to the nucleus and the yellow channel to the endoplasmid reticulum. Binary and truncate methods work better. To zero simple thresholding is not adapted at all for identifying cell boundaries based on the yellow channel. 2007 if images are segmented into single cell regions additional features that are not appropriate for whole fields can be calculated after seeded watershed segmentation. connectedComponents provides a simple and effective means to label nuclei in images. According to Chen et al. Description of threshold types can be found here and here. I am totally refered to this great kernel https www. Let s try different simple thresholding methods. Let s display the different channels of the image with ID 1 since it contains several subcelullar locations for our protein of interest. See here for more explanations.
