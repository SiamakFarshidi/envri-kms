About the competitionWith more than 1 million new diagnoses reported every year prostate cancer PCa is the second most common cancer among males worldwide that results in more than 350 000 deaths annually. png The most common blue outline Gleason pattern 3 and second most common red outline Gleason pattern 4 cancer growth patterns present in the biopsy dictate the Gleason score 3 4 for this biopsy which in turn is converted into an ISUP grade 2 for this biopsy following guidelines of the International Society of Urological Pathology. The samples are made up of glandular tissue and connective tissue. These masks are provided to assist with the development of strategies for selecting the most useful subsamples of the images. The key to decreasing mortality is developing more precise diagnostics. Before diving deeper into the competition let s try to understand these first. ISUP gradeAccording to current guidelines by the International Society of Urological Pathology ISUP the Gleason scores are summarized into an ISUP grade on a scale from 1 to 5 according to the following rule Gleason score 6 ISUP grade 1 Gleason score 7 3 4 ISUP grade 2 Gleason score 7 4 3 ISUP grade 3 Gleason score 8 ISUP grade 4 Gleason score 9 10 ISUP grade 5. In this challenge we have to develop models for detecting PCa on images of prostate tissue samples. For instance if the Gleason Score is written as 3 4 7 it means most of the tumor is grade 3 and the next largest section of the tumor is grade 4 together they make up the total Gleason Score. I ll keep making changes to the kernel as I m trying to improve the model. some of these images will be used for testing. tarin_label_masks A folder containing segmentation masks showing which parts of the image led to the ISUP grade. com c prostate cancer grade assessment overview additional resources. To understand more read this https www. Reshape the images to be of shape 224 224 3 Basic image augmentation like rotation flipping etc. These tissue samples are examined by a pathologist and scored according to the Gleason grading system. Diagnosis of PCa is based on the grading of prostate tissue biopsies. If you like the kernel Don t forget to upvote. Let s take a look at one of the biopsy. A primary grade is given to describe the cells that make up the largest area of the tumor and a secondary grade is given to describe the cells of the next largest area. These images are pretty big in size for training I ll be using the resized 512x512 dataset uploaded by xhlulu. Hey guys this kernel is a very simple baseline for the competition and I train the images using Keras VGG16. For example running this by clicking run or pressing Shift Enter will list all files under the input directory Plotly for the interactive viewer see last section for dirname _ filenames in os. Let s also look at the class distribution. join dirname filename Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output. So the basic preprocessing I ve done is Normalizing the images. Not all training images have label masks and there may be false positives or false negatives in the label masks for a variety of reasons. Submission References https www. We are asked to predict ISUP grade scale 0 5 for each prostate biopsy image which is in turn derived from the gleason score three categories 3 4 5. The mask values also depend on the data provider. csv That contains the image_id name of either of the two data provider gleason and ISUP grade. Let s start preparing the images for training. com kaggle docker python For example here s several helpful packages to load in linear algebra data processing CSV file I O e. com frlemarchand high res samples into multi input cnn keras. csv containing just image_ids and data_provider. org images about murtagh7e_c114_f04 2. The classes are imbalanced more severe cases are underrepresented. If the cancer is almost entirely made up of cells with the same score the grade for that area is counted twice to calculated the total Gleason Score. The appearance of the glands forms the basis of the Gleason grading system. Gleason Score Since prostate tumors are often made up of cancerous cells that have different grades two grades are assigned for each patient. org about prostate conditions prostate cancer newly diagnosed gleason score This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed It is defined by the kaggle python docker image https github. An example as provided on the official page of the competition can make us understand better. The data is provided in 4 parts train. Let s take a look at the architecture. com kaggle media competitions PANDA Screen 20Shot 202020 04 08 20at 202. Biopsies not containing cancer are represented by an ISUP grade of 0 in this challenge.
