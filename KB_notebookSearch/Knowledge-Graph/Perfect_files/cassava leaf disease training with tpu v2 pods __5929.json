Changing the learning rate batch wise seems more efficent than epoch wise specially for the warm up phase. org guide data_performance Custom training with tf. Visualize predictionsFinally it is a good practice to always inspect some of the model s prediction by looking at the data this can give an idea if the model is getting some predictions wrong because the data is really hard of if it is because the model is actually bad. The TPU software stack uses this mesh network to enable many racks of machines to be programmed as a single giant ML supercomputer via a variety of flexible high level APIs.

What s in a Cloud TPU Pod A single Cloud TPU Pod can include more than 1 000 individual TPU chips which are connected by an ultra fast two dimensional toroidal mesh network as illustrated below. Model Training Model loss graph Model evaluationNow we can evaluate the performance of the model first we can evaluate the usual metrics like accuracy precision recall and f1 score scikit learn provides the perfect function for this classification_report. com dimitreoliveira cassava leaf disease ext 50 tfrec classes 512x512 Dataset source discussion thread https www. com cdeotte rotation augmentation gpu tpu 0 96 input image is one image of size dim dim 3 not a batch of b dim dim 3 output image randomly rotated fix for size 331 CONVERT DEGREES TO RADIANS ROTATION MATRIX LIST DESTINATION PIXEL INDICES ROTATE DESTINATION PIXELS ONTO ORIGIN PIXELS FIND ORIGIN PIXEL VALUES input image is one image of size dim dim 3 not a batch of b dim dim 3 output image randomly sheared fix for size 331 SHEAR MATRIX LIST DESTINATION PIXEL INDICES ROTATE DESTINATION PIXELS ONTO ORIGIN PIXELS FIND ORIGIN PIXEL VALUES CutOut 10 15 cut outs 5 10 cut outs 2 5 cut outs 1 cut out Datasets utility functions One Hot Encoding needed to use categorical_crossentropy loss Unfreeze layers while leaving BatchNorm layers frozen Unfreeze layers while leaving BatchNorm layers frozen Visualization utility functions binary string in this case these are image ID strings If no labels only image IDs return None for labels this is the case for test data data auto squaring this will drop data that does not fit into square or square ish rectangle size and spacing display magic formula tested to work from 1x1 to 10x10 images Visualize model predictions Model evaluation rng i for i in range total_epochs Create train and validation sets Build TF datasets Step functions update metrics update metrics Model unfreeze all layers except batch normalization Setup training loop Run training step Validation run at the end of each epoch Validation run Compute metrics Report metrics Early stopping monitor Set up next epoch Load best model weights OOF predictions.

Model parameters Load data Augmentation Auxiliary functions Training data samples with augmentation Datasets distribution Competition data 2019 competition data Dataset oversampled Learning rate scheduleWe are going to use a cosine learning rate schedule with a warm up phase this may be a good idea since we are using a pre trained model the warm up phase will be useful to avoid the pre trained weights degradation resulting in catastrophic forgetting during the schedule the learning rate will slowly decrease to very low values this helps the model to land on more stable weights. get_gcs_path cassava leaf disease classification Original dataset Center croped and resized 50 TFRecord Center croped and resized 50 TFRecord External Center croped and resized 50 TFRecord by classes Center croped and resized 50 TFRecord External by classes FILENAMES_COMP tf. Was not able to make progressive unfreezing work. We are evaluating the model on the OOF predictions it stands for Out Of Fold since we are training using K Fold our model will see all the data and the correct way to evaluate each fold is by looking at the predictions that are not from that fold. org tutorials distribute custom_training Cloud TPU https cloud.
