On the left side of the map are layers that correspond to COVID 19 prevalence. Group CThis option only has one choice that colours the regions to display the population density measured in people per square kilometer. The code for this whole process is open source on our GitHub task_notebooks.

A color spectrum is then used to mark regions depending on the value of the numerical climate metric measure. The goal of the first line of work is to provide our teammates with additional insights about their findings like the location of clinical trials or reports and claims. Introduction introduction 2.

Currently we have comprehensive climate data available for visualization only in the country of Italy none of the other countries can be analyzed with this tool yet. We have achieved some initial results but additional work is required in order to extract the important insights that would be useful to the research community at large. We provide very granular datasets on various aspects related to the spread of the virus and the resulting mortality in the population. Is displayed with male on the left and female on the right equal would make both white though the deviation is only small on average most countries have slightly more women than men except places like China whose long term policies have affected the distribution. In the near future an automated extraction pipeline will be set up and will generate up to date datasets in a public repository. The extraction of geolocations on the original CORD 19 dataset.

If a region had a uniform distribution of ages they would all be white dots so this example from Emilia Romagna shows a lower proportion of under 29 s and an over representation of 40 59 year olds. Italy meteorology meteorology 8. Date ranges will be incorporated into future functionality. At the current time the extraction of geolocations from the CORD 19 datast is at a preliminary stage. Selecting a single date will populate the map with the number of COVID cases up until that date. Our goal is not to draw any conclusion from the data but only to present it in a way that is as accessible as possible. Defining Workflow workflow 10. For example if the date April 12 is selected then the COVID statistics will display the accumulated cases up until April 12 and not the number of new cases recoveries deaths on April 12 only.
