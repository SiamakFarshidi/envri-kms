Comparison of Clustering AlgorithmsK means Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering are similarly. Gaussian Naive Bayes4. If a candidate s Chance of Admit is less than or equal to 80 the candidate will receive the 0 label. So basically this set is about the Graduate Admissions data i. 35 which rounds to 306 with an average standard deviation of 7. Decision Tree Classification5.

Preparing Data for Clustering PCA All features x were collected in one feature with Principal Component Analysis. K means Clustering The elbow method is used to determine the best number of clusters for k means clustering. THE LOR is ordered same as the SOPAre students in this sample too good First looking at the students LOR SOP and University Ratings most students score 4 5 on the scales not many scored 1 2. CGPACumulative Grade Points Average CGPA is a measure of a student s marks thus his performance in his undergraduate degree. 821208259148699 The results for Linear Regression now 3 features r_square score 0. 8212241793299223 The two results are very close. Gaussian Naive BayesTest for Train Dataset 4. Random Forest Step 3 Train Algorithm Step4 Test Algorithm Linear Regression Selected Features 2. Random Forest Classification6. These aren t public figures I mean yes it might not be public but dont you think universities might be grading these applications on some scale of rating so that the scores can be standardized. Nonetheless comparing means for their GRE and TOEFL scores which are of a universal criteria they clearly perform better than the average student as the ETS states. K Nearest Neighbors KNN Classification Preparing Data for ClassificationIf a candidate s Chance of Admit is greater than 80 the candidate will receive the 1 label. Logistic Regression Test for Train Dataset 2. Research University RatingThe rating of the university the student completed his undergraduate degree from. LORLetter of Recommendation LOR is a letter written by a person that knows the student and recommends that the university accept his admission this person can be a professor in his undergraduate degree or a professional whom the student have worked with. Chance of AdmissionLet s first take a review on the chances of admission. 6 with a standard deviation of 19. K Nearest Neighbors ClassificationTest for Train Dataset Comparison of Classification AlgorithmsAll classification algorithms achieved around 90 success. CLUSTERING ALGORITHMS UNSUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS Preparing Data for Classification 1. Exploring this variable it s ordered from 1 to 5 with 0. pdfThe sample s GRE score mean is 316 which is a little bit higher than the mean mentioned previously 306 As the distribution plot shows the GRE test scores are somehow normally distributed. With this kernel students will guess their capacities and they will decide whether to apply for a master s degree or not. And since one of our goals is to predict the chance of admission let s take a look on how the different variables correlate with it. For example running this by clicking run or pressing Shift Enter will list the files in the input directory Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output. TOEFL ScoreTest of English as a Foreign Language TOEFL is a very popular test for English language amongst universities worldwide it is marked based on three sections Reading Listening Speaking and Writing each one of them is out of 30 yielding a maximum score of 120 and a minimum of 0. ETS the institute that offers the test recorded a mean score of 82. Many universities find this letter significant because it better describe the student from a personal perspective. Support Vector Machine3. Random Forest ClassificationTest for Train Dataset 6. Decision Tree Comment Because most candidates in the data have over 70 chance many unsuccessful candidates are not well predicted Prediction Models Classification Algorithm Supervised Machine Learning 1. The most successful one is Gaussian Naive Bayes with 96 score. Hierarchical Clustering The dendrogram method is used to determine the best number of clusters for hierarchical clustering. Decision Tree Classification Test for Train Dataset 5. The number is 3 again. 92 Research Experience 0 or 1 Chance of Admit 0. Although this is the mean for a wide range of students from all around the world that took the test for different purposes as students applying for an engineering graduate degree might have a higher average than high school students. png PurposeTo apply for a master s degree is a very expensive and intensive work. Input data files are available in the. org s gre pdf gre_interpreting_scores. Graduate Admission Analysis and Prediction https learnrhome. If these 3 features CGPA GRE SCORE and TOEFL SCORE are used instead of all 7 features together the result is not bad and performance is increased because less calculation is required. png http debarghyadas. Hence the SOP LOR scores. 97 Step1 Data Collection Data Extraction Import Libraries Step 2 Data Analysis or Data Exploration GRE ScoresThe Graduate Record Examinations GRE is a the most popular test for graduate schools admission it consists of three sections Analytical Writing Verbal and Quantitative. The test s maximum score is 340 and minimum is 260 and according to an official GRE score document the mean test score for all individuals from July 1 2014 to June 30 2017 almost 1 700 000 test taker is 306. How good the university is a value between 1 and 5 in integer increment and since it has positive correlation factors with other variables it s clear that 5 is the highest rating and 1 is the lowest. SOPStatement of Purpose SOP is a letter written by the student himself to state his purpose and motivation for completing a graduate degree in addition to his goals while and after he completes his study. It is evident that the most contribution factors to the chance of admission are CGPA GRE Score and TOEFL Score Prediction Models Regression Algorithm Supervised Machine Learning 1. All those folks who are preparing for MS might point out this question from where did you get SOP LOR scores. To conclude it seems only wise to consider the sample to be somehow above average. Given a set of standardized scores like GRE TOEFL SOP standard scores LOR standard scores what is probability basically i have done a YES NO scenario of gaining admission into a particular school. separating train 80 and test 20 sets normalization list to array confusion matrix print y_test_01 1 str len y_test_01 y_test_01 1 29 cm visualization confusion matrix print y_test_01 1 str len y_test_01 y_test_01 1 29 cm visualization confusion matrix print y_test_01 1 str len y_test_01 y_test_01 1 29 cm visualization confusion matrix print y_test_01 1 str len y_test_01 y_test_01 1 29 cm visualization confusion matrix print y_test_01 1 str len y_test_01 y_test_01 1 29 cm visualization finding k value n_neighbors k confusion matrix print y_test_01 1 str len y_test_01 y_test_01 1 29 cm visualization for data visualization whitten normalize separating train 80 and test 20 sets normalization.
