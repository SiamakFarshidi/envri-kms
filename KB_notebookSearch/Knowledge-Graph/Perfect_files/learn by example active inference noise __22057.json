This is less plausible for biological reality random fluctuations originate from dynamical systems themselves e. Random walk with Gaussian steps The sum of the random numbers develops as a random walk https en. The noise with temporal smoothness is generated in main 3 steps 1. This means higher order derivatives of the noise do contain information as also the noise is differentiable with finite variance in contrast to white noise that has infinite variance so there is no information in higher order derivatives. Irrelevant or meaningless data or output occurring along with desired information. The matlab sqrtm function calculates the Matrix square root where X sqrtm A returns the principal square root of the matrix A that is X X A. com introduction to expected value variance and covariance or https www. org wiki Convolution or watch this video https www. Below my notes sigma 0. Could we avoid the last normalization step by taking a normalized Gaussian Filter Could we take an alternative approach in the last normalization step and apply a traditional normalization of the dataset this will move stretch the convoluted noise line vertically to the values of the original covariance matrix and will keep a temporal smoothness Something that could be further investigated. Convolution to create smoothness in the noises i. So the noise will be smoothened with filter h t e frac t 2 2 sigma 2 where sigma defines the amount of roughness smoothness introduced in the noise as sigma gets bigger the filter gets broader and increasingly more datapoints around the current sample will add weight to smoothen the signal. Noise with temporal smoothnessWelcome to my notebook on Kaggle. org wiki Free_energy_principle by examples in this case the generation of noise with temporal smoothness which is some form of colored noise in signal processing or what I would call Natural noise. Why noise Noise https www. uk spm K toeplitz exp t. Note that we are still looking at intermediate results because next step is the normalization of the data which will also impact the position of the line. Hence the recommendation in the FEP is for sigma to be 1 but don t make it too small else you dont have enough temporal smoothness. Understanding the resultsAs expected With sigma to 0 the convoluted noise will be the same as the white noise and therefor matching the covariances matrix. com story karl friston free energy principle artificial intelligence Understanding Active Inference and the FEP is not easy and has many intricate details if you needed to google the word intricate it proves the point. You have fluctuations in the omni vision camera system to detect the ball the wheels to drive for intercept the ball itself is not rolling straight and so on and so forth. com watch v N zd T17uiE. Interesting to see is that the normalization also pulls the graph closer to zero even with a wide filter. Random fluctuations are sufficiently fast that we do not observe their serial or temporal correlations. 063202 top 0 h 2 delta 1. Having a robotic system working reliable under uncertainty is a significant challenge. The white gaussian noise will be convoluted with a filter h t e frac t 2 2 sigma 2 to generate convoluted noise. In nature noise and other inaccuracies are all around us and biological life as well engineering algorithms e. Why noise with temporal smoothness In conventional control theory it is assumed that fluctuations are independent a sequence of serially uncorrelated random variables with zero mean infinitely rough. In other words g t shifts over f t and for each point it calculates the result by weighing the neighboring points on f x by g x. This temporal smoothness is created by convoluting the random noise by a filter h t. 826007 sigma 15 8 why is the convoluted noise not close to 0 Maybe if I take a wide filter high gamma the line will come close to zero because the average is almost zero But it is not. org wiki White_noise White noise White noise is a random signal having equal intensity at different frequencies giving it a constant power spectral density. ConvolutionThe Free energy principle assumes that noise has some form of temporal smoothness because random fluctuations originate from dynamical systems themselves. l N K note P the precision Matrix N length of data sequence For me these code lines were not easy to understand so have been digging in to understand how the noise is generated. Trying to describe it in words For each point t on the f t curve the new value is calculated by overlaying f t with g x centered around t and calculate for each point g x times f x. 688045 top 0 h 5 delta 0. Easy example is throwing 2 six sided dice 100 times which will give you a random sequence but not with a uniform distribution e. Note that the first and last samples of the convoluted noise are not correct there are no samples before t 0 and after t T for the correct weighing. sqrt variance N Show the first 80 values for visual inspection Plot Gaussian white noise sequence to get the rough ragged noise due to the Identically distributed and statistically independent Print the distribution plot to showcase the bell curve The more values the better the curve becomes visible to plot the data Show with the same random seed we get the same random sequence Let s compare both methods with a low and high correlation covariance matrix input covariance matrix input high correlation note this matrix must be symmetric since it is a covariance matrix note on the diagonal you will find the variances Generate white Gaussian noise sequences dimension of noise Sqrtm method Cholesky method same random seed to generate the same sequences Plot the white noise sequence Calculate the variance covariance of the generated data sets in FEP sigma is usually 0.

While the term white refers to the way the signal power is distributed i. begin pmatrix 1 rho 0 sqrt 1 rho 2 end pmatrix begin pmatrix 1 rho rho 1 end pmatrix So if we have 2 two uncorrelated Gaussian random variables binom x_ 1 x_ 2 of mean 0 and variance 1 then begin pmatrix 1 0 rho sqrt 1 rho 2 end pmatrix. The covariances will inevitably change because we introduced temporal correlation. source WIKI https upload. normal function to draw random samples from a normal Gaussian distribution Repeatable random sequencesIn experiments we need random data but we must also have the possibility to have the same random data to compare results. org wiki Kalman_filter need to function despite these fluctuations. See example below by chance the first 5 numbers are positive and all contribute most to the convoluted result. 7 of the samples between 3 and 3 Multiple with the standard deviation to get the right variance or simply use the python numpy. Typically noise is expressed like in a Linear dynamical system https en. 3 of the samples are between 1 and 1 95. It is noise with some form of temporal smoothness. Below illustration gives you the intuition of convolution. Normalize to the original variancesVisible inspection of the convoluted noise shows immediately that the variance of the convoluted noise is not the same anymore as variance of the random noise as defined in the covariance matrix Sigma _ w. m from the Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging the generation of sequences makes use of the function spm_sqrtm which extends matlab sqrtm functionality by using a computationally expedient approximation. 2 2 s 2 K K diag 1. com jasonrosewell on Unsplash https unsplash. sqrt diag K K z i spm_sqrtm inv P randn M i.

Please play around for yourself to get the intuition what is happening. One of these intricate details is the creation of noise with temporal smoothness noise samples at consecutive times that are correlated. The covariance matrix is a generalization of the covariance of two variables and captures the way in which all variables in the dataset may change together. Let s print the estimated covariance matrix and mean of the convoluted noise. It is nicely explained in video https www. Import the dependencies Setting up the time data randn generates an array of shape in this case N filled with random floats sampled from a univariate normal Gaussian distribution of mean 0 and variance 1 so 68.

Drawing random numbers from a zero mean gaussian does not mean you get nicely alternating positive and negative values. So what is convolution For a quick refresher see Convolution on wiki https en. 23594336400718183 N 101 so the sum is 23. Which makes sense a random generator that is forced to the sum of all random drawn numbers is always zero actually can only pick 0 every time and that is not random anymore. The noise samples are identically distributed but not independent. With sigma to infty the convoluted noise will be a straight line equal to the sum of all random values. In other words if we take a wide filter high sigma the y position of the horizontal line is a probability distribution with mean of zero and variance increasing with N increasing and not always close to 0 3. This notebook is to understand step by step the generation of this type of noise as done in the FEP. Understanding the resultsThe results were somehow different as I expected so needed to reconcile for myself to understand what is happening. An agent can estimate these higher order motions internally position speed acceleration jerk etc using generalized motions for example in the linear dynamical system example under local linearity assumptions dot x f x u w dot x f x u cdot x w dot x f x u cdot x w dot x f x u cdot x w etcThe promise is because of being able to estimate these higher motions internally by the agent that active inference could outperform eg kalman filtering. uk spm generate the noise with temporal smoothness K toeplitz exp t. 158 corresponding to gamma 80 is often used. And the sum of all the random numbers is not exactly zero. 454737 top 0 h 4 delta 2. By zero mean normalizing the random numbers and thus ensuring the sum is 0 the line is as exactly on zero as expected see test graph above. org wikipedia commons 6 6a Convolution_of_box_signal_with_itself2. Thus the two words Gaussian and white are often both specified in mathematical models of systems. begin pmatrix x_ 1 x_ 2 end pmatrix begin pmatrix x_ 1 rho x_ 1 sqrt 1 rho 2 x_ 2 end pmatrix generates two correlated normal variables binom w_ 1 w_ 2 with given correlation coefficient rho In the active_inference library spm_DEM_z. Gaussian white noise. We can however achieve normalization back to the original variances. Python has standard functions to generate these random numbers e. 8 in the graph mean sum N. We can make use of the fact that the Python s random module is not truly random it is pseudo random with a deterministic algorithm. l N K note P the precision Matrix N length of data sequence And the below Python code from Sherin Grimbergen TU Delft for noise with temporal smoothness generation DiscussionOut of scope for the notebook but by understanding the FEP code some simplifications come to mind. Generate Gaussian white Noise1. Auto correlationBecause we introduced temporal correlations in the noise we should be able to see this in the autocorrelation of the normalized convoluted noise. Armed with this knowledge you should be in a position to better understand the following lines of Matlab code in the active_inference library spm_DEM_z. Also the mean starts to shift away from 0. com watch v ZjaBn93YPWo for an introduction if needed. Noise is modelled in the Free Energy Principle similar as in optimal control theory https en. Therefore these signals are continuous and not infinitely rough as is white noise for example. For now let us understand how FEP generates natural noise. multi dimensional noise exampleLet s generate an n dimensional zero mean white gaussian noise N 0 Sigma _ w with a certain covariance matrix Sigma _ w. In the FEP it is achied by normalizing P with F where F diagonal left frac 1 sqrt diag P TP right Below example shows what it calculates so you can build the intuition for it. 612204 top 0 h 3 delta 1. We are going to normalize the sequence by multiplying P by an by normalisation matrix F bar w wPF such that the variances of w will be equal to bar w. Research into true biological inspired artificial intelligence continues and neuroscience has produced a candidate which suggests that several global brain theories might be unified within a free energy framework Free Energy Principle FEP by Karl Friston The genius neuroscientist who might hold the key to true AI https www. The diagonal of the covariance matrix are the variances of each of the random variables. com watch v 9B5vEVjH2Pk The Cholesky decomposition is commonly used in simulating systems like Monte Carlo to generate random sequences with multiple correlated variables https en. 8 resulting in a straight line on 23.

It produces the numbers from an initial seed value. Let s see some examples. independently over time or among frequencies. m from the Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging SPM https www. Since we want for bar w the same variance as w TODO Note that F T F since F only has the diagonal filled And let s see the effect of the various roughness parameters on the normalized convolution in the graph below. In example above the mean is 0. as sigma gets smaller the filter gets smaller and increasingly less datapoints around the current sample will add weight to smoothen the signal so the signals keeps its original roughness. I did record my notes so it might help others in their journey to understand Active Inference minimizing the underlying Free Energy https en. But the variance of a random walk does not converge with Number of steps to infty the probabilities proportional to the possible numbers approaches a normal distribution. So like the Cholesky decomposition the Matrix square root function is used to generate sequences with multiple correlated variables. The other way around is also true with sigma to infty the convoluted noise will be less matching the covariance matrix of random white noise a straight line is not particular random. org wiki Random_walk with Gaussian steps. 5 36 number 6 and 1 36 number 12 1 dimensional exampleLet s generate a 1 dimensional white gaussian noise N 0 \u03c3 2 a zero mean Gaussian with a certain variance.

Kalman filtering https en. com photos 3VzJwKx6hGc Artificial Intelligence is not yet really intelligent it is a linear regression technique and with a lot of data and a lot of compute power you can still deliver amazing results. As expected white noise gives a low autocorrelation while the normalized convoluted noise shows higher correlations. 158 why is the convoluted noise above the white noise spikes I was somehow expecting to see the line to be closer around zero not having spikes even above the white noise random numbers are drawn from a zero mean Gaussian some some do they not balance out Looking at the printouts of sample examples it became apparent why. For example compare the efficiency of different algorithms under same circumstances. The smaller the sigma the closer the match to the covariance matrix of the white noise but also less temporal smoothness. use the python numpy. Looking at the printouts it became apparent why. In essence every i th element of the diagonal of P is divided by the root of the i th element of P TP which is in essence the integral of the filter in each column such that the i th element of the diagonal F TP TPF equals 1. It is a probability distribution with mean of zero and variance in the order of N. org wiki Linear_dynamical_system where the state space is described as basic form dot x f x u w y g x z The noise appears in the equations z is noise in the measurement random fluctuations of sensory states w noise in the actual environment random fluctuations of the motion of hidden states x is the hidden state being estimated y is the observation u is the control signal f and g are functions to describe the dynamic system.
