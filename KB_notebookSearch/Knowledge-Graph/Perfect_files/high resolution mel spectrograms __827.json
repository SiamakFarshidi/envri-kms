Here we combine FFTs of varying window length to tackle this. Code that runs FFTs of several window sizes aligns their centers and then applies mel weighting to combine them. Uses tensorflows eager mode which I couldn t get to work in a kaggle kernel Tensorboard https i. png high_res_melspectros https i. This representation should be more invariant to distortions of both frequency and time due to the mel frequency averaging and time window averaging respectively. png or just use 0 or SR 2 batch_framed_signal has shape batch_size x n_windows x fft_l1 decrease weights for samples w more than wvls_per_window_hinge wvls_per_window_hinge method could be improved maybe weight pmf of poisson. With single FFTs short windows have good time resolution but lack frequency breadth no lower frequencies whereas long windows have good frequency breadth but lack time precision windows contain many wavelengths at higher frequencies.
