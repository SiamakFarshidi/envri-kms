Only a few people with age 62 suffer from HepatitisCreating a KDE Plot using seaborn libraryKDE plot Kernel Density Estimation Plot visualizes the distribution of obserations in a datasetSimilar to the displot the kde plot shows a bit more clearer distribution of age and we can clearly see that the average age of people suffering from Hepatitis lies in the range 35 40Various Plots for Checking the Bilirubin distribution for various integer valuesAll these plots indicate that people with lower bilirubin values between 0 2 are more prone to HepatitisThis implies that Maximum people have alkaline phosphate value of 80 100 Comparing the Gender Distribution in the given DatasetBar Chart for the Gender Distribution using matplotlibPiechart for the gender DistributionHistogram plot for the gender distribution using plotly. with maximum people having age 36 38 and 50 55. Negative Correlation means a variable increases decreases as the other variable decreases increases respectivelyDropping the protime column in the dataframe as it contains a lot of null values and is of no use in the EDACreating a dataframe which only contains numeric data of the main datasetDropping the columns antivirals and histology as they are not numeric data Creating a Correlation Plot to understand the correlation among various features in a better way visuallyUsing Seaborn LibraryThe correlation plot here shows us that features bilirubin and alk_phosphate both have higher positive correlation with histology and features bilirubin and alk_phosphate both hae higher negative correlation with albumin Using plotly. read_csv Input data files are available in the read only. express libraryCreating a displot using seaborn librarydistplot now deprecated to displot combines the matplotlib hist function with the seaborn kdeplot and rugplot functionsThis shows that most of the people in the dataset have age between 25 50 approx. A positive correlation means a variable increases decreases as other other variable increases decreases respectively. input directory For example running this by clicking run or pressing Shift Enter will list all files under the input directory You can write up to 20GB to the current directory kaggle working that gets preserved as output when you create a version using Save Run All You can also write temporary files to kaggle temp but they won t be saved outside of the current session.
