Reasons of Dilated Convolution 1. That s why we ll focus on using DeepLab. The pre training effects of these three models in the Pascal VOC dataset are shown below where Pascal VOC contains 20 categories of images http www. When l 1 it is standard convolution2. For this reason dilated convolutions are used to increase the receptive field of the higher layers compensating for the reduction in receptive field induced by removing subsampling. com max 794 1 67TMJkhBO3sTtzAg2oUHg. Extra batch normalization and ReLU activation are added after each 3 x 3 depthwise convolution3. Depth of the model is increased without changing the entry flow network structure https i0. Why using DEEPLABV3 RESNET101 For the semantic segmentation model GluonCV Torch mainly supports pre trained FCN PSPNet and DeepLab V3. such reduction in receptive field is an unacceptable price to pay for higher resolution. com av blog media wp content uploads 2019 01 semantic_8. construct an optimizer and a learning rate scheduler. com review dilated convolution semantic segmentation 9d5a5bd768f52. However this also reduces the receptive field which severely reduces the amount of context. A naive approach is to simply remove subsampling striding steps in the network in order to increase the resolution of feature map. com abhishek mask rcnn with augmentation and multiple masks SIIM DeepLabV3 https www. png The left one is the standard convolution. DeepLab V3 uses Aligned Xception as its main feature extractor with the following modifications 1. In FCN it also shows that when 32 upsampling is needed we can only get a very rough segmentation results. com blog 2019 02 tutorial semantic segmentation google deeplab i have used some of the contents from that link definitely a great resource for understanding deeplabv3 wellPlease UPVOTE if you find this kernel Helpful IMPORTS Utility Loss Function Function for training Mask Decoder Steel Dataset paths Steel DataLoader Understanding the DeepLab Model ArchitectureDeepLab V3 uses ImageNet s pretrained Resnet 101 with atrous convolutions as its main feature extractor. float mean to average on multi gpu. com images 427 d258324e597cccec479b706fa7a2a04b. png resize 649 2C333 ssl 1 DeepLabV3 model with a ResNet 101 backbone https pytorch. All max pooling operations are replaced by depthwise separable convolution with striding2. com review drn dilated residual networks image classification semantic segmentation d527e1a8fb5I highly recommend you to check this link Semantic Segmentation Introduction to the Deep Learning Technique Behind Google Pixel s Camera https www. Quite a few algorithms have been designed to solve this task such as the Watershed algorithm Image thresholding K means clustering Graph partitioning methods etc. Many deep learning architectures like fully connected networks for image segmentation have also been proposed but Google s DeepLab model has given the best results till date. png l 1 left l 2 Middle l 4 Right The above figure shows more examples about the receptive field. When l 1 it is dilated convolution. com proxy 1 mlHFvK6H_wMCyURSZNZWGQ. gif Standard Convolution l 1 Left Dilated Convolution l 2 Right The above illustrate an example of dilated convolution when l 2. DeepLab V3 is a very common open source model which has very good effect on semantic segmentation tasks. com soulmachine siim deeplabv3 PyTorch Starter U Net ResNet https www. com tensorflow tensorflow blob r1. And it is found that using dilated convolution can also help for image classification task in this paper. com article 5710352893 Google s Deeplabv3 uses dilated convolution lets first talk little bit about dilated convolutions Dilated Convolution equation of DilatedNet https miro. We can see that at the summation it is s lt p that we will skip some points during convolution. In the paper mentioned below it uses d as dilation factor. The right one is the dilated convolution. It uses Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling and bilinear upsampling for the decoder module on top of the modified ResNet block. It is found that with small output feature map obtained at the end of the network the accuracy is reduced in semantic segmentation. com ateplyuk pytorch starter u net resnet https github. We can see that the receptive field is larger compared with the standard one. png The following shows the effects of three semantic segmentation models in the ADE20K dataset where ADE20K is a scene resolution dataset published by MIT that contains a variety of scenarios including people backgrounds and objects.
