Since we did not specify it we will be using standard ones check doc There is a option to define own ones or to just select some of the standards. Let us split the variables one more time. So even tough it would be better we want to focus on algortihm and automatic feature engineering NOTE Even tough it is automatic we can incorporate some manual features. Entities and EntitySets2. Label encoding Making it machine readable NaN imputation will be skipped in this tutorial. Featuretools is an open source Python library for automatically creating features out of a set of related tables using a technique called deep feature synthesis. It is by no means complete and there are lot of them underneath function is built that shows us percentage. NOTE This NaN handling is just for the sake of it. Featuretools makes it easy Our goal in the end is simple. IF we know some domain specific information. What if we can make it a one liner. Relationships between tables3. Relationships betweeen the sets Feature primitives Basically which functions are we going to use to create features. A set of datasets where all of them are in a relationship with one another and from all of them some information should be extracted. Well now it seems we can. If we merge datasets now we can perofrm neccesary operations and seperate them later. Automated feature engineering like many topics in machine learning is a complex subject built upon a foundation of simpler ideas. In order to avoid it we can introduce some limited sample size. Even more appropriately we will be working on Home Credit Default Risk. There are a few concepts that we will cover along the way 1. Deep feature synthesis 2. Load in the data NOTE datasets are huge working on them will be computationally costly. Thank you https docs. com http Feature engineering is tiresome and takes the biggest amount of time do it. By going through these ideas one at a time we can build up our understanding of how featuretools which will later allow for us to get the most out of it. Feature primitives aggregations and transformations4. Want to find out how to do the feature enigeering step automatically in a concise and compact tutorial applying it on a binary classification problem using lightGBM look no further After finding out that data scientists created a tool that replaces data scientists I had to try it out. Predict whether the customer will default or not.
