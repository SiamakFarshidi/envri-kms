However if you use a forest with a parameterization that has been cross validated to be optimal you should be fine. com jimthompson boruta feature importance analysis drop str columns drop columns with greater than 500 null values. To illustrate this the boruta paper includes the following visualization showing variable pruning on a synthetic dataset image. Run a random forest classifier on the extended information system and gather the Z scores computed. In this synthetic case boruta prunes down from 500 to 20 variables. Simultaneously as more and more uninformative variables are removed the feature importance of the remaining informative variables will improve. This effect is why boruta needs to run dozens of iterations to be effective. This importance will bouy the average importance assigned to that variable and prevent it from failing the test and being removed. com residentmario decision trees with animal shelter outcomes. For each attribute with undetermined importance perform a two sided test of equality with the MZSA. In a random forest you train hundreds of purposefully overfitted decision trees with each decision tree only gaining access to a random subset of the columns in the dataset. Noisier more random related variables will see larger gains as they will be decorrelated from the noise being pruned from the dataset. What basically happens is that randomly shuffled shadow attributes are defined to establish a baseline performance for prediction against the target variable. What does all relevant mean The paper defines a variable as being relevant if there is a subset of attributes in the dataset among which the variable is not redundant when used for prediction. By training a random forest boruta will by sheer chance generate decision trees having the B feature but lacking the A feature. png In this example there is one noise green variable which is lifted very far up from the random noise in terms of Z score as the algorithm iterates along. Boruta is an R algorithm since ported to Python which implements another approach to feature selection. This is the reason that decision trees in sklearn are able to return a feature_importance_ attribute and the reason that said attribute is so useful for choosing your input variables. Random forests are themselves based on decision trees so I need to briefly discuss those first more details on this algorithm in this notebook https www. Conclusion boruta is a very interesting and very powerful feature selection algorithm which general applicability across almost all datasets. It s got one huge disadvantage however even when used with lower complexity trees it still has an execution time measured in hours not the seconds provided by all of the sklearn tools. Then a hypothesis test is used to determine with a certain level of risk 0. Recall that we had a feature B that was redundant to feature A but still related to the objective variable. com tilii7 boruta feature elimination https www. Shuffle the added attributes to remove their correlations with the response. Automated feature selection with boruta IntroductionIn a previous notebook Automated feature selection with sklearn https www. Remove all shadow attributes. png attachment image. To illustrate this suppose that we have two variables A and B. Deem the attributes which have importance significantly lower than MZSA as unimportant and permanently remove them from the information system. If a random forest is able to decrease variance more than it increases bias relative to a single well pruned decision tree then it will perform better as a classifier on the dataset albeit one that takes at least an order of magnitude longer to train. In particular I would suggest using it for particularly hairy datasets one with hundreds of potentially weakly correlated predictor variables. Each new data point flows down the tree either down the left branch or the right branch and ultimately arrives at its classification result. Gini impurity has the important property that it like decision trees is non parametric and hence for a large enough sample size we can expect it to work with data in any numerical format. Repeat the procedure until the importance is assigned for all the attributes or the algorithm has reached the previously set limit of the random forest runs. If we were minimizing our variable count then we would remove B. DemonstrationHere s a sample demonstration on the same kepler dataset used for the sklearn tests in the previous notebook. This fact also makes it very very hard to tune as every parameter tuning will require extremely high additional CPU time. Find the maximum Z score among shadow attributes MZSA and then assign a hit to every attribute that scored better than MZSA. Deem the attributes which have importance significantly higher than MZSA as important. Gini impurity is an only slightly complicated measurement related to the Gini coefficient and the subject of a future notebook that essentially measures how well the classifier is performing on a given subset of data. This is different from the minimal optimal problem which is the problem of finding the minimal subset of features which are performant in a model. For some other boruta demos see https www. In introducing it I ll pull from the paper that was published alongside the algorithm Google Boruta to find it. In a regular decision tree the A feature will be given high importance whle the B feature will be mostly ignored in A s favor. The algorithmBoruta works by taking this randomness even further. To classify an incoming point you have each of these trees cast a vote as to where to put it and the majority vote wins. In practice decision trees can subject points to dozens of tests as they flow down the tree before assigning their ultimate classification and if you allow arbitrarily many splits you can generate a perfectly overfitted decision tree To control for this we may specify that we will only continue to split nodes so long as the decision results in a certain minimum benefit. Here s the algorithm 1. boruta attempts to curate features down to the all relevant stopping point not the minimal optimal stopping point. A simple decision tree might classify every point that has X 0. So you should only use it when this execution wait time is worth it. By increasing the randomness of the decision trees being built we naturally increase their bias but by then averaging their decisions we naturally reduce the variance. In simpler cases and in cases like the one in this notebook it doesn t seem worth it. In other words with this Kepler dataset the solution to the all relevant problem is all of the fields and we shouldn t be rejecting anything That s a really stark contrast to the results we got out of the sklearn functions and really illustrates the difference between maximal minimal and all relevant quite well. 05 by default if each variable is correlated only randomly. These variables are correlated with one another and correlated with the objective variable. The key insight in random forests and the reason that they perform better than decision trees alone is mass voting. com residentmario automated feature selection with sklearn I introduced the motivation and a sequence of sklearn solutions for the problem of feature selection. It s both significantly more complex than the algorithms offered in sklearn and also carries itself a bit differently in terms of what its goal is. While machine learning models in production should ultimately target building on minimal optimal selections of the data the thesis of Boruta is that for the purposes of exploration minimum optimality goes too far. Obviously the larger the feature space and the more variables B is redundant to the larger the number of trees that must be in the forest for a tree where B is not redudant to occur. A random forest meanwhile is an ensemble of weak decision trees. However A is a stronger signal than B is. In these cases in the absence of feature A feature B will be given high importance instead. Variables that fail to be rejected are removed from consideration. Extend the information system by adding copies of all variables the information system is always extended by at least 5 shadow attributes even if the number of attributes in the original set is lower than 5. According to boruta every variable in this dataset is relevant to the target variable in at least a minimal way. Decision trees random forests and gini inefficiencyThe core algorithm behind boruta is random forests. A decision tree is a sequence of steps decisions or splits that are calcuated at training time. Background Minimal optimal feature selection versus all relevant feature selectionBasically boruta is an algorithm designed to sovle what the paper calls the all relevant problem finding a subset of features from the dataset which are relevant to given classification task.
