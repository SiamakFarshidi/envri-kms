Perhaps they are all scam reviews or the density of the books in that field are just that _more_. Fixing the name for every Harry Potter series to be just J. Which are the books with the highest reviews 18 4. gif KMeans clustering is a type of unsupervised learning which groups unlabelled data. The green squares are the centroids for the given clusters. Computing K means with K 5 thus taking it as 5 clusters assigning each sample to a cluster Vector Quantisation some plotting using numpy s logical indexing red circles blue circles yellow circles magenta circles black circles Computing K means with K 8 thus taking it as 8 clusters assigning each sample to a cluster Vector Quantisation some plotting using numpy s logical indexing red circles blue circles yellow circles magenta circles black circles ID for the Book 5. And the beauty shines when observing the plot. The goal is to find groups in data. Let s fix this just for the sake of brevity with all the numerous listings her books are sure to have. Alternate scraping solution when both the API s fails Gathering the data for the year column for the books from their ISBN 13 values Trying out with goodreads api now Going with webscraping Extracting year with regex The finction for getting the final dataframe for the charts Finding the top 15 authors with the most number of books Removing Any null values Draw a circle now Equal Aspect ratio ensures that pie is drawn as a circle Checking for any relation between them. Which are the books with the highest reviews From all the above inferences we can fundamentally decide that although the reviews matter there can t be any specific relation between them and the ranking for all the books Topic Modelling KMeans Clustering without outliers http shabal. Loading required libraries with installation 1 2. Getting basic ideas about the data 2 3. These books have come up in this database over and over again with various publication editions. KMeans Clustering with optimisaztion 21 5. The average rating seems to become sparse while the number keeps on decreasing. Let s remove them and form inferences KMeans with optimisation Finding the outliers and then removing them. Creating specific functions to help in finding the book names Get index from Title Get ID from partial name Because not everyone can remember all the names Print the similar books from the feature dataset. Rowling predominantly in the head of this dataframe. Books having scores near 5 are extremely rareSurprisingly it can be seen that the ratings between 0 and 1 are much more numerous in number leading to a conclusion that if a person does read a book and end up hating it it ll still get a minimum of around 2 stars just for the effort they put up for reading the book.

Seems like some books do age well and these have just braved the flow of time. Yet when we glance at the first and fifth book of Harry Potter we can also notice that there has been a ridiculously huge margin in the number of readers ratings for the books signifying that there were people who did not pick up the next book in the series and or only found the first book to touch their hearts up to an extent to drop a vote Which are the authors with most books We can see from the above plot that Agatha Christie has the most number of books in the list although a lot of them might be just various publications for the same book considering the fact that her work has been here for quite a while spanning decades. From the above plot now we can see that once the whole system _can_ be classified into clusters. Taking the Ratings_Distribution A self created classifying trend the recommendation system works with the algortihm of K Nearest Neighbors. Creating a books features table based on the Ratings Distribution which classifies the books into ratings scale such as Between 0 and 1 Between 1 and 2 Between 2 and 3 Between 3 and 4 Between 4 and 5Broadly the recommendations then consider the average ratings and ratings cout for the query entered. Which are the authors with most books 7 5. Known for his famous works such as Rita Hayworth and Shawshank which coincidently resides within his best range 1982 1987 Stephen King is a legend in his own rights. x If you liked the kernel do consider upvoting it Finding Number of rows and columns Taking the first 20 If possible please get your own Creating a function to get book details from the ISBN 13 value. KMeans Clustering with outliers 20 2. For the sake of brevity only english language has been used Stephen King We can notice from the plot that Stephen King was at his best in 1987 hitting the peak. The kurtosis of the graph just seems to land between 3 and 4 signifying that for the effort it took to read and the thrilling unputdownable nature of the book the majority of the ratings lie between 3 and 4. Is there a relationship between ratings and ratings count 17 11. Which are the top 10 most rated books 6 4. jpg crop 1xw 1xh center top resize 500 Background checkup. Topic Modelling 19 1. With this I attepmt to find a relationship or groups between the rating count and average rating value. It could lead to the fact that most of the people seem to prefer books with a moderate amount of pages and that thicker books seems to scare people away. Most of her books have performed admirably still staying well above 4 presumably because of Poirot and his fabulous skills Might even give Sherlock a run for his money From this chart it s perhaps safe to assume that the performance of her books were perhaps the least volatile Dan Brown Presumably a fan favourite for the current generation Dan Brown seems to write fabulous thrillers with a knack for them to still retain the potential to be brilliant page turners. Agatha Christie 10 3. Stephen King 9 2. Infact apart from a few such as Catcher in the Rye and Animal Farm all of the books seem to be from a series of books getting the notion into our head that once people begin most of them seem to dive in with the notion of completing it. Book Recommendation Engine 22 Loading libraries with installation Getting Basic Ideas Let s begin the journey there seems to be J. The phenomenon for this era the book which sold the most copies in the world. As the count increases the rating would end up near the cluster given above. What is the rating distribution for the books From the given plot we can infer that Majority of the ratings lie near 3. Rowling And finally Harry Potter. For the given list if I ask recommendations for The Catcher in the Rye five books related to it would appear. All above four brilliantly defying the rating trends which nearly all seem to follow.

With over a hundred thousand ratings there are books which just tend to become popular as each day seems to pass. There might be a relationship but the reviews seem to be predominant amongst books with decent ratings. I ll use the Elbow Curve method for the best way of finding the number of clusters for the dataFrom the above plot we can see that the elbow lies around the value K 5 so that s what we will attempt it withWe can see from the above plot that because of two outliers the whole clustering algortihm is skewed. What is the distribution of books across languages 5 3. With such a vast overwhelming number of factors we ll go over such demographics Does any relationship lie between ratings and the total ratings given Where do majority of the books lie in terms of ratings Does reading a book really bring forth bias for the ratings Do authors tend to perform same over time with all their newer books Or do they just fizzle out. From the list we can see that most of the books from the given chart are either old steadfast classics or books which are usually assigned to schools. Recommendation Engine Having seen the clustering we can infer that there can be some recommendations which can happen with the relation between Average Rating and Ratings Count. Based on that logic let s explore the scenario in that range Analysis From the given plot we can infer that the highest ratings ever given usually are for books with the page range of 200 400 peaking near 250. Is there a relationship between number of pages and ratings 16 10. Based on a book entered by the user the nearest neighbours to it would be classified as the books which the user might like. Which are the top 10 highly rated authors 13 7. For a better outlook let s consider the count around 2000000 ratingsFrom the graph we can see that there can be a potential relationship between the average rating and ratings count. As the rating count seems to decrease the average rating seems to become sparser with higher volatility and less accuracy. com images j k rowling book quote 1531932701. com max 1400 1 j95msWf8y2B_cbQVMzxFWg. What s in this kernel 1. Which are the top 10 most rated books 1 We can see that the beginning books of the series usually have most of the ratings i. This uses the Indices metric from the nearest neighbors to pick the books. Yet as we ve all come to know and love her there s Mary here too. 2 Harry potter s first book dominates the section by having more than 5000000 ratings. Is there a relationship between ratings and ratings count There seem to be some outliers present in this. From the names in the list we can again gather that most of the authors have either been writing for decades churning numerous books from time to time or are authors who are regaled as the classics in our history. Agatha Christie Agatha Christie has been a legend throughout the course over the years. It s also impressive to note the vast dominance Tolkien has over the competition easily dethroning any other competiton while being above 4. The min max scaler is used to reduce the bias which would have been present due to some books having a massive amount of features yet the rest having less. In classification problems to predict the label of a instance we first find k closest instances to the given one based on the distance metric and based on the majority voting scheme or weighted majority voting neighbors which are closer are weighted higher we predict the labels. Yet from the data yet obtained it can be observed that he has the least ratings amongst the four chosen authors yet he is consistent. Is there a relationship between number of pages and ratings Analysis This plot doesn t give that much of an accurate inference due to the massive presence of outliers for books above 1000 pages for the _maximum_ density is between 0 1000 pages. Min Max scaler would find the median for them all and equalize it. It seems hype does play a role in this.
