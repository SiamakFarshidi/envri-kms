While the lines extending from the bottom and top of the real body is known as the lower and upper shadows or wick. 4 StationarityA stationary time series is one whose statistical properties such as mean variance autocorrelation etc. There are always better models. But in my experience the best models for time series forecasting are LSTM based Recurrent Neural Networks. 1 AR models An autoregressive AR model is a representation of a type of random process as such it is used to describe certain time varying processes in nature economics etc. Humidity in different world cities3. If there is any suggestion or any specific topic you would like me to cover kindly mention that in the comments. 2 Cleaning and preparing time series data How to prepare data Google stocks data doesn t have any missing values but humidity data does have its fair share of missing values. But when the market is Bearish the closing price is lower than it opened then the body is usually coloured either black or red. When the market is Bullish the closing price is higher than it opened then the body is coloured typically white or green. VAR models generalize the univariate autoregressive model AR model by allowing for more than one evolving variable. Introduction to date and time 1. 4 Comaring two or more time series 2. This kernel is prepared to be a container of many broad topics in the field of time series analysis. 5 Window functions 2. Periods represent an interval in time. Just forecasting and predictions for this one. 9 as AR parameter is 0. com courses introduction to time series analysis in python Visualizing Time Series Data in Python https www. It is quite useful when creating your own time series attribute for pre existing data or arranging the whole data around the time series attribute created by you. The open and close prices are represented by the vertical positioning of tick marks that appear on the left representing the open price and on right representing the close price sides of the high low vertical line. It involves aggregation of existing data. 2 Stock returns 2. So you can t tell how volatile trading was within that single time period. Rolling Same size and sliding Expanding Contains all prior valuesNow observe that rolling mean plot is a smoother version of the original plot. Each shadow represents the highest or lowest price traded during the time period represented. Both of these models are fitted to time series data either to better understand the data or to predict future points in the series forecasting. 8 Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation 3. Importing libraries Above is a special style template for matplotlib highly useful for visualizing time series data asfreq method is used to convert a time series to a specified frequency. Data being used 1. 5 Using date_range What is date_range and how is it useful date_range is a method that returns a fixed frequency datetimeindex. Predicting the modelsy is predicted plot. On each single time period an OHLC Charts plots a symbol that represents two ranges the highest and lowest prices traded and also the opening and closing price on that single time period for example in a day. 2 Cleaning and preparing time series data 1. But let s try google stocks. Candlestick Charts help reveal the market psychology the fear and greed experienced by sellers and buyers through the various indicators such as shape and colour but also by the many identifiable patterns that can be found in Candlestick Charts. Partial Autocorrelation The partial autocorrelation function can be interpreted as a regression of the series against its past lags. AR 1 model Rt \u03bc \u03d5Rt 1 \u03b5t As RHS has only one lagged value Rt 1 this is called AR model of order 1 where \u03bc is mean and \u03b5 is noise at time t If \u03d5 1 it is random walk. The main rectangle in the symbol is known as the real body which is used to display the range between the open and close price of that time period. Random WalkA random walk is a mathematical object known as a stochastic or random process that describes a path that consists of a succession of random steps on some mathematical space such as the integers. 2 Unobserved components 4. Else if \u03d5 0 it is white noise. ARIMA models are applied in some cases where data show evidence of non stationarity where an initial differencing step corresponding to the integrated part of the model can be applied one or more times to eliminate the non stationarity. com methods candlestick_chart. If \u03d5 is ve there is momentum. 3 Dynamic Factor models 1. 7 Shifting and lags 1. Although the symbols used in Candlestick Charts resemble a Box Plot they function differently and therefore are not to be confused with one another. Each symbol represents the compressed trading activity for a single time period a minute hour day month etc. 9 Predicting simulated AR 1 model Predicting humidity level of Montreal Predicting closing prices of google Forecasting and predicting montreal humidity Forecasting and predicting microsoft stocks volume Predicting the microsoft stocks volume Predicting closing price of Google and microsoft calculating error Predicting closing price of Google calculating error Predicting closing price of Google calculating error Predicting closing price of Google and microsoft calculating error. I am doing this only after completing various courses in this field. 6 State space methods 4. Source Quora https www. com courses manipulating time series data in python Introduction to Time Series Analysis in Python https www. 1 Importing time series data How to import data First we import all the datasets needed for this kernel. 7 Shifting and lagsWe can shift index by desired number of periods with an optional time frequency. Open high low close Charts or OHLC Charts are used as a trading tool to visualise and analyse the price changes over time for securities currencies stocks bonds commodities etc. As microsoft has p value 0. The following model shows a possible scenario Source http support. com watch v _vQ0W_qXMxk State space models https www. 3 ARMA modelsAutoregressive moving average ARMA models provide a parsimonious description of a weakly stationary stochastic process in terms of two polynomials one for the autoregression and the second for the moving average. The required time series column is imported as a datetime column using parse_dates parameter and is also selected as index of the dataframe using index_col parameter. htm etsug_ucm_details01. 1 SARIMA models 4. First we used ffill parameter which propagates last valid observation to fill gaps. Here it is monthly frequency. 3 Visualizing the datasets 1. Partial AutocorrelationThough it is statistically signficant partial autocorrelation after first 2 lags is very low. 1 Importing time series data 1. html Stay tuned for more And don t forget to upvote and comment. Sigh A lot of cleaning is required. The terms can be interpreted the same way as a standard linear regression that is the contribution of a change in that particular lag while holding others constant. 6 State Space methodsA general state space model is of the formyt Zt\u03b1t dt \u03b5t\u03b1t Tt\u03b1t 1 ct Rt\u03b7twhere yt refers to the observation vector at time t \u03b1t refers to the unobserved state vector at time t and where the irregular components are defined as\u03b5t N 0 Ht \u03b7t N 0 Qt The remaining variables Zt dt Ht Tt ct Rt Qt in the equations are matrices describing the process. 05 null hypothesis is rejected and this is not a random walk. Microsoft Stocks Data3. Candlestick Charts are great for detecting and predicting market trends over time and are useful for interpreting the day to day sentiment of the market through each candlestick symbol s colouring and shape. com What is the difference among auto correlation partial auto correlation and inverse auto correlation while modelling an ARIMA series Autocorrelation As all lags are either close to 1 or at least greater than the confidence interval they are statistically significant. I continue to study more advanced concepts to provide more knowledge and content. Pressure in different world cities 1. 8 Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation Autocorrelation The autocorrelation function ACF measures how a series is correlated with itself at different lags. 3 Dynamic Factor modelsDynamic factor models are flexible models for multivariate time series in which the observed endogenous variables are linear functions of exogenous covariates and unobserved factors which have a vector autoregressive structure. Periods can used to check if a specific event in the given period. It is basically Dickey Fuller test with more lagged changes on RHS. This is achieved by dividing each time series element of all time series by the first element. Some important things1. The unobserved factors may also be a function of exogenous covariates. 8 Resampling Upsampling Time series is resampled from low frequency to high frequency Monthly to daily frequency. 9 AR 2 MA 1 AR parameter 0. 3 Absolute change in successive rows 2. It is cleaned using fillna method with ffill parameter which propagates last valid observation to fill gaps 1. Source Datavizcatalogue https datavizcatalogue. For example the longer the body is the more intense the selling or buying pressure is. These patterns found in Candlestick Charts are useful for displaying price relationships and can be used for predicting the possible future movement of the market. 9 which is what we chose as AR parameter in our first simulated model. Much less rows are left. 0000006510 which is more than 0. The disturbances in the equations for the dependent variables may be autocorrelated. The autoregressive model specifies that the output variable depends linearly on its own previous values and on a stochastic term an imperfectly predictable term thus the model is in the form of a stochastic difference equation. 6 Using to_datetime pandas. We will try to decompose seasonal component of the above decomposed time series. 4 Timestamps and Periods 1. AR 2 model Rt \u03bc \u03d51Rt 1 \u03d52Rt 2 \u03b5t AR 3 model Rt \u03bc \u03d51Rt 1 \u03d52Rt 2 \u03d53Rt 3 \u03b5t Simulating AR 1 model Forecasting a simulated model\u03d5 is around 0. The y axis on an OHLC Chart is used for the price scale while the x axis is the timescale. If \u03d5 is ve there is men reversion. OHLC Charts are useful for interpreting the day to day sentiment of the market and forecasting any future price changes through the patterns produced. Here only 0th 1st and 20th lag are statistically significant. 5 Window functionsWindow functions are used to identify sub periods calculates sub metrics of sub periods. White noiseWhite noise has. You can find a list and description of each pattern here. 6 Using to_datetime 1. Constant mean Constant variance Zero auto correlation at all lagsSee how all lags are statistically insigficant as they lie inside the confidence interval shaded portion. It involves filling or interpolating missing data Downsampling Time series is resampled from high frequency to low frequency Weekly to monthly frequency. My motive is to make this the ultimate reference to time series analysis for beginners and experienced people alike. 7 Candlestick charts 2. Time series decomposition and Random walks 3. MA 1 modelRt \u03bc \u03f5t1 \u03b8\u03f5t 1It translates to Today s returns mean today s noise yesterday s noise As there is only 1 lagged value in RHS it is an MA model of order 1 Simulating MA 1 model Forecasting the simulated MA model Prediction using MA modelsNow for ARMA models. Resampling is cool when used properly. 0003201525 which is less than 0. The frequncy is annual Plotting white noise loc is mean scale is variance Plotting autocorrelation of white noise Augmented Dickey Fuller test on volume of google and microsoft stocks The original non stationary plot The new stationary plot AR 1 MA 1 model AR parameter 0. 1 SARIMA modelsSARIMA models are useful for modeling seasonal time series in which the mean and other statistics for a given season are not stationary across the years. They can also be converted to each other s form. Strong stationarity is a stochastic process whose unconditional joint probability distribution does not change when shifted in time. to_datetime is used for converting arguments to datetime. I may add more regression models soon and there is much more stuff to cover. Their variable names and dimensions are as followsZ design k_endog k_states nobs d obs_intercept k_endog nobs H obs_cov k_endog k_endog nobs T transition k_states k_states nobs c state_intercept k_states nobs R selection k_states k_posdef nobs Q state_cov k_posdef k_posdef nobs In the case that one of the matrices is time invariant so that for example Zt Zt 1 t its last dimension may be of size 1 rather than size nobs. Please bear in mind that Candlestick Charts don t express the events taking place between the open and close price only the relationship between the two prices. 1 Trends Seasonality and Noise 3. The SARIMA model defined constitutes a straightforward extension of the nonseasonal autoregressive moving average ARMA and autoregressive integrated moving average ARIMA models presented 4.

This generic form encapsulates many of the most popular linear time series models see below and is very flexible allowing estimation with missing observations forecasting impulse response functions and much more. In total there are 42 recognised patterns that are divided into simple and complex patterns. 7 Candlestick chartsThis type of chart is used as a trading tool to visualise and analyse the price movements over time for securities derivatives currencies stocks bonds commodities etc. 9 We will take care of MA model later AR 1 MA 1 AR parameter 0. Candlestick Charts display multiple bits of price information such as the open price close price highest price and lowest price through the use of candlestick like symbols. Finance and statistics 2. 4 Timestamps and Periods What are timestamps and periods and how are they useful Timestamps are used to represent a point in time. Prediction using ARMA modelsI am not simulating any model because it s quite similar to AR and MA models. Creating a Timestamp Creating a period Checking if the given timestamp exists in the given period Converting timestamp to period Converting period to timestamp Creating a datetimeindex with daily frequency Creating a datetimeindex with monthly frequency Creating a datetimeindex without specifying start date and using periods Creating a datetimeindex specifying start date end date and periods Let s use pressure data to demonstrate this Shape before resampling downsampling We downsample from hourly to 3 day frequency aggregated using mean Shape after resampling downsampling Shape after resampling upsampling Another way to calculate returns We choose microsoft stocks to compare them with google Plotting before normalization Normalizing and comparison Both stocks start from 100 Rolling window functions Plotting a rolling mean of 90 day window with original High attribute of google stocks Expanding window functions OHLC chart of June 2008 OHLC chart of 2008 OHLC chart of 2008 Candlestick chart of march 2008 Candlestick chart of 2008 Candlestick chart of 2006 2018 Autocorrelation of humidity of San Diego Partial Autocorrelation of humidity of San Diego Partial Autocorrelation of closing price of microsoft stocks Let s take Google stocks High for this Now for decomposition. This is useful when comparing the time series with a past of itself 1. Finance and Statistics 2. All variables in a VAR enter the model in the same way each variable has an equation explaining its evolution based on its own lagged values the lagged values of the other model variables and an error term. You can clearly see how google outperforms microsoft over time. com courses visualizing time series data in python VAR models and LSTM https www. This way both series start at the same point and can be easily compared. AimSince my first week on this platform I have been fascinated by the topic of time series analysis. 1 Percent change 2. com documentation cdl en etsug 66840 HTML default viewer. Non uniform noise that represent outliers and missing values 3. Else if 1 \u03d5 1 it is stationary. ARMA 1 1 model Rt \u03bc \u03d5Rt 1 \u03f5t \u03b8\u03f5t 1 Basically Today s return mean Yesterday s return noise yesterday s noise. 2 MA modelsThe moving average MA model is a common approach for modeling univariate time series. Quite neat Not quite impressive. Trends seasonality and noiseThese are the components of a time series Trend Consistent upwards or downwards slope of a time series Seasonality Clear periodic pattern of a time series like sine funtion Noise Outliers or missing values There is clearly an upward trend in the above plot. Now we will upsample from 3 day frequency to daily frequencyAgain an increase in number of rows. ARIMA model is of the form ARIMA p d q p is AR parameter d is differential parameter q is MA parameter ARIMA 1 0 0 yt a1yt 1 \u03f5t ARIMA 1 0 1 yt a1yt 1 \u03f5t b1\u03f5t 1 ARIMA 1 1 1 \u0394yt a1\u0394yt 1 \u03f5t b1\u03f5t 1 where \u0394yt yt yt 1 Prediction using ARIMA modelTaking the slight lag into account this is a fine model. Google Stocks Data2. diff method can easily convert a non stationary series to a stationary series. On the range symbol the high and low price ranges are represented by the length of the main vertical line. Here a DataFrame is converted to a datetime series. Here is the link https www. Each Candlestick symbol is plotted along a time scale on the x axis to show the trading activity over time. 2 Unobserved componentsA UCM decomposes the response series into components such as trend seasons cycles and the regression effects due to predictor series. 6 OHLC chartsAn OHLC chart is any type of price chart that shows the open high low and close price of a certain time period. Modelling using statsmodels 4. Colour can be assigned to each OHLC Chart symbol to distinguish whether the market is bullish the closing price is higher then it opened or bearish the closing price is lower then it opened. Weak stationarity is a process where mean variance autocorrelation are constant throughout the timeStationarity is important as non stationary series that depend on time have too many parameters to account for when modelling the time series. Modelling using statstools 4. Source statsmodels https www. You can also see the uniform seasonal change. ARMA model shows much better results than AR and MA models. 4 ARIMA models 4. Time series decomposition and Random Walks 3. It s the fusion of AR and MA models. While a very short body would indicate that there is very little price movement in that time period and represents consolidation. 5 Using date_range 1. The moving average model specifies that the output variable depends linearly on the current and various past values of a stochastic imperfectly predictable term. are all constant over time. 5 VAR modelsVector autoregression VAR is a stochastic process model used to capture the linear interdependencies among multiple time series. VAR modeling does not require as much knowledge about the forces influencing a variable as do structural models with simultaneous equations The only prior knowledge required is a list of variables which can be hypothesized to affect each other intertemporally. I have prepared a detailed tutorial for that. Now google has p value 0. com methods OHLC_chart. If you like my work be sure to upvote press the like button this kernel so it looks more relevant and meaningful to the community. Then we use bfill to propogate next valid observation to fill gaps. In general if we talk about stocks Today s Price Yesterday s Price Noise Pt Pt 1 \u03b5t Random walks can t be forecasted because well noise is random.
