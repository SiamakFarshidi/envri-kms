Since we are creating multiple dataset to experiment with dataset version control can be useful. csv and 7781 rows in train_fp. The three transforms that this notebook uses are STFT based spectrogram Log of the spectrogram MFCC based spectrogram_Sneak Peak of the dataset_ img https i. png In a different kernel we shall consume these artifacts to train neural network based models. We will save the dataset as W B artifacts. com github wandb examples blob master colabs wandb artifacts Pipeline_Versioning_with_W 26B_Artifacts. unique songtype_id initialize a W B run create an artifact to add file s and meaningful description. com c rfcx species audio detection discussion 197866. Save the artifact version to W B and mark it as the output of this run which specie s does the sample audio file belong number of samples per FFT the duration of each slice shift normalize image high sr for less rounding errors this way length of slice initialize a W B run declare which artifact we ll be using we can eithr download the csv file from the artifact_csv or use the one which is opened. Number of train and test audio recordsThe numbers don t add up and thus a closer look at the csv files is required. We are discarding train_fp. Idea Transform the audio data to get one channel image data like spectrogram. General description Number of ClassesPointers There are 24 species of birds and frogs together. com samcantor9 getting started with rainforest audio data by Sam Cantor https www. STFT based spectrogram 2. Prepare dataset and save as W B artifacts https www. csv file Get the postition to slice the audio spectrogram log_spectrogram mel_spectrogram generate image by stacking three transforms normalize image scale image to 0 1 scale up to 0 255 to save in bmp format convert to PIL Image and save in bmp format save the directory as an artifact Save the artifact version to W B let W B know that this run is complete. Imports and Setups Simple EDALet s briefly investigate csv files. Dataset Creation and W B ArtifactsLearn more about the artifacts through this easy to understand Colab notebook https colab. A peek into the file. You can later use the same to download the dataset and train a model. For more on submission. For clarity or more information on train_tp vs train_fp check out this disussion thread https www. Save the csv files as W B Artifacts Audio to Image TransformationsWe will quickly look at the standard audio to image transformation techniques. STFT based log spectrogramSImply convert the spectrogram to log scale. com artifacts number of classes. The transformations are based on this Kaggle kernel https www. Mel Frequency Ceptral Coefficients MFCCs IDEA Stack all three transformations such that we get a standard 3 channel image. csv check out this discussion thread https www. Following this widely used and successful method this kernel builds an interesting image dataset using audio dataset. The reason for tp fp to not add up to the number of audion files is that there are some files annotated with tp as well as fp. We have two annotation files train_tp. One of the most used method for audio based classification is to convert 1D audio signal to 2D image representation and use well established computer vision techniques. com c rfcx species audio detection discussion 200757. _Sneak Peak of our dataset version control_ img https i. songtype_id is the same species using different frequencies as annotated. There are 1216 rows in train_tp. Let us see the number of training audio files. Take three such transforms and stack them together to form 3 channel image. png Overview Generate multiple image datasets using different values of the hyperparameters n_fft and hop_length. Dataset related hyperparametersI created three variants of the dataset by changing the hyperparameters by simply running the jupyter cells you can create a new dataset and save as artifacts.
