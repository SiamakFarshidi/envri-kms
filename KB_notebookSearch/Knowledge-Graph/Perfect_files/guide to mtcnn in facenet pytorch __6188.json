In the following example we use MTCNN to detect multiple faces in 1. detect method on a single image. The following example demonstrates the use of the. For single images pass a single path string e. Margin adjustmentDepending on your downstream processing and how fakes can be identified you may want to add more or less of a margin around the detected faces. Preventing image normalizationBy default the MTCNN module of facenet pytorch applies fixed image standardization to faces before returning so they are well suited for the package s face recognition model. For this competition it will be best to set select_largest False to ensure detected faces are ordered according to detection probability rather than size. detect method will always return all detected bounding boxes and optional landmarks in an image. jpg See example below. Our method achieves superior accuracy over the state of the art techniques on the challenging FDDB and WIDER FACE benchmark for face detection and AFLW benchmark for face alignment while keeps real time performance. Recent studies show that deep learning approaches can achieve impressive performance on these two tasks. This notebook aims to demonstrate the different ways to use the MTCNN face detection module of facenet pytorch. In this paper we propose a deep cascaded multi task framework which exploits the inherent correlation between them to boost up their performance. 02878 the MTCNN network is able to simultaneously propose bounding boxes five point facial landmarks and detection probabilities. A single batch of frames and1. This is compatible with both single images and batch processing. jpg and videoname _ frame _1. Multiple faces in a single imageUsing MTCNN as above will only return a single face from each frame or None if none are detected. Each image in the batch may have one or more faces detected. using the forward method for those familiar with pytorch will return torch tensors containing the detected face s rather than just the bounding boxes. Originally reported in Joint Face Detection and Alignment using Multi task Cascaded Convolutional Networks https arxiv. Notebook demonstrating combined use of face detection and recognition https www. In addition in the learning process we propose a new online hard sample mining strategy that can improve the performance automatically without manual sample selection. Saving face datasetsOther resources 1. This is acheived by setting keep_all True Batched detection facenet pytorch is also capable of performing face detection on batches of images typically providing considerable speed up. To create an MTCNN detector that runs on the GPU instantiate the model with device cuda 0 or equivalent. Saving face datasetsIn order to save detected faces directly to file use MTCNN s save_path argument in the forward function. The following example demonstrates how to show bounding boxes and facial landmarks in every frame in a video. Its use will be described below also. videoname _ frame. This is to enable using the module easily as the first stage of a facial recognition pipeline in which the faces are passed directly to an additional network or algorithm. facenet pytorch includes an efficient cuda ready implementation of MTCNN that will be demonstrated in this notebook. Since some of the videos in the dataset contain more than one face you will likely want to return all detected faces as any all of them may have been modified. A batch should be structured as list of PIL images of equal dimension. The FastMTCNN algorithm https www. Multiple faces in a single image1. jpg For batches of images pass a list of path strings one for each frame When multiple faces are detected in a single image additional faces are each saved with an incremental integer appended to the end of the save path e. detect returns the true bounding boxes so the margin can be applied subsequently by the user if desired. Unlike the forward method shown in each of examples above the. Bounding boxes and facial landmarks1. The following topics will be covered 1. com timesler facenet pytorch 1. This is controlled using the margin argument.

Every frame of a videoThe following example uses a similar approach to detect all faces in all frames in a video. com timesler facial recognition model in pytorch 1. The facenet pytorch github repo https github. Note that the margin argument if used when creating the MTCNN detector is not used in the detect method. In particular our framework adopts a cascaded structure with three stages of carefully designed deep convolutional networks that predict face and landmark location in a coarse to fine manner. If you want to get out images that look more normal to the human eye this normalization can be prevented by creating the detector with post_process False. In order to return the detected boxes instead and optionally the facial landmarks see the MTCNN. Preventing image normalization1. Taken from the original paper Face detection and alignment in unconstrained environments are challenging due to various poses illuminations and occlusions. Bounding boxes and facial landmarksTo return bounding boxes and facial landmarks from MTCNN instead of calling the mtcnn object directly call mtcnn.
