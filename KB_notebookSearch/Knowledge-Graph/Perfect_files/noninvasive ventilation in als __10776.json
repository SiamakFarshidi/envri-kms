BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF NIV From the first non controlled studies published in 1993 to the randomized controlled trial published in 2006 many studies have shown that NIV significantly improves survival quality of life and cognitive performance in ALS despite disease progression. No site of NIV initiation has been demonstrated to be superior to another with home ambulatory care and even telemonitoring all reporting successful establishment of NIV. These survival times are only examples extrapolated from selected latest publications in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients. png https onlinelibrary. Discontinuation of NIV Although ventilatory support can meaningfully extend life the patient sometimes requests cessation of NIV when allowed by local legislation. NIV in ALS has been considerably improved as a result of application of all of these measures avoiding the need for tracheostomy in the very great majority of cases. 13525Series Editors Amanda Piper and Chung Ming Chu Non invasive ventilation NIV has become an essential part of the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS since 2006. This improvement is even observed in patients with bulbar muscle involvement muscles controlling speech mastication and swallowing considered to be poor candidates for NIV in 2006 with a survival gain of 19 months over those with non bulbar phenotypes. This type of situation must be anticipated which necessitates rigorous and carefully appropriate drug treatment. NIV in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis The when and how of the matterAuthors Capucine Morelot Panzini Ga\u00eblle Bruneteau Jesus Gonzalez BermejoFirst published 25 March 2019 https doi. As discussed below only a few studies have proposed the so called early ventilation prior to onset of hypoventilation. 13525 CRITERIA FOR INITIATION OF NIV All studies published since 1993 have proposed NIV in patients with daytime or nocturnal hypoventilation. 13525 NON VENTILATORY CAUSES OF FAILURE OF NIV IN ALS Bronchial Congestion Secondary to Impaired Cough Concomitant impairment of the diaphragm expiratory muscles and airways makes cough very ineffective in ALS. However discontinuation of NIV will inevitably be accompanied by severe symptoms or even true acute respiratory distress. Unique data concerning the long term adjustment of NIV in ALS show that correction of leaks management of obstructive apnoea and adaptation to the patient s degree of ventilator dependence improve the prognosis. If death does not occur rapidly a doctor or nurse should frequently visit the patient s room or may need to be continuously present in some cases. The survival gain as a result of NIV has been estimated to be 7 months. Presentation of NIV Mechanical ventilation is an important step in the life of ALS patients. 13525 This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed It is defined by the kaggle python Docker image https github. Authors also demonstrated a dramatic reduction of survival due to diaphragmatic involvement 217 vs 620 days providing a major physiological argument in favour of the use of NIV in ALS and confirming results of earlier trials. This is much better than that of vital capacity VC which has a sensitivity of only 58 for a value 50. NIV very significantly improves survival quality of life and cognitive performances. read_csv Input data files are available in the read only. 82 According to one study patients may experience distress and pain during the last month of life and often receive suboptimal treatment. The best examination at present to detect hypoventilation is the SNIFF TEST with a sensitivity of 97 for a SNIFF 40 cm H2O. Following these studies diaphragmatic involvement of ALS and the benefit provided by NIV have been the subject of numerous publications and considerable improvements in therapy. Increase inspiratory time. 13525 TRACHEOSTOMY IS NOT SYSTEMATICALLY THE NEXT STEP AFTER NIV Tracheostomy has been shown to markedly improve survival as recently highlighted by Stephen Hawking s very long term survival with quality of life considered to be satisfactory by patients although less so by caregivers. Various drugs can be used atropine scopolamine and belladonna tincture but salivary gland radiotherapy has been shown to be very effective and should be proposed to these patients even in patients already treated by NIV. Some patients and their families nevertheless request tracheostomy and they must be informed as completely as possible about the consequences of this decision ideally as early as possible to avoid performing tracheostomy in an acute setting when the patient and the family have not had time to discuss this option. 13525Sniff Nasal Inspiratory Pressures SNIP HOW SHOULD ALS PATIENTS BE VENTILATED Site of initiation of NIV NIV can be initiated in any setting experienced in NIV. com kaggle docker python For example here s several helpful packages to load linear algebra data processing CSV file I O e. Undernutrition secondary to swallowing disorders and the need for gastrostomy Swallowing disorders requiring as feeding gastrostomy can occur after commencing NIV. 13525 PALLIATIVE CARE AND DISCONTINUATION OF NIV Dyspnoea and end of life End of life is accompanied by a number of symptoms dyspnoea weakness physical fatigue decreased activity psychological fatigue and lack of motivation. Setting adjustments available on modern insufflator exsufflators can be proposed in severe bulbar ALS patients Ensure triggering on every insufflation. Decrease inspiratory pressure. https onlinelibrary. The absence of cough when left untreated is associated with marked excess mortality. Decrease inspiratory flow. It is important to ensure the continuous presence of a doctor or a nurse in the patient s room after stopping ventilatory support to allow a rapid response when the doses need to be increased to reassure the family about the significance of any respiratory pauses or agonal gasps which despite their spectacular nature must not be interpreted as signs of suffering. input directory For example running this by clicking run or pressing Shift Enter will list all files under the input directory You can write up to 20GB to the current directory kaggle working that gets preserved as output when you create a version using Save Run All You can also write temporary files to kaggle temp but they won t be saved outside of the current session specify None if want to read whole file SNIP test Bland Altman analysis Sniff nasal inspiratory pressures SNIP Let s plot The Highest SNIP Achieved Maior SNIP Alcan\u00e7ado customizing the QQ_plot. The initial NIV settings are simple but progression of the disease ventilator dependence and upper airway involvement sometimes make long term adjustment of NIV more difficult with a major impact on survival. Ten years later with improvement of the quality of NIV and multidisciplinary management NIV now provides a median improvement in survival of more than 13 months. More advanced use of NIV also requires pulmonologists to master the associated end of life palliative care as well as the modalities of discontinuing ventilation when it becomes unreasonable. More reliable measurements are obtained with a mask rather than a mouthpiece especially for patients with bulbar disease. No difference in terms of efficacy has been demonstrated between volume assist control ventilation in which the patient receives a predefined volume of gas and pressure assist control ventilation in which partial pressure assistance is provided. Outpatient initiation of NIV can save time and consequently improve patient survival. Choice of equipment and settings No particular mode of ventilation has been demonstrated to be superior. Congestion due to excess salivation Excess salivation can be a specific cause of failure of NIV in ALS. Various solutions have been proposed including endoscopic gastrostomy with NIV support but this is difficult to perform in patients with severe bulbar lesions who are be unable to control mouth leaks during NIV or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy with NIV support which can sometimes be impossible in the presence of very advanced diaphragmatic dysfunction with intrathoracic stomach. It can be a feared and traumatic step for the patient and their family with many associating ventilation with tracheostomy and end of life. From a database comprising more than 600 patients showed that in more than 80 of cases NIV was initiated at a stage of daytime hypoventilation with a median PaCO2 arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 48 mm Hg. Botulinum toxin injection into the salivary glands is difficult to perform and only has a temporary effect. However all guidelines recommend that the indication for NIV be based on pulmonary function parameters nocturnal oximetry or even plasma bicarbonate although these recommendations are not contradictory. Survival Times and Mechanical VentilationIllustration of the different expected survival times depending of the quality of mechanical ventilation. However three monthly assessments of PCO2 partial pressure of carbon dioxide are not practical due to the painful and invasive nature of arterial blood gases and or the cost of percutaneous measurements. The current trend especially in view of the major motor disability of these patients is to avoid hospitalization and all outpatient approaches are highly appreciated by patients and are associated with health cost savings. Harnesses and masks fitted with security systems can also be useful in motor disabled patients especially ALS patients when the mask needs to be removed in an emergency. Non ventilatory factors also impact the efficacy of NIV and various solutions have been described and must be applied including cough assist techniques control of excess salivation and renutrition. In view of the nature and rapid progression of ALS three monthly assessments are necessary to determine the appropriate time to initiate NIV. 13525 INDICATION OF NIV Some patients are able to use their accessory muscles during REM sleep as a result of an as yet unexplained phenotypic change. com cms asset ff6a659d 0fef 4a03 9407 979abfa3caeb resp13525 fig 0001 m.
