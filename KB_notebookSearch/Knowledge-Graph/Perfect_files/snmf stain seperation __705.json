Stain SeperationThis is an implementation of stain seperation algorithm as described in STRUCTURE PRESERVED COLOR NORMALIZATION FOR HISTOLOGICAL IMAGES IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging 2015. Still I hope you can make use of it. Otherwise change beer_lambert_transform function to use approperiate value. Remove white pixel from stain color map. I used it to seperate stains into different channels and train my network based these new images.
