Load DataLoad CSV data Install OpenBabelThe installation method was demonstrated in Molecule with OpenBabel https www. Hence it is fast and in the range of the allowed options for the competition. xyz files the ones provided in the structures directory Build bonding scheme groovy baby Compute partial charges with several builtin methodsHumm this last one is really interresting as it provides a quick way of computing atoms local charge with a method based on linear algebra. The most promising method is Electronegativity Equalization Method EEM which is describeed in this paper High quality and universal empirical atomic charges for chemoinformatics applications https www. input champs scalar coupling structures container for output DF container for output DF fill data for output DF calculate open babel charge for each method consistency correlation plots. org wiki Main_Page Package allow to Read. png In this kernel I will explore an alternative way of calculating local mulliken charges. gov pmc articles PMC4667495 Changelog v7 Include test molecules in a separate dataframe and updated the external dataset accordingly v5 building of output dataset ob_charges with train molecules v4 first public version Definition of partial chargeThere is no such thing as a space localized electron they are rather something like a wave all around atomic nuclei. But there are some models for getting an approximation of the average charge at the location of atoms. Hence the fact that some models differ from the data in the table mulliken_charges does not mean that it is systematically worse for the end purpose to predict coupling. You may be interrested only if you wish to incorportate these features in your model. com jmtest molecule with openbabel Load Mulliken Charges from train set Compute atom partial charges with Open Babel Compare Mulliken charges to Open Babel EEM Write Output dataframes ConclusionOpen Babel local charge estimation is worth a try in our models Best match is method eem and some of its variants Note that some outliers in the scatter plots come from different convention for how ionization charge is located inside the molecule. linear algebra data processing CSV file I O e. This is this what is computed in this kernel under the name partial charge. For example COO can have 1 charge set on one O or let it be shared by both oxygens. read_csv differentiate train and test set ensure mulliken charges are in same order as for partial charges def read_ob_molecule molecule_name datadir.
