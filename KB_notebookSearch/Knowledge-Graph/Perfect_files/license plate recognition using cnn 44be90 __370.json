In this tutorial I will show how to code a license plate recognizer for Indian license plates using deep learning and some image processing. detects numberplates and returns the coordinates and dimensions of detected license plate s contours. finally representing the detected contours by drawing rectangles around the edges. the function detects and perfors blurring on the number plate. Testing the above function \u56fe\u7247 Getting plate prom the processed image Match contours to license plate or character template Find all contours in the image Retrieve potential dimensions Check largest 5 or 15 contours for license plate or character respectively detects contour in binary image and returns the coordinates of rectangle enclosing it checking the dimensions of the contour to filter out the characters by contour s size stores the x coordinate of the character s contour to used later for indexing the contours extracting each character using the enclosing rectangle s coordinates.
