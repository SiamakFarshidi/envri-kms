The data is loading the model is training I m still hoping for clarification on the submission as there is a mismatch between the smaple_submission. As losses go definitely check out IOU Jaccard Intersection over union Lovasz https arxiv. The general idea is Black Air Gray Fluids and Tissue White Bone and SolidsSo the issue is that an air enclosure may just be a mild disturbance in the chest xray. net pictures 50000 nahled anatomy high tech. Futuristic view of human https www. The X Ray shows a shadow on the lung. Let s first take a look at the sample images that are available. com schlerp getting to know dicom and the data dataSome ideas that might be helpful Check out Pneumonia X Ray Challenge https www. Here s the Wikipedia https en. Particularly it may be benefitial not training on 1024x1024 images but patches of the image. Better ideas are to use proper train validation splits possibly with stratification https en. It becomes very evident that we have to be careful about the top right marker on the image. Then we ll look at 3 images and the masks that come with it. This kernel is just giving some starting info and how to look at the data with the given tools. They re excellent on small ish datasets and particularly on image segmentation. com toregil a lung u net in keras might be interesting but there are many on kaggle on lung segmentation mine on salt segmentation https www. 02579 Data Distillation https arxiv. com c rsna pneumonia detection challenge https www. Play around with it in some of the other images it is definitely more visible than in others. Here we actually get to do dense prediction. com c rsna pneumonia detection challenge Use TFRecords https www. com jesperdramsch intro to seismic salt and how to geophysics or the Carvana https www. com c tgs salt identification challenge discussion 63984 latest 425973 are Look at the masks There be dragons. com jesperdramsch intro to seismic salt and how to geophysics What is DICOM Dicom is a format that has metadata as well as Pixeldata attached to it. You ll be able to transfer this kernel to downloaded data to visualize other bits and explore their metadata. For example running this by clicking run or pressing Shift Enter will list the files in the input directory Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output. I m hiding some cells for readability below just fork the kernel or click the Show code on the right to see imports etc. com kaggle docker python For example here s several helpful packages to load in linear algebra data processing CSV file I O e. Comment this out to see all Starting index of images Total number of images to show Get train images and masks Assume missing masks are empty masks. The different L may mess with our data. Also thanks to Ehsan make sure to transpose the masks Vanilla UnetSo how would we work the data on GCP I d suggest a very nice Unet https arxiv. Predict empty masks Binary Classification Break down problem Male Female Networks Multiclass Active learning of sorting out easy and hard to classify images Confidence Intervals Pesudo labeling semi suervised learning knowledge distillation adversarial training Additional labeling or supervisory signal Clustering KNN for image patches This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed It is defined by the kaggle python docker image https github. net tutorial _images unet. 03237 is the LB loss. read_csv Input data files are available in the. There are many others you may try but maybe this one will get you started. 08790 and Focal methods https arxiv. com lyonzy convert dicom images to tfrecords Check Out Unets https www. Personally I can t really make out how to find the pneumothorax in the images. And that shadow is air. How do the masks look like First let s look at all the sample images. You ll probably enjoy Hypercolumns https arxiv. We can see different modes of collection. Especially Heng CherKeng https www. org wiki DICOM article for it. In challenges I link below only bounding boxes were available. Analyze the metadata There be leakage. csv and the provided data. 04597 maybe use a pretty pre trained encoder instead of the following. This isn t working as well as I d like it to but I ll leave it here for now. You will know about the gender and age of the patient as well as info how the image is sampled and generated. Build PatchesReshape to get non overlapping patches. Below I extract some basic info with an image. io preprocessing image instead. com hengck23 learned a bunch from them and the list below is heavily influenced by them. Your patient comes in. What s a Pneumothorax https en. Quite useful to programatically read. Learnings from Other Segmentation ChallengesThese are of course some learnings I gained but they are from the amazing kagglers in all the links so please give them the credits. org wiki Pneumothorax Problem is in an X Ray air is usually the thing you ignore. Some common tricks on kaggle image segmentation https www. http deeplearning. If not treated a collapsed lung ish or air on the wrong side of the lung can result in death. This kernel https www. jpg In this challenge we get chest xrays and masks. 10180 in your Upsampling and even sprinkle in some Stochastic Weight Averaging https towardsdatascience. 04440 maybe some Global Attention https arxiv. Sources I used and further reading https www. Considering convolutional neural networks are exceptional at identifying abnormalities we may want them to take a look as not to miss these tiny abnormalities. com c carvana image masking challenge challenge. jpg Load Full DatasetThis is the point I shake my fist at unstripped strings. com stochastic weight averaging a new way to get state of the art results in deep learning c639ccf36a. 02002 although Dice https arxiv. Train a scrappy networkDefinitely work in progress though. Could it be usable leakage as it points to the hospital it was taken at Yes yes it could but I m sure Kaggle took care of this.
