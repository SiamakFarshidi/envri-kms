CNN LSTM for Time Series Forecasting Input shape samples subsequences timesteps features. Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting The goal of this notebook is to develop and compare different approaches to time series problems. The content here was inspired by this article at machinelearningmastery. com dimitreoliveira time series forecasting with lstm autoencoders data. com how to get started with deep learning for time series forecasting 7 day mini course that I used as source. Set seeds to make the experiment more reproducible. How to transform a time series dataset into a supervised learning problem Transform the data into a time series problem. How to develop a Multilayer Perceptron model for a univariate time series forecasting problem MLP for Time Series Forecasting. The results are then interpreted by the LSTM layer before the model outputs a prediction. The CNN will be defined to expect 2 timesteps per subsequence with one feature. As such we will split each sample into 2 subsequences of 2 times per subsequence. When using a hybrid CNN LSTM model we will further divide each sample into further subsequences. Data preprocess Reshape from samples timesteps into samples timesteps features. The thing with MLP models is that the model don t take the input as sequenced data so for the model it is just receiving inputs and don t treat them as sequenced data that may be a problem since the model won t see the data with the sequence patter that it has. com how to get started with deep learning for time series forecasting 7 day mini course The benefit of this model is that the model can support very long input sequences that can be read as blocks or subsequences by the CNN model then pieced together by the LSTM model. I hope you learned a few things here leave a feedback and if you liked what you saw make sure to check the article https machinelearningmastery. How to develop a Hybrid CNN LSTM model for a univariate time series forecasting problem CNN LSTM for Time Series Forecasting. The CNN model will interpret each sub sequence and the LSTM will piece together the interpretations from the subsequences. The filter maps are then flattened before being interpreted by a Dense layer and outputting a prediction. LSTM for Time Series Forecasting Now the LSTM model actually sees the input data as a sequence so it s able to learn patterns from sequenced data assuming it exists better than the other ones especially patterns from long sequences. If you want to check out how you can use LSTM as autoencoders and create new features that represent a time series take a look at my other kernel Time series forecasting with deep learning LSTM autoencoders https www. This same reshaped data will be used on the CNN and the LSTM model. t 1 Current timestep t 0 Target timestep t lag Put it all together Drop rows with NaN values Label. CNN for Time Series Forecasting For the CNN model we will use one convolutional hidden layer followed by a max pooling layer.

Comparing models MLP on train and validation CNN on train and validation LSTM on train and validation CNN LSTM on train and validation ConclusionHere you could see some approaches to a time series problem how to develop and the differences between them this is not meant to have a great performance so if you want better results you are more than welcomed to try a few different hyper parameters especially the window size and the networks topology if you do please let me know the results. The entire CNN model is then wrapped in TimeDistributed wrapper layers so that it can be applied to each subsequence in the sample. Input sequence t n. The convolutional layer should be able to identify patterns between the timesteps.
