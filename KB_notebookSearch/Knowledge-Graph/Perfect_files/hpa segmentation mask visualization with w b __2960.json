That s what makes it a more challenging problem statement. We have to know the presence of the cells in an image. ly play with segmentation masks https i. But we also need to differentiate one cell from another cell. ai site overlay visualization tool to interactively visualize all the segmentation mask generated using the provided HPASegmentation tool. Hyper parameters Prepare Dataset Get train. There are a total of 21 806 training images. Create an account on https wandb. Here s the W B report summarizing the results http bit. Is it good In a discussion thread I read that it can accurately segment cells in 90 of test set images. com c human protein atlas image classification 28 organelles were used as labels and the task was to predict image level labels given input image predict the organelles. csv Path to images We will not be needing the green channel to get the segmentation mask as shown in this kernel https www. In this competition the task is to predict cell level labels using signals from image level labels. Initialize Segmentation Model Log Segmentation MasksAfter the above cell is executed head over to the W B project to visualize the segmentation masks and other visualizations. Here s the link to my W B project https wandb. For full cells all the three reference except green channels are required. com CellProfiling HPA Cell Segmentation tool. Learn more about overlay logging here https docs. gov genetics glossary Organelle. Feel free to use Weights and Biases overlay tool to visualize more images. The image level labels point to the presence of that protein in the cells in general. ai it s free Input your personal authentication token key. Thus at the cell level the protein might not be present in the ground truth organelle. The authors have provided with HPA Cell Segmentation https github. In the previous HPA competition https www. That s an excellent baseline to start with and focus on cell level classification. com lnhtrang hpa public data download and hpacellseg. We will visualize a small fraction of the images. Note Since we have silenced the W B logs head over to your W B profile page and open hpa segmentation mask project. Install HPA Cell Segmentation tool. Stack the channels to form image. ai library log images and overlays Image ID Initialize W B Get red blue and yellow channel images. get cell mask resize mask and image log the image as well as the mask log green channel Close W B run. But what are we predicting There s a specific _protein of interest_ signal in the green channel that can be present in an organelle or multiple organelles in each cell. You can get your auth key here https wandb. Get the label For nuclei segmentation only blue channel is required. ai ayush thakur hpa segmentation mask https i. Thus it s instance segmentation. gif In this competition we are provided with image level labels and the task is to classify each cell in a given image into one or multiple labels. Thus each image has multiple numbers of cells. Imports and Setups W B Setup Install wandb. Interesting This calls for cell segmentation. png Install Weights and Biases. In this notebook I will be using Weights and Biases https wandb. Each cell consists of multiple organelles https www.
