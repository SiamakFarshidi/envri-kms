I might update parts of it down the line when I get more GPU hours and some interesting ideas. Problem CategoryFrom the data and objective its is evident that this is a Classification Problem. It keeps me inspired to come up with such starter kernels and share it with the community. jpg About This NotebookThis is a first run through the competition data to try and understand the datatset and realise the problem at hand with some quick EDA and a baseline Model. It s hard to search for a faint needle of alien transmission in the huge haystack of detections from modern technology. Focal Cosine Loss 2. Problem Statement The Breakthrough Listen team at the University of California Berkeley employs the world s most powerful telescopes to scan millions of stars for signs of technology. So without further ado let s now start with some basic imports to take us through this EDALet s observe the class imbalance in the target variable. Why this competition As evident from the problem statement this competition presents an interesting challenge straight out of a Sci Fi movie stuff Also if successful this model should be able to answer one of the biggest questions in science. Because there are no confirmed examples of alien signals to use to train machine learning algorithms the team included some simulated signals. We need to take care of that while building our models. SETI https earthsky. Current methods use two filters to search through the haystack. Second the pipeline discards signals that don t change their frequency because this means that they are probably nearby the telescope. Expected OutcomeGiven a numpy array of signal we should be able to identify it as a positive class signal from an alien lifeform or negative class signal from one of our devices. Use data science skills to help identify anomalous signals in scans of Breakthrough Listen targets. org upl 2020 02 Earth transit zone Breakthrough Listen. The data consist of two dimensional arrays shape 6 273 256 so there may be approaches from computer vision that are promising as well as digital signal processing anomaly detection and more. I hope you have learnt something from this notebook. Grading MetricSubmissions are evaluated on area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed target. com ihelon signal search exploratory data analysis. Any signal that appears in both sets of scans probably isn t coming from the direction of the target star. But we have an option for the approach starting with vanilla ML methods to Computer Vision to Anomaly detection etc. If you liked this notebook and use parts of it in you code please show some support by upvoting this kernel. Let s see some examples of the negative class Now looking at some data of positive class Model Image Augmentation Dataset Metrics Scheduler Data Sampler Loss Functions 1. I have created this notebook as a baseline model which you can easily fork and paly around with to get much better results. Thanks and happy kaggling Asthetics General Visualizations Image Aug Machine Learning Utils Deep Learning Random Seed Initialize Device Optimization Inspired from https www. npy file is placed inside the train directory. First the Listen team intersperses scans of the target stars with scans of other regions of sky. Data DescriptionData is stored in a numpy float16 format in training folder and the labes are mentioned in the train_labels. If you found this notebook useful and use parts of it in your work please don t forget to show your appreciation by upvoting this kernel. com ihelon signal search exploratory data analysis Inspired from https www. csv file where the first letter of the file name indicates the subfolder the. That keeps me motivated and inspires me to write and share these public kernels. Final Save ModelThis is a simple starter kernel on implementation of Transfer Learning using Pytorch for this problem. Pytorch has many SOTA Image models which you can try out using the guidelines in this notebook. Label Smoothing CNN Model Training and Validation PredictionLoading the best model from training step.
