Models based an architecture such as sequence2sequence for example to translate from one language to another Attention use to clarify the word order when translating by the decoder more specificaly to make weights of some words more or less meaningful in the encoder path for improved translation. io resources lectures seq2seq attention score_functions min. The general computation scheme is shown below. html At each decoder step attention receives attention input a decoder state ht and all encoder states s1 s2. The most popular ways to compute attention scores are dot product the simplest method bilinear function aka Luong attention used in the paper Effective Approaches to Attention based Neural Machine Translation multi layer perceptron aka Bahdanau attention the method proposed in the original paper. shape num_features num_channels. Excerpt from article https lena voita. sk computes attention scores For each encoder state sk attention computes its relevance for this decoder state ht. com mandrakedrink ECG Synthesis and Classification to generate new synthetic data for classes with little data now the dataset looks like this Dataset and DataLoader Models https 64. png We will use Attention mechanism in ecg classification to clarify to give more attention to important features be it features from recurrent layers or convolutional. Formally it applies an attention function which receives one decoder state and one encoder state and returns a scalar value score ht sk computes attention weights a probability distribution softmax applied to attention scores computes attention output the weighted sum of encoder states with attention weights. alt https lena voita. png Attention Mechanism Quick ReminderThe attention mechanism is best explained with the example of the seq2seq model so it would be a great idea to read this interactive article https lena voita.
