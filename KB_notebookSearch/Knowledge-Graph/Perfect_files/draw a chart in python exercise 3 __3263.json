HistogramWhat is a chart bar Bar charts are one of the main methods of graphical representation in statistics. And can be used to display density information about the dataset. Unlike regular bar charts the bars are placed to touch each other. Class or middle marks below the bars can also be used. These values are used to display specific amounts of qualitative data on a horizontal axis and relative frequencies or frequency or percentage on a vertical axis. To group a value distinct observation values are used to label the bars each of which is located below its own bar. If the axis distance is X 1 the histogram is equal to the relative frequency diagram. Rectangular Histogram A visual representation of data using bars of different heights. In a histogram the variable is a small variable and can be continuous or discrete. In this case the area of the bar indicates the frequency of the variable. These types of charts are similar to bar charts but a rectangular chart divides numbers into different categories from which you can decide which category to choose. In a histogram quantitative data classes are displayed on the horizontal axis and the frequency or relative frequency or percentage of the classes is displayed on the y axis. The vertical bar usually shows the frequency or relative frequency or percentage of the class which is equal to its height. But it is also possible to change the axes. For finite grouping or shear point grouping the lower class range or equivalently the lower class shear points is used to label the bars. In this case the distances used on the x axis may be different and on the y axis the frequency density is specified. What is the difference between a Bar Graph and a Histogram Most importantly a histology is an evolution of the bar chart but not the same as a bar chart. A histogram is a type of bar chart but bar charts are definitely not histological charts. Bar charts are used to compare variables while display charts are used to show the distribution of variables. We want to draw bar and circle diagrams for 100 people with different blood groups A Bar plot B pie chart 2 scatter plot 3 histogram Graph vs. Histogram is used to show variable density at intervals. The variable on the X axis can be a single group or a grouping. What is a histogram The histogram is another important graphical representation of the data and can be considered as an improvement from the bar chart. Bar charts are used to plot batch or qualitative data while histograms are used to plot quantitative data with a range of data grouped into buckets or intervals. The bar chart with the above configuration is the most common and is known as a vertical bar chart or a bar chart. In this case the bars are horizontal. A bar with its height length corresponding to the relative frequency shows any specific value and the bars are positioned so that they do not touch each other. Bar charts are spaced between two strips while histology has no spacing between bars. This is because the x axis is discrete in batch bar graphs whereas in histograms they are discrete or slightly continuous.
