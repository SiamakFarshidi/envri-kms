However adding week in year improves LightGBM performance week in year and month in year could perhaps be better modelled together as day in year. SARIMA seasonal auto regressive integrated moving average allows modelling a single seasonality only but one can encode the other seasonalities using Fourier terms as exogenous variables and employ SARIMAX see the TBATS link above for a comparison of the two methods. I have found that trying to do all the computation including the other exogenous variables that we have in one SARIMAX takes far too long 72 hours for all 30490 series on dual threaded quad core 2. The mean is then forecast by an ARMA 3 2 model using SARIMAX and the seasonality is forecast by simple repetition.

This approach was taken by the winner of the M4 competition as a precursor step to modelling and forecasting with a neural network see here https www. html The idea is to use seasonal_decompose to get the mean which may be fluctuating and seasonality which is periodic of the training data.

Note that ARMA https en. 7 using only state space models http www. The downside of this is that we forecast a constant mean for the test period whereas it may be trending. State Space Modelling for M5 Forecasting AccuracyThis notebook was inspired by this discussion post Any time series model 0. There are various notebooks that have used LightGBM with categorical variables to model seasonality and trend in sales e. I believe convergence is more important. com kaggle docker python For example here s several helpful packages to load linear algebra data processing CSV file I O e. org wiki Autoregressive E2 80 93moving average_model SARMA and ARMAX are all special cases of SARIMAX and the same function is used to estimate all of them. SARMA adds a single S easonality term ARMAX adds e X ogenous variables in our case dummies for event_name_1 and the binary SNAP features. Interestingly all these notebooks treat the resultant labels as numeric rather than categorical in LightGBM but that is a matter for another day. That work was done in R Python s Holt Winters only allows a single seasonality. Hopefully the subsequent steps will compensate for this. This is quite slow and gives poor dynamic forecasts if we enforce a day in year seasonality period 365 so we down sample to 28 day blocks and make a one step ahead forecast to cover the whole test period. com ragnar123 very fst model m5 baseline https www. There are several ways to deal with multiple seasonality in time series forecasting whether we are using state space models or neural networks each with their drawbacks Exponential smoothing with multiple seasonalities incorporated directly i. My own investigation suggests there are at least three seasonalities within the sales data month in year day in month and day of week. Using zeros as starting parameters.
