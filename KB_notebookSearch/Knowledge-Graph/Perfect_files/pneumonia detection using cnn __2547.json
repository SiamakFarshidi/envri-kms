Reading and resizing the image using opencv Load the dataset Data Visualization PreprocessingThe data seems imbalanced. Approaches that alter the training data in ways that change the array representation while keeping the label the same are known as data augmentation techniques. Data AugmentationIn order to avoid overfitting problem we need to expand artificially our dataset. input directory For example running this by clicking run or pressing Shift Enter will list all files under the input directory You can write up to 5GB to the current directory kaggle working that gets preserved as output when you create a version using Save Run All You can also write temporary files to kaggle temp but they won t be saved outside of the current session Reshaping images to preferred size Normalize the data resize data for deep learning With data augmentation to prevent overfitting and handling the imbalance in dataset set input mean to 0 over the dataset set each sample mean to 0 divide inputs by std of the dataset divide each input by its std apply ZCA whitening randomly rotate images in the range degrees 0 to 180 Randomly zoom image randomly shift images horizontally fraction of total width randomly shift images vertically fraction of total height randomly flip images randomly flip images. For the data augmentation i choosed to Randomly rotate some training images by 30 degreesRandomly Zoom by 20 some training imagesRandomly shift images horizontally by 10 of the widthRandomly shift images vertically by 10 of the heightRandomly flip images horizontally. Some popular augmentations people use are grayscales horizontal flips vertical flips random crops color jitters translations rotations and much more. By applying just a couple of these transformations to our training data we can easily double or triple the number of training examples and create a very robust model. For the analysis of chest x ray images all chest radiographs were initially screened for quality control by removing all low quality or unreadable scans. Training the Model Analysis after Model TrainingSome of the Correctly Predicted Classes This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed It is defined by the kaggle python Docker image https github. The diagnoses for the images were then graded by two expert physicians before being cleared for training the AI system. read_csv Input data files are available in the read only. All chest X ray imaging was performed as part of patients routine clinical care. There are 5 863 X Ray images JPEG and 2 categories Pneumonia Normal. com kaggle docker python For example here s several helpful packages to load linear algebra data processing CSV file I O e. In order to account for any grading errors the evaluation set was also checked by a third expert. The idea is to alter the training data with small transformations to reproduce the variations. com paultimothymooney chest xray pneumoniaImporting all the required libraries Description of the Pneumonia DatasetThe dataset is organized into 3 folders train test val and contains subfolders for each image category Pneumonia Normal. Moreover the CNN converges faster on 0. of training examples we will use data augmentation Previewing the images of both the classesWe perform a grayscale normalization to reduce the effect of illumination s differences. Once our model is ready we fit the training dataset. Dataset https www. We can make your existing dataset even larger.
