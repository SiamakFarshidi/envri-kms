Model Fitting Logistic Regression Naive Bayes SVM K Nearest Neighbors Decision Tree Random Forest XGBoost Neural Network VI. Predicting presence of Heart Disease using Machine Learning I. the ones with typical angina are much less likely to have heart problems Analysing the FBS feature Nothing extraordinary here Analysing the restecg feature We realize that people with restecg 1 and 0 are much more likely to have a heart disease than with restecg 2 Analysing the exang feature People with exang 1 i. Importing essential libraries II. Cheers This shows that most columns are moderately correlated with target but fbs is very weakly correlated. count 100 303 print Percentage of patience with heart problems str y. Exercise induced angina are much less likely to have heart problems Analysing the Slope feature We observe that Slope 2 causes heart pain much more than Slope 0 and 1 Analysing the ca feature ca 4 has astonishingly large number of heart patients IV. 08 using Random Forest I m a beginner to Kaggle and am learning to practice Machine Learning code. Output final score We observe that we can achieve the best accuracy of 95. target 0 countHaveDisease len df df. print Percentage of patience with heart problems str y. If there s anything I ve done wrong or anything new or better that I can add to my code I d really appreciate valuable feedback on it. I hope this Kernel can help out a few others like myself who are looking for a beginner friendly kernel for getting better at Machine Learning I d love some feedback. Train Test split V. Importing and understanding our dataset Verifying it as a dataframe object in pandas Shape of dataset Printing out a few columns Description Let s understand our columns better Analysing the target variable Clearly this is a classification problem with the target variable having values 0 and 1 Checking correlation between columns Exploratory Data Analysis EDA First analysing the target variable We ll analyse sex cp fbs restecg exang slope ca and thal features Analysing the Sex feature We notice that as expected the sex feature has 2 unique features We notice that females are more likely to have heart problems than males Analysing the Chest Pain Type feature As expected the CP feature has values from 0 to 3 We notice that chest pain of 0 i.
