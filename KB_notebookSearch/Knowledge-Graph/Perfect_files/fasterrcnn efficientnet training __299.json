Introductin Reference kernel https www. out_channels 1280 FasterRCNN needs to know the number of output channels in a backbone. For EfficientNetB0 it s 1280 so we need to add it here backbone. out_channels 1280 print backbone let s make the RPN generate 5 x 3 anchors per spatial location with 5 different sizes and 3 different aspect ratios. put everything together print model as there is only one class no crowd instances define the training tranforms define the validation transforms print box the image is in RGB convert to BGR for cv2 annotations print model update the learning rate if itr 50 0 print f Validation iteration itr loss loss_value update the learning rate if lr_scheduler is not None lr_scheduler. More generally the backbone should return an OrderedDict Tensor and in featmap_names you can choose which feature maps to use. if your backbone returns a Tensor featmap_names is expected to be 0. numpy new_model model. register_forward_hook hook_feature print new_model backbone EfficientNet. from_pretrained efficientnet b0 print backbone conv_head.
