Geospatial dataGeographic data is not so often found in problems but it is still useful to master the basic techniques for working with it especially since there are quite a number of ready to use solutions in this field. Besides it is not always the fastest to receive information via HTTP. TextsText is a type of data that can come in different formats there are so many text processing methods that cannot fit in a single article. gif It is worth noting that this model does not comprehend the meaning of the words but simply tries to position the vectors such that words used in common context are close to each other. edu IR book html htmledition stemming and lemmatization 1. the height above sea level. It is possible to iterate until we hit a maximum number of characteristics or until the quality of the model ceases to increase significantly. Such models need to be trained on very large datasets in order for the vector coordinates to capture the semantics. Approaches to handling missing values are pretty straightforward encode missing values with a separate blank value like n a for categorical variables use the most probable value of the feature mean or median for the numerical variables the most common value for categorical variables or conversely encode with some extreme value good for decision tree models since it allows the model to make a partition between the missing and non missing values for ordered data e. In that case distances great circle distance and road distance calculated by the routing graph number of turns with the ratio of left to right turns number of traffic lights junctions and bridges will be useful. In this task you need to predict the popularity of a new rental listing i. In a time when GPUs were weaker and the renaissance of neural networks had not happened yet feature generation from images was its own complex field. In practice you need to consider stop words the maximum length of the dictionary more efficient data structures usually text data is converted to a sparse vector etc. org webt r7 sq my r7sqmyj1nmqmzltaftt40zi7 gw.

However if the algorithm involves the calculation of distances between points or vectors the default choice is StandardScaling. The process described looks simpler in code Here is an illustration of the process This is an extremely naive implementation. fillna http pandas. You can probably think of a few other fresh ideas the concept is universal enough. This algorithm is called Sequential Feature Selection http rasbt. Not everyone can or want to tinker with transformations and these algorithms are robust to unusual distributions. com c catch me if you can intruder detection through webpage session tracking bag of apps https www. This is an exception rather than a rule often it s driven by the desire to adapt the dataset to the requirements of the algorithm. For example cash withdrawals can be linked to a pay day the purchase of a metro card to the beginning of the month. org licenses by nc sa 4. This is a classic example of operations that can be performed on vectorized concepts king man woman queen. In one of my own tasks I generated a feature called the complexity of the road which computed the graph calculated distance divided by the GCD. Feature transformations Feature transformations Normalization and changing distribution Normalization and changing distribution Interactions Interactions Filling in the missing values Filling in the missing values 3. large X_ norm frac X X_ min X_ max X_ min StandardScaling and MinMax Scaling have similar applications and are often more or less interchangeable. io What a cute raccoon In real life you may need to pay more attention to resizing Need an extra dimension because model is designed to work with an array of images i. org wiki Log normal_distribution it can easily be transformed to a normal distribution The lognormal distribution is suitable for describing salaries price of securities urban population number of comments on articles on the internet etc. If you have a lot of data you will quickly reach the limits of external API. For a normal distribution it will look like a smooth diagonal line and visual anomalies should be intuitively understandable. time series take the adjacent value next or previous. There also exist some more esoteric approaches to such data like projecting the time onto a circle and using the two coordinates. png Using these algorithms it is possible to obtain a working solution for a simple problem which can serve as a baseline. com madmaze pytesseract.

Time series web etc. Two types of models are usually used some wooden composition such as Random Forest https medium. Most simply tokens are just the words. If there are a limited number of features it is possible to generate all the possible interactions and then weed out the unnecessary ones using the techniques described in the next section. One had to work at a low level determining corners borders of regions color distributions statistics and so on. An unexpected application is food2vec https jaan. There is no silver bullet here. In this case why not introduce a feature called lag behind the latest version of the browser In addition to the operating system and browser you can look at the referrer not always available http_accept_language https developer. You need to understand that there is a variety of proxy and outdated databases so this feature can contain noise. io mlxtend user_guide feature_selection SequentialFeatureSelector. This algorithm can be reversed start with the complete feature space and remove features one by one until it does not impair the quality of the model or until the desired number of features is reached. com open machine learning course open machine learning course topic 4 linear classification and regression 44a41b9b5220. html univariate feature selection. Sometimes it can be enough to read the csv file and convert it into numpy. Things are getting better Let s see whether transformations can somehow help the real model. WiFi location tracking is based on the combination of SSID and MAC addresses which may correspond to different points e. io food2vec augmented cooking machine intelligence. Adding onto the Bag of Words idea words that are rarely found in the corpus in all the documents of this dataset but are present in this particular document might be more important. Train a model on a subset of features store results repeat for different subsets and compare the quality of models to identify the best feature set. Instead download a pretrained state of the art network with the weights from public sources. At the time of this writing Chromium 56 was new but after some time only users who haven t rebooted their browser for a long time will have this version. Feature selection Feature selection Statistical approaches Statistical approaches Selection by modeling Selection by modeling Grid search Grid search 1. Network administration gurus may try to extract even fancier features like suggestions for using VPN https habrahabr. com download 58540a46e3b9659c9f000372 etc. Then it makes sense to increase the weight of more domain specific words to separate them out from common words.

Geospatial data is often presented in the form of addresses or coordinates of Latitude Longitude. After tokenization you will normalize the data. png Here s a classifier trained on one dataset and adapted for a different one by detaching the last layer and adding a new one instead. But to some extent it protects against outliers Another fairly popular option is MinMax Scaling which brings all the points within a predetermined interval typically 0 1. image https habrastorage. If you have a small amount of data enough time and no desire to extract fancy features you can use reverse_geocoder in lieu of OpenStreetMap When working with geo\u0441oding we must not forget that addresses may contain typos which makes the data cleaning step necessary. The next useful piece of information is the IP address from which you can extract the country and possibly the city provider and connection type mobile stationary. If we assume that some data is not normally distributed but is described by the log normal distribution https en. In general when working with time series data it is a good idea to have a calendar with public holidays abnormal weather conditions and other important events. It is easier because it is possible to just use one of the popular pretrained networks without much thinking but harder because if you need to dig into the details you may end up going really deep. Often for problems associated with images a convolutional neural network is used. The well known concept of garbage in garbage out applies 100 to any task in machine learning. html and SimpleCV http simplecv. image https cdn images 1. In addition not all interactions between features must have a physical meaning for example polynomial features see sklearn. Searching all combinations usually takes too long so you can try to reduce the search space. Take a look how this approach was done in one simple yet elegant Kaggle kernel https www. There are also purely engineering reasons np. tensor shaped batch_size width height n_channels Value of the statistic p value With such p value we d have to reject the null hypothesis of normality of the data Let s draw plots Let s take the price feature from Renthop dataset and filter by hands the most extreme values for clarity A lot of gestures so that sklearn didn t shower us with warnings Avoid division by zero. In the examples above we have worked with synthetic data and strictly tested normality using the Shapiro Wilk test. The second reason is that some algorithms take noise non informative features as a signal and overfit. Imputer http scikit learn. In some cases it is possible to generate N grams of characters. classify the listing into three classes low medium high. If this is not taken into account a lot of fun examples will come up. However to apply this procedure the underlying distribution does not necessarily have to be lognormal you can try to apply this transformation to any distribution with a heavy right tail. org doc scipy reference generated scipy. One can read about the difference between them here http nlp. Selection by modelingAnother approach is to use some baseline model for feature evaluation because the model will clearly show the importance of the features. ImagesWorking with images is easier and harder at the same time. Regarding time series we will not go into too much detail here mostly due to my personal lack of experience but I will point you to a useful library that automatically generates features for time series https github. io en latest SimpleCV. org stable modules preprocessing. Translated and edited by Christina Butsko https www. when one distribution is located in the vicinity of zero and does not go beyond 1 1 while the other s range is on the order of hundreds of thousands. Feature transformations Normalization and changing distributionMonotonic feature transformation is critical for some algorithms and has no effect on others. This approach is called Exhaustive Feature Selection http rasbt. Any experienced professional can recall numerous times when a simple model trained on high quality data was proven to be better than a complicated multi model ensemble built on data that wasn t clean. Different geocoders have their own characteristics and the quality varies from region to region. Therefore it is necessary to consider using a local version of OpenStreetMap. Therefore I invite everyone to share their experiences and discuss feature extraction and generation in the comments section. Let s try to look at some real data and test for normality using a less formal method Q Q plot https en. However the difference between such coding methods is down to the third decimal place in the metric. The number of rooms rarely exceeds 5 whereas the distance from city center can easily be in the thousands of meters. org wiki Q E2 80 93Q_plot. You should limit yourself in this process. Features generated by hand are still very useful for example for predicting the popularity of a rental listing we can assume that bright apartments attract more attention and create a feature such as the average value of the pixel. Logic suggests that the cost per single room is more indicative than the total cost so we can generate such a feature. Both key python libraries for data analysis provide easy to use solutions pandas. At the same time if you encode them as categorical variables you ll breed a large numbers of features and lose information about proximity the difference between 22 and 23 will be the same as the difference between 22 and 7. Parametric methods usually require a minimum of symmetric and unimodal distribution of data which is not always given in real data. com arsenyinfo easy feature selection pipeline 0 55 at lb. Easy to use library solutions sometimes suggest sticking to something like df df. The first is clear to every engineer the more data the higher the computational complexity. If your task is to just vectorize the image for example to use some non network classifier you only need to remove the last layers and use the output from the previous layers image https cdn images 1. Those who do not have a Kaggle account will have to register you will also need to accept the rules of the competition in order to download the data. Similar methods are applied in other areas such as bioinformatics. is not as simple as it seems. Fix a small number N iterate through all combinations of N features choose the best combination and then iterate through the combinations of N 1 features so that the previous best combination of features is fixed and only a single new feature is considered. Here you can really unleash your imagination and invent features based on your life experience and domain knowledge the proximity of a point to the subway the number of stories in the building the distance to the nearest store the number of ATMs around etc. For some problems this can be critical. One must understand that pytesseract is not a solution for everything. Using Word2Vec and similar models we can not only vectorize words in a high dimensional space typically a few hundred dimensions but also compare their semantic similarity. To start I wanted to review three similar but different tasks feature extraction and feature engineering transformation of raw data into features suitable for modeling feature transformation transformation of data to improve the accuracy of the algorithm feature selection removing unnecessary features. For example check out pytesseract https github. Third look at the browser. By the way the data from the IP address is well combined with http_accept_language if the user is sitting at the Chilean proxies and browser locale is ru_RU something is unclean and worth a look in the corresponding column in the table is_traveler_or_proxy_user. Nevertheless we should not focus too much on neural network techniques. The default option is as follows large idf t D log frac mid D mid df d t 1 large tfidf t d D tf t d times idf t D Analogs of Bag of Words can be found outside of text problems e. com open id 1_lqydkMrmyNAgG4vU4wVmp6 j7tV0XI8 is it s copy. x reference ImageStat. If the data source is a mobile device the geolocation may not be determined by GPS but by WiFi networks in the area which leads to holes in space and teleportation. Furthermore one can try to use other similar transformations formulating their own hypotheses on how to approximate the available distribution to a normal. html are often used in linear models and are almost impossible to interpret. You do not have to come up with the architecture and train a network from scratch. com open machine learning course open machine learning course topic 5 ensembles of algorithms and random forest 8e05246cbba7 or a linear model with Lasso regularization so that it is prone to nullify weights of weak features. ai Open Machine Learning Course Author Arseny Kravchenko http arseny. Among the features in this problem are the number of rooms and the price. A simple example suppose that the task is to predict the cost of an apartment from two variables the distance from city center and the number of rooms. We must not forget that this is not a silver bullet again it can make the performance worse. com in evgenysushko and Yuanyuan Pao https www. If we build on this thought it is reasonable to say that features with low variance are worse than those with high variance. To avoid this problem we can revisit our tokenization step and use N grams the sequence of N consecutive tokens instead. These solutions do not have any magic happening behind the scenes. In addition you can also try adding a constant to the feature np. Feature selectionWhy would it even be necessary to select features To some this idea may seem counterintuitive but there are at least two important reasons to get rid of unimportant features. Feature Engineering and Feature SelectionIn this course we have already seen several key machine learning algorithms. Fortunately there are universal libraries like geopy https github. There are other ways that are also based on classical statistics http scikit learn. org en US docs Web HTTP Headers Accept Language and other meta information. federal provider standardizes the firmware of routers up to MAC address and places them in different cities. Experienced specialists in computer vision could draw a lot of parallels between older approaches and neural networks in particular convolutional layers in today s networks are similar to Haar cascades https en. The simplest transformation is Standard Scaling or Z score normalization large z frac x mu sigma Note that Standard Scaling does not make the distribution normal in the strict sense. There are ready to use tokenizers that take into account peculiarities of the language but they make mistakes as well especially when you work with specific sources of text newspapers slang misspellings typos. The logic is intuitive if features are clearly useless in a simple model there is no need to drag them to a more complex one. So one can consider cutting features with variance below a certain threshold. Any given area has so many specifics that it is too much for an individual to absorb completely. However data requirements are imposed not only by parametric methods K nearest neighbors https medium. png Q Q plot for lognormal distribution image https habrastorage. Before working with text one must tokenize it. com geopy geopy that act as wrappers for these external services. com open machine learning course open machine learning course topic 3 classification decision trees and k nearest neighbors 8613c6b6d2cd will predict complete nonsense if features are not normalized e. Let s come back again to the Two Sigma Connect Rental Listing Inquiries problem. For any task you can easily come up with dozens of features and extract them from various external sources. As in other domains you can come up with your own features based on intuition about the nature of the data. If two or more points are interconnected it may be worthwhile to extract features from the route between them. 5 is chosen more or less arbitrarily Synthetic example Install mlxtend. Data scientists often do so called fine tuning to adapt these networks to their needs by detaching the last fully connected layers of the network adding new layers chosen for a specific task and then training the network on new data. It is a wealth of information. Some tasks may require additional calendar features. For problems outside an urban environment you may consider features from more specific sources e. For text this is about stemming and or lemmatization these are similar processes used to process different forms of a word.

If you are working with web data then you usually have information about the user s User Agent. This approach would be able to account for similarity of related words or handle typos. Date and timeYou would think that date and time are standardized because of their prevalence but nevertheless some pitfalls remain. Q What do Chinese New Year the New York marathon and the Trump inauguration have in common A They all need to be put on the calendar of potential anomalies. If there is text on the image you can read it without unraveling a complicated neural network. Statistical approachesThe most obvious candidate for removal is a feature whose value remains unchanged i. Feature Extraction Texts Texts Images Images Geospatial data Geospatial data Date and time Date and time Time series web etc. Some examples will use the dataset from Renthop company which is used in the Two Sigma Connect Rental Listing Inquiries Kaggle competition https www. Let s look at some of the popular types of data from which features can be extracted. So now that we have turned the document into a sequence of words we can represent it with vectors. A pretrained model for your own tasks can be downloaded here https github. Word2Vec is a special case of the word embedding algorithms. Grid searchFinally we get to the most reliable method which is also the most computationally complex trivial grid search. Examples of such transformations are Box Cox transformation https docs. org webt on bk qg onbkqg1j1tdcj9kc4txfjv6soco. html logarithm is a special case of the Box Cox transformation or Yeo Johnson transformation https gist. com c two sigma connect rental listing inquiries just in case the dataset is no longer available on Kaggle here https drive. The easiest approach is called Bag of Words we create a vector with the length of the dictionary compute the number of occurrences of each word in the text and place that number of occurrences in the appropriate position in the vector. com max 800 1 K5X4N MJKt8FGFtrTHwidg. As long as we work with toy datasets the size of the data is not a problem but for real loaded production systems hundreds of extra features will be quite tangible. This approach is called TF IDF term frequency inverse document frequency which cannot be written in a few lines so you should look into the details in references such as this wiki https en. But this is not the best solution data preparation takes more time than building models so thoughtless gap filling may hide a bug in processing and damage the model. com max 800 1 Iw_cKFwLkTVO2SPrOZU2rQ. If you use the hour as a real variable we slightly contradict the nature of data 0 01. Coordinates contain fewer misprints but its position can be incorrect due to GPS noise or bad accuracy in places like tunnels downtown areas etc. In addition we will also create a separate binary feature for the weekend called is_weekend. The point is usually located among infrastructure. Tokenization implies splitting the text into units hence tokens. Depending on the task you may need two mutually inverse operations geocoding recovering a point from an address and reverse geocoding recovering an address from a point. If you are interested in reading more here are a couple of links to some interesting libraries skimage http scikit image. Of course this example is purely artificial however it is worth using for real problems. That s why every task begins with feature extraction. Both operations are accessible in practice via external APIs from Google Maps or OpenStreetMap. Filling in the missing valuesNot many algorithms can work with missing values and the real world often provides data with gaps. There may be more stringent requirements recall our earlier article about linear models https medium. We can see that our selected features have improved the quality of the classifier. Let s load the dataset from Renthop right away Install Keras https keras. This is one of the reasons for the increased popularity of decision trees and all its derivative algorithms random forest gradient boosting.
