As we are not looking at the whole tissue we are not loosing spatial connections between patches and it s not important that some neighboring patches are rotated in different directions. 4294 rep rep1 type pdf of professor Anant Madabhushi https case. We have to check this again after setting up a validation strategy and find a strategy to deal with class weights if we like to apply them. Nonetheless it s a very good exercise to practice or develop own deep learning and data science skills. This seems arbitrary and we should rethink this strategy in the next cycle of our datascience workflow. This way each batch is composed differently and we don t start to learn for specific sequences of images. This way one would be able to overcome the dependence on the pathologist which would be especially useful in regions where no experts are available. Visualising the breast tissue This part is a bit tricky We have to extract all coordinates of image patches that are stored in the image names. org wiki File Lobules_and_ducts_of_the_breast. It s malicious and able to form metastases which makes it especially dangerous. The number of image patches per patient varies a lot This leads to the questions whether all images show the same resolution of tissue cells of if this varies between patients. If we would like to include some target information we would need to create a feature that allows us to generate some balance. Exploratory analysis What do we know about our data Insights1. Exploratory analysis eda What do we know about our data data Looking at healthy and invasive ductal carcinoma patches patches Visualising the breast tissue tissue 4. 1714 You can see that the f1 score 0. Storing the image_path patient_id and the targetOk now for each patient we know the path for each patch as well as if it contains IDC or not the target. This way we can load batches of images only one by one without storing the pixel values of all images. We should keep this in mind Creating pytorch image datasets It s often a good idea to start as simple as possible and to grow more complex while iterating through the solution. Invasive carcinoma is able to leave its initial tissue compartment and can form metastases. That s a small number compared to the expected number of patients one would like to analyse with our algorithm after deployment. It seems that tissue patches have been discarded or lost during preparation. But as one can see it s not always the case. Creating pytorch dataloaders As the gradients for each learning step are computed over batches we benefit from shuffling the training data after each epoch. Using it we could only use one single output neuron to make predictions. Performing the training or loading results Exploring results and errors Loss convergence The probability landscape of invasive ductal carcinoma Going into details TODO Number of correct classifications per patient compared to cancer tissue size. To feed the algorithm with image patches it would be nice to store the path of each image. As I like to compute the f1 score during training and prediction and I need to compute false and true positives negatives in a simple manner I will use the cross entropy loss with K 2 output neurons or 2 classes that can be hot 1 or cold 0 with sum_ k y_ nk 1 L sum_ n 1 N sum_ k 1 K 2 w_ k cdot t_ n k cdot ln y_ nk The w_ k are used to weight the positive and negative classes such that we are able to deal with the class imbalance. You can see that class 1 positive cancer has a higher weight. Insights The loss drops right from the start but increases after values higher than 0. Conclusion linear algebra data processing CSV file I O e. Binary target visualisation per tissue slice Before we will take a look at the whole tissue let s keep it a bit simpler by looking at the target structure in the x y space for a handful of patients Insights Sometimes we don t have the full tissue information. read_csv zero the parameter gradients forward track history if only in train backward optimize only if in training phase for param in model. What is meant by invasive ductal carcinoma intro 2. This matches the total number of patches. 3 possibilities healthy tissue IDC another subtype of breast cancer business case prediction so far is done manually by pathologists and varies from expert to expert. The classes of IDC versus no IDC are imbalanced. jpg shows the anatomy of a healthy breast. Imagine our model would predict no cancer for all patches. A rate that is too high will lead to jumps to higher values in the training loss during optimization. Patches with cancer look more violet and crowded than healthy ones. Then we would have the maximum number of true positives but also a very high number of false positives that decreases the recall to some baseline value. How many patients do we have Almost 280 patients. Consequently overfitting to this specific patient distribution is very likely and we need to take care about the generalization performance of our model. parameters cyclical lr schedule is invoked after each batch statistics deep copy the model load best model weights max_iterations should be the number of steps within num_epochs_ epoch_iterations this way the learning rate increases linearily within the period num_epochs epoch_iterations suggested_stepsize 2 num_iterations_within_epoch.

A better idea could be to cluster patients with dependence on the size of the tumor the number of total patches and statistical quantities of area coverd by the patches. The reason behind that is that we would like to have test patients that cover a broad range of possible variations. Many years have passed by since then and it s very likely that all methods used in the paper have already been changed improved and that new research has already been done. Even then we still obtain a accuracy score higher than 0. To deal with this imbalance we like to increase the impact of the gradients of positive cases during training and we can do so with a higher weight than for the negative cases. But in our case we were able to load them all Setting up the machine learning workflow Settings Validation strategy Let s start very simple by selecting 30 of the patients as test data and the remaining 70 for training and developing. Often a biopsy is done to remove small tissue samples. Precision and recallTo fully understand the f1 score we first need to grasp precision and recall. Comparing both images it seems that darker more violet colored tissue has a higher chance to be cancer than those with rose color. Reading the paper link that seems to be related to this data this could also be part of the preprocessing. In the paper tissue slices of 162 patients were used all having IDC 113 used for training and 49 for validation One pathologist was used to determine regions of IDC given a tissue slice evaluation metric F1 score and balanced accuracy Our goal Given a patient and a patch of a tissue slice predict wheather it contains IDC or not. Given the coordinates of image patches we could try to reconstruct the whole tissue image not only the targets. For each patient we have an individual subfolder that contains image patches. Let s take a look at the augmentations For validation we have only used the image resizing. Let s use an example patient with id 13616 Insights The tissue on the left is shown without target information. Hence if either the recall or the precision is small the f1 score will then tend towards the smaller value. Is this really typical for cancer or is it more typical for ductal cells and tissue Though some of the healthy patches are very violet colored too Would be very interesting to hear what criteria are important for a pathologist. Now it s 70 train and 15 for dev and test. Confusion matrix Exploring very bad results. How many of them do we have in total Ok roughly 280000 images. Methods presented in the paperCollecting information. Consequently not the whole patient tissue slice but the single patches have to be considered as input to our algorithm. Then we can use the coordinates to reconstruct the whole breast tissue of a patient. Consequently we can set the minimum learning rate to 1e 6 and the maximum to 0. Selecting an evaluation metric The percentage of correct predictions accuracy score is not a good evaluation metric for imbalanced target distributions. Exploring results and errors error_analysis Loss convergence losses The probability landscape of invasive ductal carcinoma landscape Going into details details 7. Defining the model structure Our dataset is very small and we should be afraid of overfitting to our patients. Therefor deep learning could be of great help to automatically detect and locate tumor tissue cells and to speed up the process. Let s pick an example with recall 0. Conclusion conclusion What is meant by invasive ductal carcinoma This illustration created Mikael H\u00e4ggstr\u00f6m https commons. 1714 is then shifted towards the smaller value of the recall and not close to the arithmetic mean of mu 0. edu medicine ccir faculty anant madabhushi and his group. Does a tissue slice per patient cover the whole region of interest 3. In our case we have much more negative healthy patches than those with cancer. For validation and training we drop the last batch that often consists less images than the batch size. Ductal carcinoma starts to develop in the ducts whereas lobular carcinoma has its origin in the lobules. So far we can t stratify on the targets as we are splitting on patient ids. Predicting invasive ductal carcinoma in tissue slices MotivationInasive ductal carcinoma IDC is with 80 of cases one of the most common types of breast cancer. Our goalAs we started with this analysis we asked ourselves if we would be able to improve the results that were presented 2014 in the paper Automatic detection of invasive ductal carcinoma in whole slide images with Convolutional Neural Networks http citeseerx. For this reason it can be a good idea to use transfer learning with a pretrained CNN. As CNNs are translational but not rotational invariant it s a good idea to add flips during training. This way we benefit from the fact that the first layers of a pretrained CNN extract basic features like edges for example and only last layers contain very problem specific features. In addition sick cells need to be located to find out how advanced the disease is and which grade should be assigned. How many patches do we have in total Our algorithm needs to decide whether an image patch contains IDC or not. I always have to look it up recall frac TruePositives TruePositives FalsePositives Imagine our model would predict cancer all the time. Ok now we have the coordinates for each patch its path to load the image and its target information. This way we prevent to build up models that are likely overfitted to the available data and we can find out useful ideas in a strategic manner instead of trying out every idea at random. I assume that the wholes in the tissue belong to the mammary ducts where the milk can flow through. In contrast if our model would always predict no cancer we would have no true positives and our recall equals zero. Furthermore the decision depends on the expertise of the pathologist and his or her equipment. Visualising the breast tissue images Ok now it s time to go one step deeper with our EDA. The goal is to assist with an automatic detection of tumors not expert dependent. Some patients have more than 80 patches that show IDC Consequently the tissue is full of cancer or only a part of the breast was covered by the tissue slice that is focused on the IDC cancer. Then a pathologist has to decide whether a patient has IDC another type of breast cancer or is healthy. This has to be done manually and is a time consuming process. The f1 scoreA better choice is the f1 score that is defined as the harmonic mean of precision and recall f_ 1 frac 2 frac 1 recall frac 1 precision In contrast to the arithmetic mean it is shifted towards small outiers but not influenced strongly by large ones. A common loss for this problem is the binary cross entropy function. Preparation peek at the data structure prep Loading packages and settings setup Exploring the data structure explorestructure 3. One can see the lobules the glands that can produce milk which flews through the milk ducts. This way we increase the variety of our data in a meaningful way as each patch could be rotated as well on the tissue slice. In order to exploit the full potential one could build a pipeline using massive amounts of tissue image data of various hospitals that were evaluated by different experts. For this reason one can say that the recall answers How many selected cases are positive precision frac TruePositives TruePositives FalseNegatives How many positive cases are selected Building the training loop Searching for an optimal cyclical learning rate The learning rate is one of the most important hyperparameters for tuning neural networks. Looking at healthy and cancer patches Cancer patches Healthy patches Insights Sometimes we can find artifacts or incomplete patches that have smaller size than 50x50 pixels. Furthermore we need to create a dataset that loads an image patch of a patient converts it to RGB performs the augmentation if it s desired and returns the image the target the patient id and the image coordinates. Table of contents1. Our model might start to learn that mammary ducts are always related to cancer Sometimes it s not possible to load an image patch as the path is ill defined. Only then we can measure something like a generalisation performance. If it s too small the learning process is too slow and will probably stop too early in the case we have defined a minimum required loss change. Take a look at the paper Cyclical Learning Rates for Training Neural Networks https arxiv. edu viewdoc download doi 10. To simplify this task let s write a method that takes a patient and outcomes a dataframe with coordinates and targets. Target distributions Let s take a look at the target distribution difference of the datasets We can see that the test data has more cancer patches compared to healthy tissue patches than train or dev. The simplest transformations we can do for each image are resizing the images to the desired input shape performing horizontal and vertical flipsIn our case the patches are of shape 50x50x3 and we could set this as our input shape. Again our policy is to start simple by using a small network like resnet18 Setting up the loss function The task to predict the presence of inasive ductal carcinoma given a tissue patch is a binary classification. The image on the right shows the same tissue but cancer is stained with intensive red color. 6 f_ 1 frac 2 frac 1 0. Preparation peek at the data structure Loading packages and setting Settings Exploring the data structure Ok in this folder we should find several images or a further substructure of folders. If this is true we have to be careful. These are patient ids. 5 and we have no further insights. This way we can also explore how diseased tissue looks like compared to healthy ones. So we need to ask ourselves if violet tissue patches have more mammary ducts than rose ones.
