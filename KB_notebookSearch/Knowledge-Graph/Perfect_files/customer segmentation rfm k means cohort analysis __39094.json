We will continue analyzing the UK transactions with customer segmentation. 5 Calculate Monetary Values 5. InvoiceDate Invoice Date and time. Nominal a 6 digit integral number uniquely assigned to each transaction. These plots gives us the total number of unique customers for each country on a country basis. Not necessary Same length both of my last date and df_uk dataset. On the other hand you should inform the K means algorithm about the number of clusters it will predict. Please consider the analysis of your own results as I did. Also with this project I will show you fundamentals of Data Analysis process such as Data Cleaning Data Visualization and Exploratory Data Analysis capabilities. replace False 0 This is not working returns us nothing returns us nothing 1 cancelled based on our tortured dataset 8872 True cancelled based on our original dataset 9288 nunique returns number of unique elements in the specified column. com rfm analysis Recency Frequency Monetary Analysis is a customer segmentation technique for analyzing customer value based on past buying behavior. 4 Data Normalization 1. 2 Visualize analysis of cohort 3 using seaborn and matplotlib 8. 5 Create 2nd Cohort Average Quantity Sold 8. Calculate the frequency of purchases When we look at the definition of invoiceno we see Invoice number. 5 and uniformly distributed data will tend to result in values close to 0. Visualize total cost per country Let s see what our total price graph would look like if we didn t include United Kingdom. You will calculate the Recency Frequency and Monetary values of the customers in the RFM Analysis you will make using the data consisting of UK transactions. Find the unique number of InvoiceNo per customer2. Thus we will use smart initialization called Elbow Method. Now let s find out what a negative UnitPrice means. Customer data is used to sort customers into group based on their behaviors and preferences. The second way to create a segments column. Let s sort it out and get a nicer insight in the next line. 2 Extract the Month of the Purchase 8. Recency Frequency Monetary 3. Then you will compare the classification made by the algorithm with the classification you have made yourself.

It belongs to the family of sparse sampling tests. In general we can say the following at first sight According to the dataset we have United Kingdom has an overwhelming advantage compared to other countries in terms of total number of unique customers. 4 Calculate Frequency Frequency Number of purchasesTo calculate how many times a customer purchased something we need to count how many invoices each customer has. How many customers do we have in each segment 4. After the above operations you will have made cluster estimation with K Means. You will notice that the UK not only has the most sales revenue but also the most customers. invoice date without the timestamp 3. So we can further explore the UK market by learning which products customers buy together and other buying behaviors to improve our sales and targeting strategy. com in emirhan bozdogan Kaggle https www. df cancelled df cancelled. 4 Create 1st Cohort User number Retention Rate 5. COMPARISON OF LOG AND LOG1P For real valued input log1p is accurate also for x so small that 1 x 1 in floating point accuracy. What are the most popular products that are bought in the UK Let s take a look at our columns related to the product from Determines section. If this code starts with letter c it indicates a cancellation. Model FittingFit the K Means Algorithm with the optimal number of clusters you decided and save the model to disk. For example you can label the best customer as Big Spenders and the lost customer as Lost Customer. Define rfm_level function that tags customers by using RFM_Scrores and Create a new variable RFM_Level5. html TRANSFORM provides to combine the output data back with the original dataframe. 7 Explore Customers by Country 1. 5 Create the 2nd Cohort Average Quantity Sold 5. 1 Pivot Cohort and Cohort Retention 2. The log function computes the value of the natural logarithm of argument x. We will segment the customers ourselves based on their recency frequency and monetary values. We did not see any negative value in unitprice but we have zero values. Total Price Quantity X Unit Price 2. 5 K Means Implementation For k means you have to set k to the number of clusters you want but figuring out how many clusters is not obvious from the beginning. This is a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01 12 2010 and 09 12 2011 for a UK based and registered non store online retail. 1 Pivot Cohort and Cohort Retention 8. Create two functions one for Recency and one for Frequency and Monetary. RFM Analysis 5 2. 5 K Means Implementation 7. 6 Create RFM Table 5. 7 Visualize the Clusters 7. These RFM metrics are important indicators of a customer s behavior because frequency and monetary value affects a customer s lifetime value and recency affects retention a measure of engagement. com rfm analysis using bigquery ml bfaa51b83086 RFM Analysis An Effective Customer Segmentation technique using Python https medium. 4 Create 1st Cohort User Number Retention Rate 8. Let s replace the True s to 1 and False s to 0. For Customer Segmentation you will use the df_rfm data set resulting from the RFM analysis. Also evaluate results. This code gives us very good insight but very detailed information. Let s see how much of each product UK has. 2 Visualize analysis of cohort 2 using seaborn and matplotlib modules 5. 2 Define and Plot Feature Correlations Create Heatmap and evaluate the results 4. In the Customer Segmentation section you will create an RFM Segmentation Table where you segment your customers by using the RFM table. Let s start the RFM analysis. In terms of a product a cohort can be a group of people with the same sign up date the same usage starts month date or the same traffic source. These analyzes will help the company develop its sales policies and contribute to the correct use of resources. Now we will use the function created above to convert all the invoice dates into respective month date format. Note Data can be assigned into more groups for better granularity but we will use 4 in this case. The majority of this dataset includes orders from the UK. Create a scatter plot and select cluster centers2. What s the total revenue per country Revenue means total price. We will assign a score from 1 to 4 to each category Recency Frequency and Monetary with 4 being the highest best value. com blog rfm analysis.

But we can not use sum unique nunique etc directly. What s the average number of unqiue items per order or per customer 1. 5 Calculate Monetary Values Monetary Total amount of money spentThe monetary value is calculated by adding together the cost of the customers purchases. First you will create 4 variables that capture the integer value of years months for Invoice and Cohort Date using the get_date_int function which you ll create it below. We need to change it s dtype as datetime We can do the same for the whole dataset but it is not necessary. Conclusion For e commerce organizations cohort analysis provides a tremendous opportunity to find out which customers are most valuable to their business. Way More General 1. T df_model will be created for further analysis in case of not loosing some information about customer. 9 Conclusion Be careful when determining the number of n_clusters and the expressions corresponding to the labels and decision columns as my cluster analysis gives different results each time I run my notebook. You can observe the properties of the resulting clusters with the help of the boxplot. Quantity The quantities of each product item per transaction. 3 Visualize Feature Distributions To get a better understanding of the dataset you can costruct a scatter matrix of each of the three features in the RFM data. Well as the name suggests Customer Segmentation could segment customers according to their precise needs. And as the name of the project suggests I will show and create RFM Cohort and Conduct Cohort Analysis. CustomerID Customer number. Can t deal with different shapes not circular and consider one point s probability of belonging to more than one cluster. You can use the logarithm method to normalize the values in a column. K means has also been widely used for market segmentation and has the advantage of being simple to implement. Cohort Index Calculating time offset for each transaction will allows us to report the metrics for each cohort in a comparable fashion. 2 Visualize analysis of cohort 2 using seaborn and matplotlib modules 8. 5 Clean the Data from the Noise and Missing Values 4. StockCode Product item code. 2 Creating the RFM Segmentation Table. We will try different cluster numbers and check their silhouette coefficient http scikit learn. To calculate recency we need to choose a date as a point of reference to evaluate how many days ago was the customer s last purchase. transform min Count monthly active customers from each cohort Return number of unique elements in the object. 4 Calculate Frequency 5. In this project I will show you what is RFM and how to apply RFM Analysis and Customer Segmentation using K Means Clustering. 1 Calculate RFM Scoring The simplest way to create customer segments from an RFM model is by using Quartiles.

Finally you will do Cohort Analysis with the data you used at the beginning regardless of the analysis you have done before. Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis 1. 2 Take a look at relationships between InvoiceNo Quantity and UnitPrice columns. There is no difference between including the invoiceno column or not. Customer Segmentation with RFM Scores Businesses have this ever lasting urge to understand their customers. map 1 Best_Customers 2 Almost_Lost 0 Lost_Customers def first_of_month date formatted_date dt. Create your plot and resize it. If you specified kde True on the hist plot it returns the kde curve and returns the count value on the vertical axis. Without using transform we can t get output s length same like dataframe4. Now find the last and first selling date of my whole dataset. Before starting the RFM Analysis you will be asked to do some analysis regarding the distribution of Orders Customers and Countries. ratio obtained based on our tortured dataset ratio obtained based on our original dataset We will not use cancelled column again we already did at the beginning So with this operation lines containing canceled orders are dropped. describe include object. Length 387843 Length 387841 So 2 different descriptions written This code gives us very good insight but very detailed information. Customer Segmentation with RFM Scores 6 3. Cohort analysis is the best way to obtain answers to the following questions How effective was a marketing campaign conducted in a given time frame Has the strategy implemented to improve customers conversion rates work Should I focus more on retention rather than acquiring new customers Are my customer nurturing strategies effective Which marketing channels bring me the best results Is there a seasonality pattern in customer behavior 7. 1 Data Pre Processing and Exploring 4. if you don t specified index_col 0 you can not drop duplicates. com understanding k means clustering in machine learning 6a6e67336aa1 since we already have our distinct groups determined. 8 Assign the label 7. com profile ckwspn94d145393876obwft79zug 2. 10 Discussion How we want to continue this analysis depends on how the business plans to use the results and the level of granularity the business stakeholders want to see in the clusters. 6 Define Optimal Cluster Number K by using Elbow Method and Silhouette Analysis Define the Optimal Number of Clusters The Hopkins statistic introduced by Brian Hopkins and John Gordon Skellam is a way of measuring the cluster tendency of a data set. 2 Extract the Month of the Purchase First we will create a function which takes any date and returns the formatted date with day value as 1st of the same month and Year. Score customers from 1 to 4 by applying the functions you have created. There is no assurance that it will lead to the global best solution. 3 Plot RFM Segments 6. 3 What does the letter C in the InvoiceNo column mean If the invoice number starts with the letter C it means the order was cancelled. Plot normalized data with scatter matrix or pairplot. 8 Explore the UK Market 1. The Yellowbrick Elbow method recommends 3 clusters but the silhouette score is too low for 3 n_clouster. So you will continue to analyze only UK transactions in the next RFM Analysis Customer Segmentation and K Means Clustering topics. InvoiceNo Invoice number.

RFM Customer Segmentation Cohort Analysis Greeting the Project 0 About DATA 1 What are We Gonna Do 2 Structure of Work 3 1. 6 Explore the Orders 4. Will be very detailed. html Silhouette_score decreases as the level of detail increases that is as the number of clusters n_clusters increases. Cohort analysis is an analytics method by which these groups can be tracked over time for finding key insights. These are possibly canceled and returned orders. It means some customerid totally 8 are included in multiple country names. It s just a matter of details. In this context it will be useful to examine feature correlations and distributions. To understand what s that difference read the next line. rfm_log decision rfm_log labels. In the next lines we get a more general and understandable output. Choose a date as a point of reference to evaluate how many days ago was the customer s last purchase. Ultimately you have to create an RFM table containing these values. So we don t want to assign these orders to those customers because this would alter the insights we draw from the data. 2 Define and Plot Feature Correlations 7. 3 Calculate Recency Recency Days since last purchaseTo calculate the recency values follow these steps in order 1. An important marketing strategy e commerce businesses use for analyzing and predicting customer value is customer segmentation. Data Cleaning Exploratory Data Analysis 4 1. 2 Visualize analysis of cohort 1 using seaborn and matplotlib modules 5. These disadvantages of K means show that for many datasets especially low dimensional datasets it may not perform as well as you might hope. reset_index pivot_first cohort_first. segments1 segments2 4. Some of the common ways of segmenting customers are based on their Recency Frequency Monatory values their demographics like gender region country etc and some of their business crafted scores. Don t include NaN in the count. 7 Original dataset 8872 or 2 Tortured dataset orders were cancelled. nunique ratio Looking deeper into why these orders were cancelled may prevent future cancellations. From this the following conclusions can be drawn Our first finding regarding the clustering tendency is supported by the score that we obtained with the Hopkins method which we found to be very close to zero. 1 Import Modules Load Data Data Review 4. Country Country name. The final RFM score is calculated by combining all RFM values. In addition the data you apply for K Means should be normalized. Low value customers Cluster 0 The third cluster is more related to the Almost Lost segment as they Haven t purchased for some time R 1 but used to purchase frequently and spent a lot. In the next line we get a more general and understandable output. 1 Data Pre Processing and Exploring 7. Create Cohort and Conduct Cohort Analysis 8 5. Since the dawn of trade this process of understanding customers for a strategic gain has been there practiced and this task is known majorly as Customer Segmentation https clevertap. We can also ask what range of customer behavior from high to low value customers are the stakeholders interested in exploring. We will go with K Means https towardsdatascience.
