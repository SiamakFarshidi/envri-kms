situation in COVID 19 pandemic h3 Number of cases around the world h3 What s the current situation h3 How long since the first outbreak h4 We can see that both China and Korea have hit the inflection point and flattened their curve for epidemic outbreak h4 If we look closely at Italy U S and Spain they are increasing the infected cases with an exponential growth h3 Number of confirmed fatal and recovered cases over time h4 Breakdown by Confirm and Fatal cases h4 We can see that the curve was about to flatten out during mid February however the cases continued to rised abruptly on Feb 10 h3 Let s break down in top 3 countries to see where the spike happened h3 China h3 Italy h4 We can see the total number of active casses in China has gone down in mid Feb so the spike that we saw earlier has to be from other regions h3 US h4 The outbreak started in Italy in mid Feb and in the U S from beginning of March h3 Other countries h4 The rest of the World combined is also seeing a steady increase in confirmed cases over time h3 Which country has the first infected case h3 Let s look at all Europe countries h4 It s clear that the outbreak began in France h3 Let s look at the top 10 Europe countries with outbreaks in a timeline h4 Confirmed Cases h4 Fatality Rate h4 Recovery Rate h3 Let s look at the North America countries and the U S h4 The first case began from the U S h4 We can see that the outbreak started from Washington state on March 9th and the strike leveled up from there h4 Fatality Rate h4 On a positive side even though New York is the most contagious state the fatality rate is still considered small compared to Washington and Lousiana states h4 Recovery Rate h4 Similar to the cases we saw earlier in European countries as the number of infected cases rise the number of recovery cases began to drop This means that we need to supress the cases below the healthcare capacity so that we can prepare stock enough supplies and have sufficient numbers of healthcare workers to serve the patients h3 Let s look into Asia countries h4 In Asia China is the first case of the outbreak h4 Even though Korea has flattened the curve Iran continues to be the rise h4 Fatality Rate h4 Recovery Rate h2 Weather h4 In this section I will break down by temperature in Fahranheit wind speed humidity and sun hours to analyze and find their impact on the transmission rate accordingly h3 Temperature by Country over time h4 This looks like the outbreak mostly widespreads in the region where the average temperature in Fahranheit is around 40 to 60 degrees h3 Windspeed by Country over time h4 According to the graph the outbreak mostly widespreads in the region where the windspeed is around 40 50 miles hour h3 Humidity by Country over time h4 It seems that higher humidity implies higher number of outbreak h3 Sun Hour by Country over time h4 The hours of the sun seem to not correlate with the number of outbreak since they are around 20 hours for almost every country h3 Linear Regression Model h4 Overall h4 According to the multilinear regression model high temperature and humiditiy over have statistically significant impact on the number of Covid 19 transmissions in overall h4 Particular when temperature increase by 1 degree the number of infected cases will decrease approximately 18 cases Similarly if the humidity level goes up by 1 unit there will be nearly a decrease in 9 Covid cases h4 China h4 Similar to the general pattern the high humidity level also significantly decrease the number of Covid 19 infected cases h4 Italy h4 Same with China given everything constant the high level of humidity significantly impact on the decrease of infected cases h4 US h4 In contrast with China and Italy strong wind speed shows statistically significant impact on the confirmed cases In essence the number of cases decrease by nearly 16 people when the wind speed increases by 1 mile hour h4 This is only approximate estimate of the linear coefficients since the U S has 50 states and the weather conditions may vary for different areas h3 Demographic Data h4 Populations by top 20 countries with COVID19 outbreak h4 Top 20 countries with number of COVID19 tests h4 Beside China South Korea is the top 2 country that have the highest number of COVID tests per day Without any quarantine or shelter in place ban the country has curb the COVID 19 spread signficantly by widespread testing only within a month h4 Top 20 countries with the amount of hospital bed per 1 000 people h4 Among the top severe country by Covid 19 South Korea and Germany are among their counterparts to mitigate the death rate This becomes clear when they are the top 2 countries with amount of ICU beds per 1K patients to effectively support healthcare workers save thousand of patients lives h4 Median Age by top 20 countries with COVID19 outbreak h4 People whose ages are above 65 are the most vulnerable towards coronavirus Italy and Spain are among the top 5 countries with highest median age above 40 years old and at the same time with the highest number of fatal rate by Covid 19 h4 Density by top 20 countries with COVID19 outbreak h4 Population with higher density can also relate to the transmission rate of Covid 19 As we can see China France US and South Korea are the top country with high population density h4 Death rate from lung diseases per 100k people by top 20 countries with COVID19 outbreak h4 In later section I will examine the relationship between the death rate by lung diseases with fatal and infected rate by Covid 19 h4 Even though that lung diseases may not directly impact on the number of confirmed and death cases we need more investigation to understand if it correlate to worsening the health condition with people who are positive with Covid 19 in any possible ways h4 In later section I found that the high number of smokers relates with the number of confirmed cases for Covid 19 However more scientific research is needed to be conducted in order to draw the final conclusion h3 What s happened after quarantine h4 China h4 Looking at China curves this followed the pattern that our healthcare experts conducted based on the historical data on Hubei h4 Nearly after 20 days the number of actual outbreak decreased signifcantly h4 However after approximately 15 days of quarantine school shutdowns and travel bans the number of cases in Italy and U S continue to rise exponentially This may due to the fact that China had acted fast as soon as a few cases were detected but this was not the case for Italy and the U S h4 Italy h4 US h4 Merge the Demographic with the train and test data h2 2 SEIR Model h4 Reference h2 What s logistic curve or SEIR model and how they are related to predicting the pandemic h2 Logistic Curve h3 We can already see China and Korea epidemic follwed this curve h3 Logistic Function h4 where h3 Put the function in the current pandemic h3 Growth Equation h4 Even though that China and South Korea Growth Factor has approximated 1 00 U S Italy and Spain are growing fast in the number of infected cases the 2nd Derivative curve is increasing Vietnam my country even though it has no death case so far and still on a very small amount of infected cases there s potential that it will widespread if we do not act now h2 SEIR Model h3 S E I R N h3 Assume there are some intervention

Understand the effect of each demographic variables on the transmission of the virus via multilinear regression model h3 Confirm Cases h4 We can see that density of the population and the number of people who smoke have significantly effects on the increase of the confirmed case While having more ICU beds would decrease the number of transmission by a significant amount h4 We can also see if the country have higher median age the more infected cases they will have h3 Fatal Cases h4 Similarly when we increase the number of ICU beds by 1 unit we can save 8 more people given all the variables in the model Country with higher medium age also have the tendency to witness more fatal cases h2 Combine all original weather distance and demographic data together h3 Random Forest Model h3 Try to
