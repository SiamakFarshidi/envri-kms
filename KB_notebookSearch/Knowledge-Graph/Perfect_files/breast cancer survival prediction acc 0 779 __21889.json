Machine Learning Model for Breast Cancer Survival Prediction using Gene Expression Profiles Problem StatmentMost of us know someone who struggled with breast cancer or at least heard about the struggles facing patients who are fighting against breast cancer. We decided to exclude the mutations from the mdeoling part for now and maybe include it later when we analyse them in more detail. Statistical Summaries of Clinical Columns in the Dataframe What are the characteristics of the average member of the population The average breast cancer patient in the dataset is a 61 year old women with a stage 2 tumor with 2 lymph nodes examined positive with a mean tumor size of 26 mm.

The variable death_from_cancer shows us if the patient is alive or died from cancer or its complications or died of other causes. Also if lower tumor stages the probability of survival is higher than when the patient reaches the fourth stage When the total survival time in months increases the probability of survival increases as well and the probability of dying from reasons other than cancer decrease with time slightly. Huge open source datasets are available for public to analyze and hopefully get some insights. That reference population is all samples in the study.

What are mRNA Z Scores For mRNA expression data The calculations of the relative expression of an individual gene and tumor to the gene s expression distribution in a reference population is done. Comparing the genes expressed in normal and diseased tissue can bring better insights about the cancer prognosis and outcomes. The Distribution of the Two Target Classes in Numerical Clinical Columns in the Dataframe Visualizations Clinical Columns in the DataframeTo compare between the two classes of patients who survived and patients who did not we can see the difference between the two distributions in age_at_diagnosis column as patients who were younger when diagnosed with breast cancer were more likely to survive. Its value is calculated using three pathological criteria the size of the tumour the number of involved lymph nodes and the grade of the tumour. True Negative TN The number of patients who died and were classified as died. 4 dominated the mutation landscape.
