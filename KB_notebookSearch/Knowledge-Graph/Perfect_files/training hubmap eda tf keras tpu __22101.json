Competition Goal Brief The goal of this competition is the implementation of a successful and robust glomeruli FTU detector. YOU CAN TRY USING SEVERAL DIFFERENT ARCHITECTURES AVAILBLE IN SEGEMNTATION MODELS LIBRARY. The glomerulus plural glomeruli is a network of small blood vessels capillaries known as a tuft located at the beginning of a nephron in the kidney. The blood is filtered across the capillary walls of this tuft through the glomerular filtration barrier which yields its filtrate of water and soluble substances to a cup like sac known as Bowman s capsule. The glomerulus is one of the key structures that make up the nephron the functional unit of the kidney. Detect functional tissue units FTUs across different tissue preparation pipelines.
