Training the model Disclaimer most of following code was gathered from all over the internet. this is the method dataloader calls this is what ImageFolder normally returns the image file path make a new tuple that includes original and the path Data augmentation and normalization for training Just normalization for validation Different visualization for train and test Data Line bars Train set Validation set pause a bit so that plots are updated Get a batch of training data Make a grid from batch best_model_wts copy.
