Get Train Val Split from saved W B Artifact Augmentation using Albumentations Visualize Batch Model Callbacks Train with W B Save Model as Artifacts image. csv holds ID for the training images and image level labels. Set Hyperparameters Prepare tf. There are a total of 21 806 training images. Note that they are applied sequentially with some probability p. Consume training CSV Training Dataset Validation Dataset Training batch Validation batch Initialize model Compile model Initialize W B run Train Close W B run Add a file to the artifact s contents Save the artifact version to W B and mark it as the output of this run. Here s a short report summarizing the result http bit. Ref https www. data DataloaderThe train. The idea is to experiment few techniques before leveraging weak supervision for instance segmentation. png attachment image. I am leaving out the yellow channel for now. Apply augmentation policies. IncludesThis Kaggle kernel will document my primary exploits for this competition. RGB 512x512 Dataset Creation Versioning with W B https www. com ayuraj hpa segmentation mask visualization with w b In this kernel I am attempting to understand the use of HPA Cell Segmentation tool provided by the competition hosts. Using EfficientNetB0 with input image size 256x256. com divyanshuusingh eda image segmentation Ref https github. Key features Simple to follow along code. Install Weights and Biases. Here are some of my other kernels. Updates Using Focal Loss. I am also using Weights and Biases W B in this kernel to store train validation split as artifacts. My input data pipeline initially took approx 50 minutes per epoch when I was loading images channels separately and then stacking them. com tensorflow tensorflow issues 16044 convert the compressed string to a 3D uint8 tensor Normalize image resize the image to the desired size Load image Parse label Define the augmentation policies. Imports for augmentations. Set the random seeds RGB images of size 256x256. HPA Segmentation Mask Visualization with W B https www. Setups Installations and ImportsWe will use Weights and Biases for experiment tracking. png Work In Progress Stay Tuned. By using an already stacked image the ETA per epoch is approx 3 mins. Early stopping regularization monitoring val_auc. Binary crossentropy as loss function. ly play with segmentation masks If you like the work upvote for encouragement. I am also using W B s interactive visualization to play with the segmentation masks that are logged. Let s discuss ideas in the comment section. com ayuraj hpa512x512dataset I used this kernel to build RGB dataset of size 512x512 pixels.
