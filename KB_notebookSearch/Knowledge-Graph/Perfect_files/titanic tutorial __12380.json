Then scroll down to find the list of files. Make sure that your notebook outputs the same message above Your submission was successfully saved before moving on. The dataTo take a look at the competition data click on the Data tab at the top of the competition page. This pulls up a list of versions on the right of the screen. These rules govern how many submissions you can make per day the maximum team size and other competition specific details. Ensure that the Save and Run All option is selected and then click on the Save button. _ Then either hit the play button which appears to the left of the blue line or hit Shift Enter on your keyboard. Since it is quite difficult to consider several columns at once or it would take a long time to consider all possible patterns in many different columns simultaneously we ll use machine learning to automate this for us. png You can edit the name by clicking on it. The code also saves these new predictions in a CSV file submission. _If you are interested in deep learning we also offer free GPU access _ Begin by clicking on the Code tab on the competition page. It predicts that all female passengers survived and all male passengers died. We refer to these gray boxes as code cells. png Type the two lines of code below into your second code cell. By the end of the tutorial you ll also have a solid understanding of how to use Kaggle s online coding environment where you ll have trained your own machine learning model. This generates a window in the bottom left corner of the notebook. com learn intro to machine learning course which will help you fully understand all of the code that we ve presented here. To run this code put your cursor in the code cell. To investigate this data click on the name of the file on the left of the screen. csv you have to predict whether the other 418 passengers on board in test. Is this a reasonable first guess We ll check if this pattern holds true in the data in train. There are three files in the data 1 train. It might initially feel overwhelming to look for patterns when there s so much data to sort through. csv file before generating predictions for the passengers in test. if it s a 0 the passenger died. com c titanic and click on the Join Competition button if you haven t already. The code above calculates the percentage of female passengers in train. It constructs the trees in the random forest model based on patterns in the train. For instance the first passenger listed in train. Before moving on make sure that your code returns the output above. This will generate a pop up window. And make sure your cursor is in the code cell before hitting Shift Enter. If you re not already familiar with Python and pandas the code shouldn t make sense to you but don t worry The point of this tutorial is to quickly make your first submission to the competition. So we ll start simple. It uses a Python module called pandas abbreviated as pd to load the table from the train. Then the random forest model makes a democratic decision the outcome with the most votes wins https i. Our competitions often have large cash prizes public leaderboards and involve complex data. Once you re ready click on the Save Version button in the top right corner of your notebook. com kaggle docker python For example here s several helpful packages to load in linear algebra data processing CSV file I O e. csvUsing the patterns you find in train. This shows us where the competition data is stored so that we can load the files into the notebook. Join the competition The first thing to do is to join the competition Open a new window with the competition page https www. In the top left corner you can see the name of your notebook something like kernel2daed3cd79. Logging into Kaggle for the first time can be daunting. csv and 3 gender_submission. csv assumes that all female passengers survived and all male passengers died. Copy the code below into a new code cell. He was 22 years old when he died on the Titanic. read_csv Input data files are available in the. Change it to something more descriptive like Getting Started with Titanic. png Your notebook will take a few seconds to load. Nevertheless we really think all data scientists can rapidly learn from machine learning competitions and meaningfully contribute to our community. _If you ve never written code before or don t have any experience with machine learning don t worry We don t assume any prior experience in this tutorial. To give you a clear understanding of how our platform works and a mental model of the type of learning you could do on Kaggle we ve created a Getting Started tutorial for the Titanic competition. Then click on I Understand and Accept to indicate that you will abide by the competition rules. csv on the left of the screen to examine its contents. csv file into the notebook. Then click on the Submit button to submit your results. Don t forget to click on the play button or hit Shift Enter As before make sure that you see the output above in your notebook before continuing. Copy this code into your notebook and run it in a new code cell. Load the dataThe second code cell in your notebook now appears below the three lines of output with the file locations. Your code should return the output above which corresponds to the first five rows of the table in train. To do this we needed to plug in the location of the file which we saw was kaggle input titanic train. Since gender seems to be such a strong indicator of survival the submission file in gender_submission. As you can imagine by considering multiple columns we can discover more complex patterns that can potentially yield better informed predictions. csv does not have a Survived column this information is hidden from you and how well you do at predicting these hidden values will determine how highly you score in the competition 3 gender_submission. _If you see a Submit Predictions button instead of a Join Competition button you have already joined the competition and don t need to do so again. png Copy the code below into the third code cell of your notebook to load the contents of the test. Then run the code below in another code cell The code above calculates the percentage of male passengers in train. Once you ve done this you can view all of the data in the window. Part 2 Your coding environmentIn this section you ll train your own machine learning model to improve your predictions. Then click on New Notebook. From this you can see that almost 75 of the women on board survived whereas only 19 of the men lived to tell about it. csv is not a bad first guess But at the end of the day this gender based submission bases its predictions on only a single column. The code that you ve just written is in the Python programming language. _The code above shows only the first 5 rows of each table but all of the data is there all 891 rows of train. The challengeThe competition is simple we want you to use the Titanic passenger data name age price of ticket etc to try to predict who will survive and who will die. png Your first lines of codeWhen you start a new notebook it has two gray boxes for storing code. png The values in the second column Survived can be used to determine whether each passenger survived or not if it s a 1 the passenger survived. csv that help us predict whether the passengers in test. Once all of the code runs successfully all of the data in train. Click on the ellipsis. Great work Part 4 Learn more If you re interested in learning more we strongly suggest our 3 hour Intro to Machine Learning https www. csv file is provided as an example that shows how you should structure your predictions. After it has finished running click on the number to the right of the Save Version button. csvThe gender_submission. png This takes you to the rules acceptance page. csv _ Part 3 Your first submissionRemember our goal we want to find patterns in train. You can use Kaggle Notebooks to getting up and running with writing code quickly and without having to install anything on your computer. png The code cell below looks for patterns in four different columns Pclass Sex SibSp and Parch of the data. But just like this file your submission should have a PassengerId column containing the IDs of each passenger from test. csv and all 418 rows of test. csv contains the details of a subset of the passengers on board 891 passengers to be exact where each passenger gets a different row in the table. This model is constructed of several trees there are three trees in the picture below but we ll construct 100 that will individually consider each passenger s data and vote on whether the individual survived. At this point you should have at least three code cells in your notebook. png The first code cell already has some code in it. At the end of the tutorial we suggest resources to continue your learning. It walks you through the initial steps required to get your first decent submission on the leaderboard. Click on the Output tab on the right of the screen. Again don t worry if this code doesn t make sense to you For now we ll focus on how to generate and submit predictions. So if this is your first time entering a Kaggle competition regardless of whether you have experience with handling large datasets haven t done much coding are newer to data science or are relatively experienced but are just unfamiliar with Kaggle s platform you re in the right place Part 1 Get startedIn this section you ll learn more about the competition and make your first submission. It s very important that you see this output in your notebook before proceeding with the tutorial _If your code does not produce this output_ double check that your code is identical to the two lines above. You must accept the competition rules in order to participate. If the code runs successfully three lines of output are returned. _If your cursor is in the right place you ll notice a blue vertical line to the left of the gray box. Then once you re done either click on the blue play button or hit Shift Enter. Explore a patternRemember that the sample submission file in gender_submission. png Congratulations for making your first submission to a Kaggle competition Within ten minutes you should receive a message providing your spot on the leaderboard. Below you can see the same code that you just ran along with the output that you should see in your notebook. You ll also know enough to generate even better predictions This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed It is defined by the kaggle python docker image https github. csv is loaded in the notebook. a Survived column that you will create with a 1 for the rows where you think the passenger survived and a 0 where you predict that the passenger died. Your first machine learning modelWe ll build what s known as a random forest model. _ The NotebookThe first thing to do is to create a Kaggle Notebook where you ll store all of your code. For example running this by clicking run or pressing Shift Enter will list all files under the input directory Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.
