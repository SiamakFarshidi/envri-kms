About This Notebook This notebook tried to demonstrate the use of Transfer learning using Pytorch and how to combine image features with dense features for various tasks. png Source https www. Example https www. We are not using the full capability of it here since it is a starter model but practicing similar definitions will help if when you decide to play around a little more with the NN layers and functions. Tip Not all augmentations are applicable in all conditions. Valid Augmentations Dataset 1. But why do we need to do that 1. If we make a poor initial choice in learning rate our model may be stuck from the very start. CNN ModelWe will inherit from the nn. Refer this link https www. We use a vanilla vit_large_patch32_384 model for extracting image embeddings and concatenate them with the dense features on the last layer on a NN. Why this competition As evident from the problem statement this competition presents an interesting challenge for a good cause. Get GPU Info Installations Imports CFG AugmentationsThere a well known concept called image augmentations in CNN. Also we are using timm for instancing a pre trained model. With the help of data science we will accurately determine a pet photo s appeal to give these rescue animals a higher chance of loving homes. With that in mind let s define our augmentations 1. Visualize Some Examples Metrics SchedulerScheduler is essentially an function that changes our learning rate over epochs steps. Currently PetFinder. You might expect pets with attractive photos to generate more interest and be adopted faster. jpg Problem Statement Millions of stray animals suffer on the streets or are euthanized in shelters every day around the world. Also if successful the solution can be adapted into tools that will can shelters and rescuers around the world to improve the appeal of their pet profiles automatically enhancing photo quality and consequently helping animals find a suitable hjome much faster. There are also some basic info on the photograph as dense features on the train. I hope you have learnt something from this notebook. Train Augmentations 2. It has an extensive list of image augmentations the full list can be found in their documentation https albumentations. Problem CategoryFrom the data and objective its is evident that this is a Regression Problem in the Computer Vision domain. Data DescriptionImage data is stored in a jpg image format in training folder and the dense features and target scores are mentioned in the train. Expected OutcomeGiven a photo a pet animal and some basic information about the photo as dense features we should be able to estimate the pawpularity score of the pet. my images cuteness_meter. If you liked this notebook and use parts of it in you code please show some support by upvoting this kernel. io pytorch image models Train and Validation Functions 1. my uses a basic Cuteness Meter to rank pet photos. I have created this notebook as a baseline model which you can easily fork and paly around with to get much better results. com c petfinder pawpularity score discussion 275094 for description regarding using this particular methodology. What augmentation generally does is it artificially increases the dataset size by subtly modifying the existing images to create new ones while training. Module class to define our model. csv file where the Id of each row corresponds to an unique image in the training folder. net publication 319413978 figure fig2 AS 533727585333249 1504261980375 Data augmentation using semantic preserving transformation for SBIR. One added advantage of this is The model becomes more generalized and focuses to finding features and representations rather than completely overfitting to the training data. Example If your task is to identify if a person is standing or sleeping applying a rotational augmentation can make the model worse. It really depends on the dataset and the problem. In practice using CLRs leads to far fewer learning rate tuning experiments along with near identical accuracy to exhaustive hyperparameter tuning. This is a easy as well as effective way of defining the model as it allows very granular control over the complete NN. The first reason is that our network may become stuck in either saddle points or local minima and the low learning rate may not be sufficient to break out of the area and descend into areas of the loss landscape with lower loss. If you found this notebook useful and use parts of it in your work please don t forget to show your appreciation by upvoting this kernel. Validate Function RunThis is a simple starter kernel on implementation of Transfer Learning using Pytorch for this problem. pngOne of the most popular image augmentation libraries is Albumentations. It is known that transformer based models are performing better than classic CNN based models on this dataset. It analyzes picture composition and other factors compared to the performance of thousands of pet profiles. Grading MetricSubmissions are evaluated on RMSE between the predicted value and the observed target. It also sometimes helps the model train on more noisy data as compared to conventional methods. The complete list of Pytorch pre trained image models through timm can be found here https rwightman. That keeps me motivated and inspires me to write and share these public kernels. Break out of saddle points and local minima. com manabendrarout transformers classifier method starter infer TLDR We treat this problem as a classification problem by scaling all targets between 0 1 and use cross entropy loss as loss function. Pytorch has many SOTA Image models which you can try out using the guidelines in this notebook. Instead we can use Schedulers and specifically Cyclical Learning Rates CLR to oscillate our learning rate between upper and lower bounds enabling us to Have more freedom in our initial learning rate choices.
