In this notebook we will cover the following linear algorithms 1. Ridge Regression Source scikit learn http scikit learn. Area Number of Bedrooms Avg Number of Bedrooms for Houses in same city Area Population Population of city hou se is located in Price Price that the house sold at Address Address for the house Import Libraries Check out the Data Exploratory Data Analysis EDA Let s create some simple plots to check out the data Training a Linear Regression Model Let s now begin to train out regression model We will need to first split up our data into an X array that contains the features to train on and a y array with the target variable in this case the Price column. data whose distribution can be explained by some set of model parameters though may be subject to noise and outliers which are data that do not fit the model. Elastic Net A linear regression model trained with L1 and L2 prior as regularizer. LASSO Regression A linear model that estimates sparse coefficients. log transform for an exponential relationship. In practice you can uses these rules more as rules of thumb when using Ordinary Least Squares Regression the most common implementation of linear regression. By considering linear fits within a higher dimensional space built with these basis functions the model has the flexibility to fit a much broader range of data. Robust Regression Robust regression is a form of regression analysis designed to overcome some limitations of traditional parametric and non parametric methods. org stable modules linear_model. Try different preparations of your data using these heuristics and see what works best for your problem. com linear regression for machine learning sns. In the standard linear regression case you might have a model that looks like this for two dimensional data hat y w x w_0 w_1 x_1 w_2 x_2 If we want to fit a paraboloid to the data instead of a plane we can combine the features in second order polynomials so that the model looks like this hat y w x w_0 w_1 x_1 w_2 x_2 w_3 x_1 x_2 w_4 x_1 2 w_5 x_2 2 The sometimes surprising observation is that this is still a linear model to see this imagine creating a new variable z x_1 x_2 x_1 x_2 x_1 2 x_2 2 With this re labeling of the data our problem can be written hat y w x w_0 w_1 z_1 w_2 z_2 w_3 z_3 w_4 z_4 w_5 z_5 We see that the resulting polynomial regression is in the same class of linear models we d considered above i. Predictions from our ModelLet s grab predictions off our test set and see how well it did Residual Histogram Regression Evaluation MetricsHere are three common evaluation metrics for regression problems Mean Absolute Error MAE is the mean of the absolute value of the errors frac 1n sum_ i 1 n y_i hat y _i Mean Squared Error MSE is the mean of the squared errors frac 1n sum_ i 1 n y_i hat y _i 2 Root Mean Squared Error RMSE is the square root of the mean of the squared errors sqrt frac 1n sum_ i 1 n y_i hat y _i 2 Comparing these metrics MAE is the easiest to understand because it s the average error. A common situation in which robust estimation is used occurs when the data contain outliers. Ridge regression is an L2 penalized model. The outliers can come for example from extreme values of the noise or from erroneous measurements or incorrect hypotheses about the interpretation of data. Polynomial Regression 7. How to evaluate a linear regression model. For example a simple linear regression can be extended by constructing polynomial features from the coefficients. the model is linear in w and can be solved by the same techniques. Therefore it also can be interpreted as an outlier detection method. RANSAC also assumes that given a usually small set of inliers there exists a procedure which can estimate the parameters of a model that optimally explains or fits this data. Area Number of Bedrooms is associated with an increase of 2233. Area Number of Rooms Avg Number of Rooms for Houses in same city Avg. Since house price is a continues variable this is a regression problem. RMSE is even more popular than MSE because RMSE is interpretable in the y units. Interpreting the coefficients Holding all other features fixed a 1 unit increase in Avg. Learning algorithms used to estimate the coefficients in the model. Area House Age is associated with an increase of 164883. You may get some benefit using transforms e. As such there is a lot of sophistication when talking about these requirements and expectations which can be intimidating. Linear regression assumes that the relationship between your input and output is linear. This may be obvious but it is good to remember when you have a lot of attributes. You may need to transform data to make the relationship linear e. Holding all other features fixed a 1 unit increase in Avg. A practical advantage of trading off between Lasso and Ridge is it allows Elastic Net to inherit some of Ridge s stability under rotation. use fivethirtyeight print the intercept warm_start True model. Consider calculating pairwise correlations for your input data and removing the most correlated. Area House Age Avg Age of Houses in same city Avg. Robust regression methods are designed to be not overly affected by violations of assumptions by the underlying data generating process. Remove Collinearity. Linear Regression with Python Linear Regression is the simplest algorithm in machine learning it can be trained in different ways. Income of residents of the city house is located in. We will train out model on the training set and then use the test set to evaluate the model. MSE is more popular than MAE because MSE punishes larger errors which tends to be useful in the real world. Linear regression will over fit your data when you have highly correlated input variables. Rescale Inputs Linear regression will often make more reliable predictions if you rescale input variables using standardization or normalization. It does not support anything else. html ridge regression Ridge regression addresses some of the problems of Ordinary Least Squares by imposing a penalty on the size of coefficients. All of these are loss functions because we want to minimize them. Holding all other features fixed a 1 unit increase in Area Population is associated with an increase of 15. Preparing Data For Linear Regression Linear regression is been studied at great length and there is a lot of literature on how your data must be structured to make best use of the model. The general idea of Gradient Sescent is to tweak parameters iteratively in order to minimize a cost function. Stochastic Gradient Descent Gradient Descent is a very generic optimization algorithm capable of finding optimal solutions to a wide range of problems. In many situations including some areas of geostatistics and medical statistics it is precisely the outliers that are of interest. Gradient Descent measures the local gradient of the error function with regards to the parameters vector and it goes in the direction of descending gradient. You covered a lot of ground including The common linear regression models Ridge Lasso ElasticNet. We will toss out the Address column because it only has text info that the linear regression model can t use. In the presence of outliers that do not come from the same data generating process as the rest of the data least squares estimation is inefficient and can be biased. One instance in which robust estimation should be considered is when there is a strong suspicion of heteroscedasticity. html polynomial regression extending linear models with basis functions One common pattern within machine learning is to use linear models trained on nonlinear functions of the data. Linear Regression 2. Linear regression assumes that your input and output variables are not noisy. Consider using data cleaning operations that let you better expose and clarify the signal in your data. This approach maintains the generally fast performance of linear methods while allowing them to fit a much wider range of data. Stochastic Gradient Descent 8. Robust Regression 3. Linear Assumption. Area Number of Rooms is associated with an increase of 122368. Mathematically it consists of a linear model trained with ell_1 prior as regularizer. Because the least squares predictions are dragged towards the outliers and because the variance of the estimates is artificially inflated the result is that outliers can be masked. Area Income is associated with an increase of 21. The data contains the following columns Avg. A basic assumption is that the data consists of inliers i. log or BoxCox on you variables to make their distribution more Gaussian looking. Random Sample Consensus RANSAC Random sample consensus RANSAC is an iterative method to estimate parameters of a mathematical model from a set of observed data that contains outliers when outliers are to be accorded no influence on the values of the estimates. set_style whitegrid plt. The representation used by the model. Linear Regression Model EvaluationLet s evaluate the model by checking out it s coefficients and how we can interpret them. The ridge coefficients minimize a penalized residual sum of squares min_ w big big Xw y big big 2_2 alpha big big w big big 2_2 alpha 0 is a complexity parameter that controls the amount of shrinkage the larger the value of alpha the greater the amount of shrinkage and thus the coefficients become more robust to collinearity. This combination allows for learning a sparse model where few of the weights are non zero like Lasso while still maintaining the regularization properties of Ridge. The objective function to minimize is in this case min_ w frac 1 2n_ samples big big X w y big big _2 2 alpha rho big big w big big _1 frac alpha 1 rho 2 big big w big big _2 2 Polynomial Regression Source scikit learn http scikit learn. Rules of thumb to consider when preparing data for use with linear regression. html supervised learning Linear Regression for Machine Learning by Jason Brownlee PhD https machinelearningmastery. References Scikit learn library https scikit learn. Linear regression will make more reliable predictions if your input and output variables have a Gaussian distribution. X and y arrays Train Test SplitNow let s split the data into a training set and a testing set. org stable supervised_learning. Once the gradient is zero you have reached a minimum. Lasso is likely to pick one of these at random while elastic net is likely to pick both. Add the squared sum of the weights to the least squares cost function. Gaussian Distributions. Does this make sense Probably not because I made up this data. The objective function to minimize is min_ w frac 1 2n_ samples big big Xw y big big _2 2 alpha big big w big big _1 The lasso estimate thus solves the minimization of the least squares penalty with alpha big big w big big _1 added where alpha is a constant and big big w big big _1 is the ell_1 norm of the parameter vector. This is most important for the output variable and you want to remove outliers in the output variable y if possible. Artificial Neaural Networks Data We are going to use the USA_Housing dataset.
