Note that the subjectivity is still high as it is still an opinion and not a factOne can extract the individual components as follows Finally let s look at a neutral sentence with no sentimentThe sentence above is a neutral factual sentence with no sentiment. We observe that there is indeed a positive but not very strong correlation between the sentiment of the reviews and the ratings given 0. Let s extract the review column for the sentiment analysis. A few basic steps that can be taken to improve our sentiment calculation are 1. Pre processing Clean up the text. This will give a more accurate sentiment scoreWe would still run into a few road blocks. Since we are dealing with reviews of drugs here we would certainly be interested in understanding the sentiment associated with these reviews and try to see which drugs have positive reviews and which ones have negative reviews. Visualizing the correlationWe notice a gentle upward slope for median sentiment for each of the rating buckets Improving the sentiment analysisThis was a very simple intro to sentiment analysis. Our hypothesis would be that reviews with postive reviews would have higher polarity values and vice versa. Although the correlation is weak it is still a useful feature for us to make predictions from as it isn t close to 0. Do stemming lemmatization. Polarity ranges from 1 to 1. Note that there are 2 sentences here in the review. Then re run the sentiment analysis on the polar sentences. Remove neutral sentences Do sentiment analysis of individual sentences in a review and remove neutral ones. It comes pre loaded in Kaggle kernels. The neutral sentences dillute the overall polarity of the text. This object is the representation that textblob uses for the given blob of text under the hood. It parses the text to let us extract the sentiment or other useful metrics from the sentence. Correlation with ratingsLet s see if the newly calculated sentiments have any correlation with the ratings. It is less effective when we have several neutral sentences along with ones with high polarity. The first step is to create a TextBlob object. Subjectivity ranges from 0 to 1 with 0 for objective factual sentences and 1 for highly opinionated ones. Sentiment analysis works best for short sentences with an obvious sentiment. We note that the sentiments calculated are only weakly correlated with the ratings suggesting that there is a lot of room for improvement. I hope that you find this kernel useful and informative Play around with textblob to get an idea of its capabilities and limitations. Identifying the sentiment of a review can help us make an attempt at predicting the rating that the user would give to the given product The TextBlob libraryWe will do this analysis using the open source library called TextBlob https textblob. Once the TextBlob object is created extracting the sentiment is a single command. Let s start by importing TextBlob. Let s look at a negative exampleThe sentiment is 1 now indicating that is a negative review. We will ignore subjectivity for the time being as we are looking at reviews and they re all fundamentally subjective Let s try it on our dataThe data has over 160K rows. Idioms pop culture references. IntroductionSentiment Analysis is the identification of the sentiment associated with a sentence phrase or an entire document. Consider a simple dummy review which could be a highly positive one. Using the sentiment method spits out 2 numbers Polarity and Subjectivity. TextBlob let s us do our sentiment analysis really fast without having to write a lot of code. It can take a while to calculate the sentiment for 160K samples Add this list of sentiments to the original dataframeLet s randomly sample 10 rows from the data and see what we gotNotice that the sentiment values even for reviews with high ratings tend to be low. For our application polarity is more useful than subjectivity. Some of the harder to solve problems where naive sentiment analysis struggles are 1. This object is created by passing a simple string. This is a positive review so the polarity is close to 1. html which is a really easy to use Natural Language Processing library written on top of a powerful but relatively harder to use framework called NLTK https www. Hence it has 0 polarity and 0 subjectivity. Extract sentiments for all these reviews We ll use tqdm to track our progress. Analyzing these would require more advanceed NLP techniques and is an active research field. This happens because the reviews are long.
