So keep that in mind when improving your model. Supervised learning is where you train the model by presenting it a training dataset that includes the correct answer. Using the same dataset and different implementation of a decision tree adaboost random forest gradient boost xgboost etc. Completing There are null values or missing data in the age cabin and embarked field. So another step in data modeling is feature selection. Step 7 Optimize and Strategize ConclusionIteration one of the Data Science Framework seems to converge on 0. However we want to use caution when we modify data from its original value because it may be necessary to create an accurate model. It is not recommended to delete the record especially a large percentage of records unless it truly represents an incomplete record. We then hope to present it a new subset from the same dataset and have similar results in prediction accuracy. In the next step we will worry about transforming dirty data to clean data. They will be converted to dummy variables for mathematical calculations. html classification Some advantages of decision trees are Simple to understand and to interpret. Question 5A going down the female class 3 embarked S branch with count 88 So far it looks like we made good decisions. One I found was fare 0 8 majority survived. In coding it s okay to try fail and try again. In this kernel I use Kaggle s Getting Started Competition Titanic Machine Learning from Disaster to walk the reader through how to use the data science framework to beat the odds. However since they are reasonable values we will wait until after we complete our exploratory analysis to determine if we should include or exclude from the dataset. linear_model Naive Bayes http scikit learn. This created wide margins between the cross validation CV accuracy score and Kaggle submission accuracy score. It may be external or internal structured or unstructured static or streamed objective or subjective etc. org attachments 10778 10778 boost. Other techniques are usually specialized in analyzing datasets that have only one type of variable. Chapter 2 A Data Science Framework ch2 1. org papers volume15 delgado14a delgado14a. 22 Clean DataNow that we know what to clean let s execute our code. com 2015 06 machine learning more data better algorithms. It s important to remember algorithms are tools and not magical wands or silver bullets. jpg A Data Science Framework1. org Classes ENGR5358 Papers NFL_4_Dummies. Remember the name of the game is to create subgroups using a decision tree model to get survived 1 in one bucket and dead 0 in another bucket. CV is basically a shortcut to split and score our model multiple times so we can get an idea of how well it will perform on unseen data. html cross validation that splits our dataset into train and test for data modeling comparison. Not bad for a few lines of code. DataFrame https pandas. That makes it possible to account for the reliability of the model. Subsequent model iterations may modify this decision to determine if it improves the model s accuracy. 0 max_features None random_state None max_leaf_nodes None min_impurity_decrease 0. In laymen terms this means it either occurred or did not occur. Mechanisms such as pruning not currently supported setting the minimum number of samples required at a leaf node or setting the maximum depth of the tree are necessary to avoid this problem. This subgroup 55 died and 33 survived since majority died we need to find a signal to identify the 33 or a subgroup to change them from dead to survived and improve our model accuracy. gov pmc articles PMC3103196 done by the NIH for genomic selection Fernandez Delgado et al. Therefore normal processes in data wrangling such as data architecture governance and extraction are out of scope. So with all this information where is a beginner to start I recommend starting with Trees Bagging Random Forests and Boosting http jessica2. Project Summary The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. For this dataset we will convert object datatypes to categorical dummy variables. Hello and Welcome to Kaggle the online Data Science Community to learn share and compete. The Name variable is a nominal datatype. To begin this step we first import our data. On April 15 1912 during her maiden voyage the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. The author will theorize that for small datasets a manmade algorithm is the bar to beat. Decision tree learners create biased trees if some classes dominate. Practice Skills Binary classification Python and R basics Step 2 Gather the DataThe dataset is also given to us on a golden plater with test and train data at Kaggle s Titanic Machine Learning from Disaster https www. Since our problem is predicting if a passenger survived or did not survive this is a discrete target variable. The Sex and Embarked variables are a nominal datatype. This can be used for feature engineering to create a family size and is alone variable. Class 3 is even at a 50 50 split. That s why I took the time in the previous sections to show you how predictions work. tree Discriminant Analysis http scikit learn. The PassengerID and Ticket variables are assumed to be random unique identifiers that have no impact on the outcome variable. programming languages computer systems etc. Click here to learn more about ROC_AUC scores http www. In addition to CV we used a customized sklearn train test splitter http scikit learn. So think of it like a coin flip problem. It is therefore recommended to balance the dataset prior to fitting with the decision tree. Below is an image of the default CV split. We slightly improve our accuracy but not much to move us past 82. The same is true in data modelling. com categorical encoding. Most beginners get lost in the field because they fall into the black box approach using libraries and algorithms they don t understand. html multimetric cross validation function to train test and score our model performance. qualitative vs quantitative is also important to understand and select the correct hypothesis test or data model. org stable modules model_evaluation. An intermediate methodology is to use the basic methodology based on specific criteria like the average age by class or embark port by fare and SES. Despite tuning no machine learning algorithm exceeded the homemade algorithm. The Pclass variable is an ordinal datatype for the ticket class a proxy for socio economic status SES representing 1 upper class 2 middle class and 3 lower class. Decision trees can be unstable because small variations in the data might result in a completely different tree being generated. Credits ch91 How to Use this Tutorial Read the explanations provided in this Kernel and the links to developer documentation. Chapter 6 Step 4 Perform Exploratory Analysis with Statistics ch6 1. It could be used in feature engineering to derive the gender from title family size from surname and SES from titles like doctor or master. pdf comparing 179 classifiers from 17 families Thoma 2016 sklearn comparison https martin thoma. It s important to note more predictor variables do not make a better model but the right variables. predicting data is logarithmic in the number of data points used to train the tree. Got it Let s go Question 1 Were you on the Titanic If Yes then majority 62 died. Also the dead subgroup is less than 10 so we will stop. Chapter 7 Step 5 Model Data ch7 1. One side note logistic regression while it has regression in the name is really a classification algorithm. in an artificial neural network results may be more difficult to interpret. Female majority 74 survived. Last we ll need some business acumen to think through the problem. 99 of the time someone else had the same question problem and already asked the coding community. Model Data Like descriptive and inferential statistics data modeling can either summarize the data or predict future outcomes. isnull https pandas. Uses a white box model. They are basically different implementations of a decision tree which is the easiest concept to learn and understand. html Sklearn LabelEncoder http scikit learn. It s very powerful and helps you with a lot of the grunt work. ca fidler teaching 2015 slides CSC411 tutorial3_CrossVal DTs. Surprisingly class or even embarked didn t matter like it did for females but title does and gets us to 82. statistics linear algebra etc. If you ve exhausted all your resources the Kaggle Community via forums and comments can help too. Our rule of thumb will be the majority rules. S the majority 63 died. Adding another level does not seem to gain much more information. Below are available hyper parameters and defintions http scikit learn. In this stage you will find yourself classifying features and determining their correlation with the target variable and each other. net solomon_caruana_wslmw of MLA comparisons Ogutu et al. model_selection to allow a little more randomness in our test scoring. html Indexing and Selecting Data https pandas. Chapter 11 Step 6 Validate and Implement ch11 1. By contrast in a black box model e. Think of MLA like a TI 89 calculator on a Calculus Exam. If you do run into problems Google is your second best friend because 99. The wrong model can lead to poor performance at best and the wrong conclusion that s used as actionable intelligence at worst. There are concepts that are hard to learn because decision trees do not express them easily such as XOR parity or multiplexer problems. But we have information about the dataset so we should be able to do better. neighbors Support Vector Machines SVM http scikit learn. The goal is to not just learn the whats but the whys. The SibSp represents number of related siblings spouse aboard and Parch represents number of related parents children aboard. This helps ensure you haven t overfit your model or made it so specific to the selected subset that it does not accurately fit another subset from the same dataset. You must still be the master craft wo man that knows how to select the right tool for the job. Meaning the algorithm is so specific to a given subset it cannot accurately generalize another subset from the same dataset. You did it with very little information we get to 82 accuracy. Change Log ch90 1. Therefore if we just predict the most frequent occurrence that 100 of people died then we would be right 67. Thus only data cleaning is in scope. Interesting for this dataset the simple decision tree algorithm had the best default submission score and with tuning achieved the same best accuracy score. Chapter 1 How a Data Scientist Beat the Odds ch1 1. If a given situation is observable in a model the explanation for the condition is easily explained by Boolean logic. The idea is why write ten lines of code when you can write one line. In later sections we will also use sklearn s cross validation functions http scikit learn. This is called overfitting. There are two common methods either delete the record or populate the missing value using a reasonable input. html Sklearn OneHotEncoder http scikit learn. Problems before requirements requirements before solutions solutions before design and design before technology. Able to handle multi output problems. 1 Evaluate Model PerformanceLet s recap with some basic data cleaning analysis and machine learning algorithms MLA we are able to predict passenger survival with 82 accuracy. Missing values can be bad because some algorithms don t know how to handle null values and will fail. org stable modules cross_validation. Requires little data preparation. Able to handle both numerical and categorical data. For this dataset age will be imputed with the median the cabin attribute will be dropped and embark will be imputed with mode. On a worst bad good better and best scale we ll set 82 to good since it s a simple model that yields us decent results. pdf of Machine Learning. However data science is like a three legged stool with no one leg being more important than the other. We know that 1 502 2 224 or 67. Instead it s best to impute missing values. C and Q the majority still survived so no change. Machine Learning ML as the name suggest is teaching the machine how to think and not what to think. We will then visualize our tree with graphviz http scikit learn. Your dataset and expected results will determine the algorithms available for use. It is a binary nominal datatype of 1 for survived and 0 for did not survive. At best it shows a complete lack of understanding. 2 Meet and Greet DataThis is the meet and greet step. So now that I ve hammered no pun intended my point I ll show you what to do and most importantly WHY you do it. All other variables are potential predictor or independent variables. While no general conclusions can be made from testing a handful of algorithms on a single dataset there are several observations on the mentioned dataset. This problem is mitigated by using decision trees within an ensemble. Below I ll give an overview of how to run and compare several MLAs but the rest of this Kernel will focus on learning data modeling via decision trees and its derivatives. Machine learning can be categorized as supervised learning unsupervised learning and reinforced learning. We will use a classification algorithm from the sklearn library to begin our analysis. There are no date or currency formats but datatype formats. Too often we are quick to jump on the new shiny technology tool or algorithm before determining the actual problem we are trying to solve. When creating a decision tree you want to ask questions that segment your target response placing the survived 1 and dead 0 into homogeneous subgroups. That s why I focus on teaching you not just what to do but why you re doing it. In addition data categorization i. A common business application is churn or customer retention. Correcting Reviewing the data there does not appear to be any aberrant or non acceptable data inputs. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships. In short NFLT states there is no super algorithm that works best in all situations for all datasets. feature_selection has several options we will use recursive feature elimination RFE with cross validation CV http scikit learn. So chances are the dataset s already exist somewhere in some format. describe https pandas. Optimize and Strategize This is the bionic man step where you iterate back through the process to make it better. com wp content uploads 2016 03 hilarious autocorrect fails 20x. Other techniques often require data normalization dummy variables need to be created and blank values to be removed. It s important our algorithm has not seen the subset we will use to test so it doesn t cheat by memorizing the answers. But don t worry we only need a high level overview which we ll cover in this Kernel. Remember it s important we use a different subset for train data to build our model and test data to evaluate our model. Question 2 Are you male or female Male majority 81 died. html Pandas Categorical dtype https pandas. This is important so we don t overfit our model https www. value_counts https pandas. It should be noted that if they were unreasonable values for example age 800 instead of 80 then it s probably a safe decision to fix now. Sklearn http scikit learn. org pandas docs stable generated pandas. Click here for the Source Data Dictionary https www. Chapter 4 Step 3 Prepare Data for Consumption ch4 1. An analogy would be asking someone to hand you a Philip screwdriver and they hand you a flathead screwdriver or worst a hammer. So we will change females class 3 embarked S from assuming they survived to assuming they died. Developer Documentation pandas. Get to know your data by first name and learn a little bit about it. And reinforced learning is a hybrid of the previous two where the model is not given the correct answer immediately but later after a sequence of events to reinforce learning. qualitative vs quantitative. No new information to improve our model is gained. We can generalize that a continuous target variable requires a regression algorithm and a discrete target variable requires a classification algorithm. Guess and checking other features none seem to push us past 82. Once you re able to package your ideas this becomes your currency exchange rate. computer science i. CV http blog test. Data wrangling includes implementing data architectures for storage and processing developing data governance standards for quality and control data extraction i. Such algorithms cannot guarantee to return the globally optimal decision tree. org stable modules generated sklearn. 12 Tune Model with Hyper ParametersWhen we used sklearn Decision Tree DT Classifier http scikit learn. com blog_assets Scikit_Learn_Cheat_Sheet_Python. Another popular use case is healthcare s mortality rate or survival analysis. pdf watch video lecture here http videolectures. org pandas docs stable indexing. Nonetheless if we assumed everybody died our sample accuracy is 62. But if you don t know what you re doing on the exam a calculator even a TI 89 is not going to help you pass. 0 we used sklearn cross_validate http scikit learn. Chapter 8 Evaluate Model Performance ch8 1. I provide clear explanations clean code and plenty of links to resources. Given the same dataset decision tree based algorithms seemed to converge on the same accuracy score after proper tuning. Also we will stop if the subgroup is less than 10 and or our model accuracy plateaus or decreases. 77990 submission accuracy. 13 Tune Model with Feature SelectionAs stated in the beginning more predictor variables do not make a better model but the right predictors do. How a Data Scientist Beat the OddsIt s the classical problem predict the outcome of a binary event. Data Science 101 How to Create Your Own Model Our accuracy is increasing but can we do better Are there any signals in our data To illustrate this we re going to build our own decision tree model because it is the easiest to conceptualize and requires simple addition and multiplication calculations. and y dependent target outcome response etc. The disadvantages of decision trees include Decision tree learners can create over complex trees that do not generalize the data well. Below are common classes to load. 23 Convert FormatsWe will convert categorical data to dummy variables for mathematical analysis. But the question we always ask is can we do better and more importantly get an ROI return on investment for our time invested For example if we re only going to increase our accuracy by 1 10th of a percent is it really worth 3 months of development. This is part science and part art so let s just play the 21 question game to show you how it works. It s good because these algorithms are now accessible to more people that can solve more problems in the real world. What happens when technology is too smart for its own good Funny Autocorrect http 15858 presscdn 0 65. 21 The 4 C s of Data Cleaning Correcting Completing Creating and ConvertingIn this stage we will clean our data by 1 correcting aberrant values and outliers 2 completing missing information 3 creating new features for analysis and 4 converting fields to the correct format for calculations and presentation. com c titanic data Step 3 Prepare Data for ConsumptionSince step 2 was provided to us on a golden plater so is step 3. To do that we have to go back to the basics of data science 101. and business management i. If you don t understand something in the code the print function is your best friend. It s like cheating on a school quiz to get 100 but then when you go to take the exam you fail because you never truly learned anything. with tuning does not exceed the 0. Chapter 5 The 4 C s of Data Cleaning Correcting Completing Creating and Converting ch5 1. Binary events create an interesting dynamic because we know statistically a random guess should achieve a 50 accuracy rate without creating one single algorithm or writing one single line of code. Perform Exploratory Analysis Anybody who has ever worked with data knows garbage in garbage out GIGO. Step 1 Define the ProblemFor this project the problem statement is given to us on a golden plater develop an algorithm to predict the survival outcome of passengers on the Titanic. com wp content uploads 2015 04 B fig 1. Step 4 Perform Exploratory Analysis with StatisticsNow that our data is cleaned we will explore our data with descriptive and graphical statistics to describe and summarize our variables. So study the next section wisely. While others like decision trees can handle null values. However just like autocorrect spellcheck technology sometimes we humans can be too smart for our own good and actually underperform a coin flip. Create a pivot table with survival in the columns count and of row count in the values and the features described below in the rows. Otherwise our model will be overfitted. So problems that once required graduate degrees in mathematics or statistics now only take a few lines of code. Converting Last but certainly not least we ll deal with formatting. So the best approach is to try multiple MLAs tune them and compare them for your specific scenario. faster than it was before. At worst it makes completing the project impossible. Libraries provide pre written functionality to perform necessary tasks. So let s set 68 as bad model performance because again anything lower than that then why do I need you when I can just predict using the most frequent occurrence. We ll save clustering and dimension reduction for another day and focus on classification and regression. Now let s learn a little bit more about our DT algorithm. Note our sample survival is different than our population of 68. fillna https pandas. In this step we will also define our x independent features explanatory predictor etc. At worst it makes completing the project impossible or even worst implements incorrect actionable intelligence. Meaning it s great at predicting data it s already seen but terrible at predicting data it has not seen which is not prediction at all. GridSearchCV and customized sklearn scoring http scikit learn. Possible to validate a model using statistical tests. Previously I used the analogy of asking someone to hand you a Philip screwdriver and they hand you a flathead screwdriver or worst a hammer. 1 Import LibrariesThe following code is written in Python 3. Please Note This Kernel is still being improved. A basic methodology for quantitative data is impute using mean median or mean randomized standard deviation. Giving us an accuracy of 79. We know this is a binary problem because there are only two possible outcomes passengers survived or died. Both are discrete quantitative datatypes. Click here to learn more about parameters vs hyper parameters. Credit sklearn http scikit learn. This leaves opportunity to see how various hyper parameter settings will change the model accuracy. DecisionTreeClassifier we accepted all the function defaults. ETL and web scraping and data cleaning to identify aberrant missing or outlier data points. Step 5 Model DataData Science is a multi disciplinary field between mathematics i. Validate and Implement Data Model After you ve trained your model based on a subset of your data it s time to test your model. discriminant_analysis Data Science 101 How to Choose a Machine Learning Algorithm MLA IMPORTANT When it comes to data modeling the beginner s question is always what is the best machine learning algorithm To this the beginner must learn the No Free Lunch Theorem NFLT http robertmarks. Consequently practical decision tree learning algorithms are based on heuristic algorithms such as the greedy algorithm where locally optimal decisions are made at each node. The Cabin variable is a nominal datatype that can be used in feature engineering for approximate position on ship when the incident occurred and SES from deck levels. Thus they will be excluded from analysis. Unsupervised learning is where you train the model using a training dataset that does not include the correct answer. So check the Change Logs below for updates. Next we use the info and sample function to get a quick and dirty overview of variable datatypes i. Gather the Data John Naisbitt wrote in his 1984 yes 1984 book Megatrends we are drowning in data yet staving for knowledge. Since these variables already exist we ll make use of it to see if title like master makes a difference. This is both good and bad. naive_bayes Nearest Neighbors http scikit learn. If you have a fair coin and you guessed heads or tail then you have a 50 50 chance of guessing correct. In addition we see we may have potential outliers in age and fare. The problem of learning an optimal decision tree is known to be NP complete under several aspects of optimality and even for simple concepts. Chapter 3 Step 1 Define the Problem and Step 2 Gather the Data ch3 1. 24 Da Double Check Cleaned DataNow that we ve cleaned our data let s do a discount da double check 3. Performs well even if its assumptions are somewhat violated by the true model from which the data were generated. Meaning if the majority or 50 or more survived then everybody in our subgroup survived 1 but if 50 or less survived then if everybody in our subgroup died 0. But the question still remains can we do better than our handmade model Before we do let s code what we just wrote above. In sklearn algorithms are called Estimators and implemented in their own classes. One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Also please be sure to upvote fork and comment and I ll continue to develop. We are doing supervised machine learning because we are training our algorithm by presenting it with a set of features and their corresponding target. As a data scientist your strategy should be to outsource developer operations and application plumbing so you have more time to focus on recommendations and design. There are more complex methodologies however before deploying it should be compared to the base model to determine if complexity truly adds value. Prepare Data for Consumption This step is often referred to as data wrangling a required process to turn wild data into manageable data. 0 min_impurity_split None class_weight None presort False We will tune our model using ParameterGrid http scikit learn. For example you won or did not win you passed the test or did not pass the test you were accepted or not accepted and you get the point. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking some groups of people were more likely to survive than others such as women children and the upper class. com watch v EJtTNboTsm8 However in order to tune a model we need to actually understand it. Our model accuracy increases to 81. What does it look like datatype and values what makes it tick independent feature variables s what s its goals in life dependent target variable s. This can be mitigated by training multiple trees in an ensemble learner where the features and samples are randomly sampled with replacement.

This is helpful in a Kaggle Competition or any use case where consistency matters and surprises should be avoided. Reference Cross Validation and Decision Tree Tutorial http www. After all like training a sight seeing dog it s learning from us and not the other way around. With that being said some good research has been done to compare algorithms such as Caruana Niculescu Mizil 2006 https www. Our categorical data imported as objects which makes it difficult for mathematical calculations. 25 Split Training and Testing DataAs mentioned previously the test file provided is really validation data for competition submission. So we will use sklearn function to split the training data in two datasets 75 25 split. io roc curves and auc explained. We can play with our features.

Machine Learning Selection Sklearn Estimator Overview http scikit learn. See algorithms for more information. So let s set 50 as the worst model performance because anything lower than that then why do I need you when I can just flip a coin Okay so with no information about the dataset we can always get 50 with a binary problem. Chapter 10 Tune Model with Feature Selection ch10 1. If you want to follow along on your own download the train dataset and import into Excel. The train dataset has a different distribution than the test validation dataset and population. If you work in research maybe the answer is yes but if you work in business mostly the answer is no. Therefore it is important to deploy descriptive and graphical statistics to look for potential problems patterns classifications correlations and comparisons in the dataset. In order to better align the CV score and Kaggle score and improve the overall accuracy. DecisionTreeClassifier class sklearn. Define the Problem If data science big data machine learning predictive analytics business intelligence or any other buzzword is the solution then what is the problem As the saying goes don t put the cart before the horse. pdf Now that we identified our solution as a supervised learning classification algorithm. This tutorial will give you a 1 2 year head start over your peers by providing a framework that teaches you how to think like a data scientist vs what to think code. Most data scientist come from one of the three fields so they tend to lean towards that discipline.

There are multiple ways to encode categorical variables we will use the sklearn and pandas functions. For data visualization we will use the matplotlib and seaborn library. Thanks and may you have statistically significant luck Table of Contents1. So this step will require advanced knowledge in mathematics. We can narrow our list of choices. org stable modules tree. So we ll stop here for now. In particular we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy. Note however that this module does not support missing values. Data Science 101 Determine a Baseline Accuracy Before we decide how to make our model better let s determine if our model is even worth keeping. Thus it s important to fix before we start modeling because we will compare and contrast several models. For this dataset we will create a title feature to determine if it played a role in survival. ParameterGrid GridSearchCV http scikit learn. The Age and Fare variable are continuous quantitative datatypes. There are many machine learning algorithms however they can be reduced to four categories classification regression clustering or dimensionality reduction depending on your target variable and data modeling goals. It s a small sample size 11 9 but one often used in statistics. The same is true with machine learning. However since there are many null values it does not add value and thus is excluded from analysis. svm Decision Trees http scikit learn. Creating Feature engineering is when we use existing features to create new features to determine if they provide new signals to predict our outcome. With that in mind for iteration two I would spend more time on preprocessing and feature engineering. com machine learning latest dg model fit underfitting vs overfitting. html Choosing Estimator Mind Map http scikit learn.

Question 3B going down the male branch with count 577 Going back to question 2 we know the majority of males died. Please note this is a manual process created by hand. Step 6 Validate and ImplementThe next step is to prepare for submission using the validation data. So we are looking for a feature that identifies a subgroup that majority survived. 11 Model Performance with Cross Validation CV In step 5. A basic methodology for qualitative data is impute using mode. They are also easier to tune discussed in the next section than something like SVC. In this challenge we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. First you must understand that the purpose of machine learning is to solve human problems. Since the dead subgroup is less than 10 we will stop going down this branch. While this topic and big data has been around for decades it is becoming more popular than ever because the barrier to entry is lower for businesses and professionals alike. It s a little more expensive in computer processing but it s important so we don t gain false confidence. 11 Load Data Modelling LibrariesWe will use the popular scikit learn library to develop our machine learning algorithms. The Survived variable is our outcome or dependent variable. org stable tutorial machine_learning_map index. We will use sklearn s train_test_split function http scikit learn.
