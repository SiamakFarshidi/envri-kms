Data Cleaning the Data in csv is raw so we have labelled various parameters1. the ML algorithm were implemented using Kaggle. This means when new data appears then it can be easily classified into a well suite category by using K NN algorithm. The Reason we choose KNN over other Algorithm is simply because it showed way better results than liner regression and many others. Model Building K Nearest Neighbour K Nearest Neighbour is one of the simplest Machine Learning algorithms based on Supervised Learning technique. ALK PHOSPHATE 33 80 120 160 200 25017. K NN algorithm assumes the similarity between the new case data and available cases and put the new case into the category that is most similar to the available categories.

PROTIME 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 9020. In this project The performance is based on the accuracy rate based on which important feature where considered for prediction and the final score of algorithm.

Hepatitis Mortality Rate Prediction Using Machine LearningThe objective of this project is to detect of Hepatitis as well as the prediction of life expectancy of Hepatitis patients.
