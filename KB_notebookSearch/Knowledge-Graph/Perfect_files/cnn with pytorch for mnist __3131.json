Padding to preserve exactly the size of the input image it is useful to add a zero padding on the border of the image. Data loaderSince a CNN needs a image shape as input let s reshape our flatten images to real image to handle matrix and data operation to read csv and handle dataframe data type is long create feature and targets tensor for test set. HistoryContrary to what most people think Neural Networks is quite an old concept. We have 784 250 1 250 100 1 100 10 1 222 360 parameters to train MLP EvaluationConvolutional Neural Network ExplanationTo better understand convolutional neural network I recommend the great section on it here http cs231n. Stride is the number of pixels to pass at a time when sliding the convolutional kernel. For that we need to define a kernel which is a small matrix of size 5 5 for example. Let s see what this dataset is about and how a multi layer perceptron will perform. IntroductionThis notebook aims at discovering Convolutional Neural Network. Later on in 1986 Multi Layer Perceptron MLP was introduced with the backpropagation algorithm in order to train a network with more than 1 layer. By sliding the window along the image we compute the mean or the max of the portion of the image inside the window in case of MeanPooling or MaxPooling. Peceptron is a 1 layer feed forward neural network. And now here we are in the Deep Learning era Multi Layer PerceptronThe first thing to ask is why do we needed Convolutional Neural Network in the first place. Well let s see what happen when we train a Multi Layer Perceptron to recognize hand written digits. data type is long Pytorch train and test sets data loader lr 0. In Machine Learning we have our own Hello World which is the MNIST dataset. However the infrastructure and the algorthm around it was not good enough to allow large scale training. To remember What makes a CNN so interesting for images is that it is invariant by translation and for each convolutional layer we only need to store the kernels. Then Convolutional Neural Network CNN has been introduced in order to learn better features and with the possibility to reduce the number of parameters to be trained. It was first introduced in 1957 under the name perceptron. Thus we can stack a lot of layers to learn deep features without having too much parameters that would make a model untrainnable. The pooling operation need a window size. We will see the theory behind it and an implementation in Pytorch for hand digits classification on MNIST dataset. To perform the convolution operation we just need to slide the kernel along the image horizontally and vertically and do the dot product of the kernel and the small portion of the image. Thanks to this algorithm we are not able to train non linear model which can learn high level abstract features. Pooling the convolutional operation give an output of the same size of the input image. 999 Total correct predictions Pytorch train and test sets data loader.
