An image is made up of pixels. plot its histogram with 256 bins the number of possible values of a pixel. The summary of the notebook 1. The function we will use to face detection is named detect_multi_scale from skimage. Some of those features are used in image processing too. For the Text image we can provide a better loking in its rigth conner. It can be done applying the superpixel segmentation. The histogram equalization is achieved using the equalize_hist function from skmigage. An image may be gray scale or colored. Corner DetectionA corner can be defined as the intersection of two edges. Gray scale images have just a channel with its pixels value ranging from 0 to 255. To do that we use the function threshold_local from skimage. transform as some good functions to make transform images. To filter the noise out we can use the denoise_tv_chambolle function of the skimage. To apply the optimal thresh we can use the Otsu algorithm As we can see by the use of those algorithms the right corner don t show the words as we expected. First extract the face rectangle from the image using the coordinates of the detected Then detect the faces Finally we apply the gaussian filter in each face The EndThank you so much for reading this notebook. I has used this library to create the function show_image. First lets find the contours of an image. More informations about this algorithm can be found at this site Haar Feature based Cascade Classifier for Object Detection https docs. But first we need do this. Blurring faces for privacy protection. The last step is to put back the faces in the original image. This functions is found in the skimage. We can try all those algorithms using the function try_all_threshold from skimage. Thresholding algorithms 4. Noise and DenoisingNoise are common distortions in images. To search for the object in the whole image one can move the search window across the image and check every location using the classifier. Each pixel has a position and a value that refers to its color. Contrast EnhancementEnhance an image can show some features not present in the original data. What is image processing Image processing is to apply of some operations to images like enhance an image extract useful information and analyze it and make decisions. It changes the pixel values and makes some parts of the image more exposed compared to the original image. A corner can also be defined as a point for which there are two dominant and different edge directions in a local neighbourhood of the point. With this function we can chose the number of regions to segment the image. The classifier is designed so that it can be easily resized in order to be able to find the objects of interest at different sizes which is more efficient than resizing the image itself. To solve that problem we have to apply the binariation to regions of the image. Noise e denoising 10. But the value of thresh has to be defined. What is image processing 2. An interest point is a point in an image which has a well defined position and can be robustly detectedCorners can be found by using the function corner_harris and corner_peaks from skimage. We can simulate this noise by applying the random_noise function to the image. We can measure size classify shapes ande also Determine the number of objects by just using the shape of the image. filters ant its function called sobel. We can list some applications for image processing medical image analysis artificial intelligence image restoration and geospatial computing. face car and 0 otherwise. Morphological operationsMorphological operations provide some dilations and erosion on the images. To do this the binarization is a good way. We can enhace an image changing its contrast or doing whats is called histogram equalization. This segmentations is done using unsupervised K means algorithm. One application using some knowledge we that we obtained is to blur faces detected in ah image. To do this some algorithms are present in the skimage library. I hope I helped you understand image processing. After a classifier is trained it can be applied to a region of interest of the same size as used during the training in an input image. There ara some others algorithms to equalize the histogram like adaptive histogram equalization TransformationTransform a image can provide some pre processing tools to better understand informations presents in the image. It can enhancing an image emphasize or remove features smooth an image or detect edges for example. But first lets create a function to show images with better view. Face detection also refers to the psychological process by which humans locate and attend to faces in a visual scene. Create a function to show de detected face We can also detec more than one face Blurring faces for privacy protection. As a first demonstration flip images NumPy also can be used to show the rgb channels of a image NumPy can also show the shape and size of images Histogram with MatplotlibMatplotLib is a famous library from python used to plot graphs and show images. Contrast enhancement 6. Some commun transformations of an image is to rotate rescaling and resize. The first we will see is to import some images. 4 modules objdetect doc cascade_classification. A famous function to find edges is called canny. set a random thresh value define the size of the region to apply the binarization apply the function use the coins image as an example apply the filter you have to specify the multichannel rotate clockwise rescaling by 1 2 of the original image rescaling by 1 2 of the original image the shape of the original image the shape of the rescaled image the shape of the original image the shape of the resized image set a random thresh value import te slic function import te label2rgb function segmentation with 400 regions segmentation with 400 regions A function to show the contour of the image find de coordinates of the corners load the training file initialize the detector cascade. The image above shows the corner as white points. Finding EdgesEdge detection includes a variety of mathematical methods that aim at identifying points in a digital image at which the image brightness changes sharply or more formally has discontinuities. Face detectionFace detection is a computer technology being used in a variety of applications that identifies human faces in digital images. Histogram with Matplotlib 3. FiltersA filter is a mathematical function applied to images. The objective is to show some easy techniques to apply as pre processing to use in images from datasets to train test some Machine Learning models. So to find an object of an unknown size in the image the scan procedure should be done several times at different scales. Finding contours 12. Any problem please talk to me Bye show a image of a rocket the third argument in parenthesis indicates that there are three channels in that image the size of a image is the total count of pixels 427x640 using the red channel of the rocket image. Finding contoursFinding contours of an image is a good way to explore its features. But first lets ma ke a function to compare original images to processed images. To do that we first get the faces presented in an image then apply a filter. Morphology operations 9. The skimage library has some good features we can use to manipulate images. Histograms show the count of each pixel value Thresholding algorithmsHistograms are tipically used to to see the range of pixels values in a image. As an example take a look in the Sobel Filter and its edge detection. Using those pixel values we can threshold then to a limit value To thresh a image is normally called binarization of the image. To see this feature use the gaussian filter function. Other way to denoise an image is to apply the denoise_bilateral function also from skimage. But this library can also show the histogram of a image. Image Processing in PythonThis notebook presents some image processing techniques with python. This technique is widely used to provide a better look in some images. From a colored image we can reach a gray scaled image using color function NumPy on image processingThe NumPy library has some famous features. NumPy on image processing 3. We can now count the numbers showed in the dices. Corner detection 14. A common noise we is te salt and pepper noise. SegmentationImage segmentation is the process of assigning a label to every pixel in an image such that pixels with the same label share certain characteristics. The classifier outputs a 1 if the region is likely to show the object i. We can use filters to smooth an image too. A simple thresholding of an image can provide an segmentation But we can segement an image by more meaningful regions. But we can match those corners and show them. Those operations can be done using the skimage. Apply detector on the image X and Y starting points of the face rectangle The width and height of the face rectangle Extract the detected face X and Y starting points of the face rectangle The width and height of the face rectangle Apply gaussian filter to extracted face Merge this blurry face to our final image and show it. To use that filter we need the library skimage. As an axample take a look in the next image. Colored images have three channels of color one to red oter to blue and other to green the rgb set with its pixels value ranging from 0 to 255 for each channel.
