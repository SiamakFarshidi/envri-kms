The first layer always requires that you specify the input_shape. This is a Dense layer. 6 Create A New ModelCreate a new model called second_fashion_model in the cell below. 0 Check your answer. 2 When you run this command you can watch your model start improving. validation_split 0. You ll now build a model to identify different types of clothing. You can reference the tutorial at this link https www. png Data PreparationThis code is supplied and you don t need to change it. Follow that with a Flatten layer and then a Dense layer with 100 neurons. com dansbecker dropout and strides for larger models which become important as you start using bigger and more powerful models. Add your prediction layer to fashion_model. Don t add layers yet. Just run the cell below. loss categorical_crossentropy 2. 4 Compile Your ModelCompile fashion_model with the compile method. The change could be using a different number of layers different number of convolutions in the layers etc. You will see validation accuracies after each epoch. 2 Add the first layerAdd the first Conv2D layer to fashion_model. The data used to fit the model. solution Your code to compile the model in this cell Check your answer q_4. Have questions or comments Visit the Learn Discussion forum https www. optimizer adam 3. The activation should be softmax or you will have problems later. IntroductionYou ve seen how to build a model from scratch to identify handwritten digits. Add 2 more convolutional Conv2D layers with 20 filters each relu activation and a kernel size of 3. com dansbecker deep learning from scratch. com learn deep learning for computer vision course. We alrady have a variable called num_classes. Keep GoingYou are ready to learn about strides and dropout https www. Set up code checking Your Code Here Check your answer Your code here Check your answer q_2. 3 Add the remaining layers1. We have saved the number of rows and columns to the variables img_rows and img_cols respectively so the input shape in this case is img_rows img_cols 1. As an example your model will take an images like this and identify it as a shoe Imgur https i. The arguments you will use are1. Define the model compile it and fit it in the cell below. See how its validation score compares to that of the original model. com learn forum 161321 to chat with other Learners. To make models that train quickly we ll work with very small low resolution images. Use this variable when specifying the number of nodes in this layer. This notebook is an exercise in the Deep Learning for Computer Vision https www. hint Your code here Check your answer q_3. solution Your code to fit the model here Check your answer Your code below Don t remove this line ensures comptibility with tensorflow 2. 1 Start the modelCreate a Sequential model called fashion_model. Make some changes so it is different than fashion_model that you ve trained above. metrics accuracy 5 Fit The ModelRun the command fashion_model. Look at the first code cell which was supplied to you where we called prep_data to find the variable names for these. First comes the data holding the images and second is the data with the class labels to be predicted. It should have 12 filters a kernel_size of 3 and the relu activation function.
