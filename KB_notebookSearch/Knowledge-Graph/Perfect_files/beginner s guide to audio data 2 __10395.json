In this solution Ridge regression was used to do it please read the above material for more detail. NormalizationNormalization is a crucial preprocessing step. Our 1D Conv model is fairly deep and is trained using Adam Optimizer with a learning rate of 0. Introuction to MFCCAs we have seen in the previous section our Deep Learning models are powerful enough to classify sounds from the raw audio. com zaffnet images master images raw_model. If we want to perform some action after each epoch like shuffle the data or increase the proportion of augmented data we can use the on_epoch_end method. We also generate a submission file. com miscellaneous machine learning guide mel frequency cepstral coefficients mfccs. We use some Keras callbacks to monitor the training. So if the duration of the audio file is 3. community documents workshop2018 proceedings DCASE2018Workshop_Wei_100. This structure guarantees that the network will only train once on each sample per epoch which is not the case with generators. 0001 Training 1D ConvIt is important to convert raw labels to integer indicesHere is the code for 10 fold training We use from sklearn. Ensembling 1D Conv PredictionsNow that we have trained our model it is time average the predictions of X folds. The first model will take the raw audio 1D array as input and the primary operation will be Conv1D2. Ensembling 1D Conv and 2D Conv Predictions Be careful Because we exclude multi labeled records prediction shape became invalid. 1st solution https storage. In other words we should extract features that depend on the content of the audio rather than the nature of the speaker. Freesound Audio Tagging 2019 updated May. com kaggle competitions kaggle 10700 logos header. Ensembling 1D Conv and 2D Conv Predictions 1d_2d_ensembling 1. org wiki Audio_bit_depth with a bit depth https en. png Bit depth 16 The amplitude of each sample in the audio is one of 2 16 65536 possible values. For those interested here is the detailed explanation http practicalcryptography. If you wish to train the bigger model change COMPLETE_RUN True at the beginning of the kernel. com kaggle forum message attachments 365414 9991 Jeong_COCAI_task2. We do not require any complex feature engineering. predictions are saved as following. com c freesound audio tagging discussion 64262 latest 376395 11th solution http dcase. com fizzbuzz beginner s guide to audio data Here I posted the modified kernel for this competition though not perfect. Taking these things into account Davis and Mermelstein came up with MFCC in the 1980 s. We fit the model using DataGenerator for training and validation splits. Change this to True for full dataset and learning To play sound in the notebook Raindrop Using wave library Using scipy Read and Resample the audio Random offset Padding Normalization Other Preprocessing model. org wiki Sampling_ 28signal_processing 29 of 44. There are an abnormal length in the train histogram. community workshop2018 proceedings And more. Once initialized with a batch_size it computes the number of batches in an epoch. The second model will take the MFCCs as input. The __getitem__ method takes an index which is the batch number and returns a batch of the data both X and y after calculating the offset. If we just want to classify some sound we should build features that are speaker independent. png fizzbuzz s awesome kernel from previous competition would be a great introduction for beginners including me https www. The dummy model is just for debugging purpose. It is useful for preprocessing and feeding the data to a Keras model. Building a Model using MFCC 2d_model_building Preparing Data 2d_data Normalization 2d_normalization Training 2D Conv on MFCC 2d_training Ensembling 2D Conv Predictions 2d_ensembling 5. Let s listen to an audio file in our dataset and load it to a numpy arrayLet s plot the audio framesLet s zoom in on first 1000 frames Audio LengthWe shall now analyze the lengths of the audio files in our datasetThe number of categories is large so let s check the frame distributions of top 25 categories. com maxwell110 explore multi labeled data Contents1. It turns out that these techniques are still useful. Before we jump to MFCC let s talk about extracting features from the sound. com 2017 10 17 planet understanding the amazon from space 1st place winners interview Most interesting part for me is the way to consider co occurence. Anything that is global as far as the training is concerned can become the part of Configuration object. For 10 fold CV the number of prediction files should be 10. Also some top solutions in previous competition will help us. Distribution of Categories For simplicity we excluded multi labeled records in train so the number of unique label is 74 80. ModelCheckpoint saves the best weight of our model using validation data. pdf DCASE_2018 proceedings http dcase. We will ensemble these predictions later. com c planet understanding the amazon from space1st place solution had been written in Kaggle blog by bestfitting. 2 seconds the audio will consist of 44100 3. org wikipedia commons thumb b bf Pcm. 1 kHz Each second in the audio consists of 44100 samples. Samplig rate 44. We observe The distribution of audio length across labels is non uniform and has high variance as the previous competition. The __len__ method tells Keras how many batches to draw in each epoch. Generating MFCC using LibrosaThe library librosa has a function to calculate MFCC. org wiki Audio_bit_depth of 16 and a sampling rate https en. We get both training and test predictions and save them as. MFCC mimics the logarithmic perception of loudness and pitch of human auditory system and tries to eliminate speaker dependent characteristics by excluding the fundamental frequency and their harmonics. Exploratory Data Analysis Loading dataDue to multi labeld records in train the number of unique classes is 213 80. We use this weight to make test predictions. The underlying mathematics is quite complicated and we will skip that. During test time only X is returned. Let s compute the MFCC of an audio file and visualize it. Building a Model using Raw WaveWe will build two models 1. Preparing data Normalization Training 2D Conv on MFCC Ensembling 2D Conv Predictions 5. DataGenerator ClassThe DataGenerator class inherits from keras. Any feature that only gives information about the speaker like the pitch of their voice will not be helpful for classification. 1 kHz 16 bit PCM https upload. Some sssential imports ConfigurationThe Configuration object stores those learning parameters that are shared between data generators models and training functions. NOTE This notebook used only curated wav files and did not consider multi labeled records in train. When bulid a valid model we must consider this. One such technique is computing the MFCC Mel Frquency Cepstral Coefficients from the raw audio. We will try Geometric Mean averaging. We will explain MFCC later Keras Model using raw waveOur model has the architecture as follows raw https raw. Let s now analyze the frame length distribution in train and test. 02 Logo https storage. Note Sequence are a safer way to do multiprocessing. Instead of a linear scale our perception system uses a log scale. If we want to double the perceived loudness of a sound we have to put 8 times as much energy into it. But before the Deep Learning era people developed techniques to extract features from audio signals. pdf 4th solution https www.

We observe Majority of the audio files are short. For supplement I have also posted the kernel to explore multi label audio data. EarlyStopping stops the training once validation loss ceases to decrease TensorBoard helps us visualize training and validation loss and accuracy. Building a Model using MFCCWe will build a 2D Convolutional model using MFCC. h5 i Save train predictions Save test predictions Make a submission file Make a submission file Raindrop print fname Random offset Padding Save train predictions Save test predictions Make a submission file Make a submission file.

Also a good feature extraction technique should mimic the human speech perception. The simplest method is rescaling the range of features to scale the range in 0 1. StratifiedKFold for splitting the trainig data into 10 folds. jpg Important Due to the time limit on Kaggle Kernels it is not possible to perform 10 fold training of a large model. Introduction to MFCC intro_mfcc Generating MFCC using Librosa librosa_mfcc 4. Reading Audio FilesThe audios are Pulse code modulated https en. I have trained the model locally and uploaded its output files as a dataset. Planet Understanding the Amazon from Space was a multi labeled image classification competition.
