Now I build my custom dataset and load the training dataNow the dataloaders are ready to be used in the training process. Conclusion Whenever the image had two or more labels I used that as a separate class which I think is not a good idea in the limited training set. In this kernel I try to implement a Chest X Ray classifier by using a pretrained version of DenseNet. max 1 total y. com kaggle docker python For example here s several helpful packages to build Naive classifiero load in linear algebra data processing CSV file I O e. This model was inspired by Rajpurkar et al. So I obtain a list of the names of the scans which will be used for training and validation purposes. This will determine the number of classes which I have used to implement the linear layer of the neural network above. Of course the predicted loss is not real since we stop it after 100 iterations This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed It is defined by the kaggle python docker image https github. Here I try to modify the index of the datasets in order for them to show the full path of the path of the picture files for each set. For example running this by clicking run or pressing Shift Enter will list the files in the input directory Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output. In the train_val_list. I am very new to the field so I am quite open to suggestions and corrections. Same reasoning to obtain the scans which will be part of the test set. I will use torch and torchvision to model my neural network and to take advantage of the ready made optimization functions. txt file the creator of the dataset specifies which of the files will be used for training and validation. I obtain a pandas series with the labels of each set and the name of the picture files as the index. read_csv Input data files are available in the. don t forget to change the output reading from the file stripping away the newline characters getting a view of what my dataset looks like Converting string classes to numbers which can be used as labels for training worst algorithm ever Custom dataset that will be used to load the data into a Dataloader The function that will train the model remove this line in real life remove this line in real life If you want to know the accuracy over the training set uncomment the region below with torch.
