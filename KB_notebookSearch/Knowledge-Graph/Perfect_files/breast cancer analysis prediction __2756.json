Model Evaluation MetricsFor model evaluation and To perform a full ROC analysis let s define two functions Breast Cancer Prediction Feature decomposition using Principal Component Analysis PCA The importance of a feature is computed as the normalized total reduction of the criterion brought by that feature. We can also see that area_worst and perimeter_worst are also quite useful. 9974 If you find this notebook useful would like to hear from you about it. Random Forest Model Prediction without PCA 1. From the graphs we can see that radius_mean perimeter_mean area_mean concavity_mean and concave_points_mean are useful in predicting cancer type due to the distinct grouping between malignant and benign cancer types in these features. Let s evaluate the same algorithms with a standardized copy of the dataset. The first two columns in the dataset store the unique ID numbers of the samples and the corresponding diagnosis M malignant B benign respectively. The precision is 95. Here I use sklearn to scale and transform the data such that each attribute has a mean value of zero and a standard deviation of one. Values closer to zero show less skew. The columns 3 32 contain 30 real value features that have been computed from digitized images of the cell nuclei which can be used to build a model to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant. 9954 Random Forest Model Prediction with PCA 1. It is also known as the Gini importance. The precision is 97. For this we will use the MinMax scalling method. The dataset contains 569 samples of malignant and benign tumor cells. ConclutionUsing PCA I used only 10 components important from the dataset though it contains 30 components However with PCA RF the model slightly outweigh in recall precision and ROC AUC score than that of the previous model. Exploratory Data Analysis EDA Data PreprocessingTransform the M and B values target variable to 1 and 0 respectively. Dataset Description The Breast Cancer datasets is available UCI machine learning repository maintained by the University of California Irvine. Any feedbacks or any future tips for support will be highly appreciated.

Following the encoding of the categorical features we will continue with the normalization scalling of the numerical features.
