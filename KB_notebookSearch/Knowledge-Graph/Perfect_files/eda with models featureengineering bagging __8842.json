Hepatitis DatasetWhat is Hepatitis Hepatitis is a term used to describe inflammation swelling of the liver. PROTIME 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 20. Change DataType Check Info Replace 1 2 values with 0 1 Check Null ValuesHere we can see many null values. DAT file is negative values are quoted because when speaking about the continuous attribute there is no such thing as all possible values. VARICES The liver becomes scarred and the pressure from obstructed blood flow causes veins to expand. SEX male female 4. LIVER BIG no yes 10. High levels of bilirubin can cause jaundice yellowing of the skin and eyes darker urine and lighter colored bowel movements. A normal PT indicates that a normal amount of blood clotting protein is available. Fill Null ValuesIn this data set there are two type of variables i. Check for Null Value Count.

PROTIME The prothrombin time PT is one way of measuring how long it takes blood to form a clot and it is measured in seconds such as 13. Catagorical Columns Numerical Columnswe check skewness by skew of pandas. Importing the Libraries Importing the dataset EDA Drop Column Unnamed 0 Display DatasetNow we can see the column names. Here we can see the Ratio of alive and died. MALAISE A general sense of being unwell often accompanied by fatigue diffuse pain or lack of interest in activities. Draw a Scatter Plot to visualize bilirubin test values with Age and Hue Class Draw a Scatter Plot to visualize alk_phosphate test values with Age and Hue Class Draw a Scatter Plot to visualize sgot test values with Age and Hue Class Draw a Scatter Plot to visualize albumin test values with Age and Hue Class Draw a Scatter Plot to visualize protime test values with Age and Hue Class Plot Pie Chart of histology Column Draw a countplot to show count of people having positive history with Age. SGOT AST or aspartate aminotransferase is one of the two liver enzymes. Class DIE LIVE 2. ANOREXIA An eating disorder causing people to obsess about weight and what they eat. Hepatitis is of 2 types acute and chronic. ANOREXIA no yes 9. Check Information Now by comparing the info and describe of data only the integer data type are visible to us. A group of viruses known as the hepatitis viruses most commonly cause the disease but hepatitis can also be caused by toxic substances notably alcohol certain medications some industrial organic solvents and plants other infections and autoimmune diseases. Now there is no null values present in our data set. SPLEEN PALPABLE no yes 12. SGOT 13 100 200 300 400 500 18. SPIDERS Spider nevus also known as spider angioma or vascular spider is a common benign vascular anomaly that may appear as solitary or multiple lesions. ALBUMIN A low albumin level in patients with hepatitis C can be a sign of cirrhosis advanced liver disease. ASCITES no yes 14. Check Describe As we can we unable to describe all the column of our data set. Plot Pie Chart of liver_big Column Draw Count plot to visualize count of people sufer from liver_big in relation with Age. ALK PHOSPHATE Alkaline phosphatase often shortened to alk phos is an enzyme made in liver cells and bile ducts. Visualization Plot Pie Chart of Class Column. STEROID no yes 5. Plot Pie Chart of anorexia Column Draw Count plot to visualize count of people sufer from anorexia in relation with Age. Plot Pie Chart of ascites Column Draw Count plot to visualize count of people sufer from ascites in relation with Age. It is also known as serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase or SGOT. When liver cells are damaged AST leaks out into the bloodstream and the level of AST in the blood becomes elevated. LIVER FIRM no yes 11. It is an important organ for keeping bodily fluids balanced but it is possible to live without it. ASCITES Ascites is extra fluid in the space between the tissues lining the abdomen and the organs in the abdominal cavity such as the liver spleen stomach.

MORE ABOUT ATTRIBUTES FATIGUE Fatigue is a term used to describe an overall feeling of tiredness or lack of energy. The alk phos level is a common test that is usually included when liver tests are performed as a group. HISTOLOGY no yes About the hepatitis database and BILIRUBIN problem I would like to say the following BILIRUBIN is continuous attribute the number of it s values in the ASDOHEPA. SPIDERS no yes 13. Here skewness is near to symmetri so we can check both mean and median. ANTIVIRALS no yes 6. Plot Pie Chart of malaise Column Draw Count plot to visualize count of people sufer from malaise in relation with Age. LIVER BIG An enlarged liver is one that s bigger than normal. Hepatitis may occur with limited or no symptoms but often leads to jaundice anorexia poor appetite and malaise. Acute hepatitis occurs when it lasts for less than six months and chronic if it persists for longer duration. SPLEEN PALPABLE The spleen is the largest organ in the lymphatic system. VARICES no yes 15. LIVER FIRM The edge of the liver is normally thin and firm. Very low albumin levels can cause symptoms of edema or fluid accumulation in the abdomen called ascites or in the leg called edema. Numericalso to fill null values of catagorical variable we used mode and for numerical variable we used mean or median after checking there skewness. Plot Pie Chart of varices Column Draw Count plot to visualize count of people sufer from varices in relation with Age. Albumin levels can go up and down slightly. lets check info of dataset. Plot Pie Chart of liver_firm Column Draw Count plot to visualize count of people sufer from liver_firm in relation with Age.

Check DescribeHere we can see various parameters such as Mean Standard Deviation Minimum value Maximum value Median and quartiles of the dataset. It can be caused due to viral infection or when liver is exposed to harmful substances such as alcohol. Plot Pie Chart of spiders Column Draw Count plot to visualize count of people sufer from spiders in relation with Age.
