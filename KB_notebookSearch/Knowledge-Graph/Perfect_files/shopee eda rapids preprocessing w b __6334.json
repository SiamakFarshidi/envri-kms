Scanning through multiple shopping websites to get the perfect deal and keeping an eye on upcoming sales is one manual way to go about. Here I ve filtered the table to see only the test images. Logging a dictionary of custom objects Most frequent label groups Least frequent label groups Since the shape of the training dataframe and number of unique titles differ we can infer that we have images with the same title. png Since I have already logged the image embeddings artifact I can directly use it in this manner Here s a snapshot of my project https wandb. finish query W B for an artifact and mark it as input to this run download the artifact s contents converting from BGR to RGB.

It finds the balance between precision and recall. \u2139 Multiple postings might have the exact same image ID but with different titles or vice versa. Posts always self match. log_artifact artifact run. We often find retail companies offering recommendations in which they promote their products in such a way that customers tend to get swayed and pick a similar product that is priced lower. Comparison of any two artifact versions in the table is possible. These matches can be performed automatically with the help of machine learning and that is the goal of this competition. where TP True Positive FP False Positive TN True Negative FN False NegativeImport Libraries I will be integrating W B for visualizations and logging artifacts Shopee Project on W B Dashboard https wandb. png We can even specify filters on any column to limit the visible rows down to only rows that match. init project shopee name image_embedding_val artifact wandb. text Titles with similar text Similar Images Logging the image embeddings as an artifact This helps me to save on time since the model need not be trained over and over again A snapshot of the newly created artifacts https i.
