Question Answering in a single sequence of tokens. This is because as we train a model on a large text corpus our model starts to pick up the deeper and intimate understandings of how the language works. Such a comprehensive embedding scheme contains a lot of useful information for the model. BERT for Dummies step by step tutorial by Michel Kana https towardsdatascience. The classification layer is the only new parameter added and has a dimension of K x H where K is the number of classifier labels and H is the size of the hidden state. BERT_large with 345 million parameters is the largest model of its kind. How BERT works nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp 4. 5 Hyperparameter Tuning6. BERT developers have set a a specific set of rules to represent languages before feeding into the model. And all of this with little fine tuning. It is demonstrably superior on small scale tasks to BERT_base which uses the same architecture with only 110 million parameters. Each word here has a meaning to it and we will encounter that one by one. com max 1200 0 k_fjBnCuByNye4v While it s not clear that all GLUE tasks are very meaningful generic models based on an encoder named Transformer Open GPT BERT and BigBird closed the gap between task dedicated models and human performance and within less than a year. 2 With enough training data more training steps higher accuracy. Most of the text and figures used in this notebooks are taken from the below mentioned resources combining everything into one. 1 Natural Language Inference MNLI and others.

Fourth finally the biggest advantage of BERT is it brought about the ImageNet movement with it and the most impressive aspect of BERT is that we can fine tune it by adding just a couple of additional output layers to create state of the art models for a variety of NLP tasks. com akensert bert base tf2 0 minimalistic posted by akensert https www. There may be two sentences having the same word but their meaning may be completely different based on what comes before or after as we can see here below. A simple binary crossentropy is used as the objective loss function. 1 Sequence Classification Tasks nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp 5. The concept of bidirectionality is the key differentiator between BERT and its predecessor OpenAI GPT. For now the key takeaway from this line is BERT is based on the Transformer architecture. We ve already seen what BERT can do earlier but how does it do it We ll answer this pertinent question in this section. BERT can be used for a wide variety of language tasks while only adding a small layer to the core model 5. In this summary we attempted to describe the main ideas of the paper while not drowning in excessive technical details. http This is a two part Notebook1. Let s see an example to understand what it really means. There are only two new parameters learned during fine tuning a start vector and an end vector with size equal to the hidden shape size. Given a question and a context paragraph the model predicts a start and an end token from the paragraph that most likely answers the question. BERT is bidirectional because its self attention layer performs self attention on both directions. Even if you re a non beginner there might be some elements in this notebook you may be interested in. png Without taking these contexts into consideration it s impossible for machines to truly understand meanings and it may throw out trashy responses time and time again which is not really a good thing. Comprehensive BERT Tutorial 2. That was one of the game changing aspect of BERT. png For starters every input embedding is a combination of 3 embeddings Position Embeddings BERT learns and uses positional embeddings to express the position of words in a sentence. Obtain inputs and targets as well as the indices of the train validation splits 5. A positional embedding is also added to each token to indicate its position in the sequence.

It has caused a stir in the Machine Learning community by presenting state of the art results in a wide variety of NLP tasks including Question Answering SQuAD v1. BERT Fine tuning By Chris McCormick and Nick Ryan https mccormickml. Architecture of BERTBERT is a multi layer bidirectional Transformer encoder. It is ignored in non classification tasks. The vocabulary is initialized with all the individual characters in the language and then the most frequent likely combinations of the existing words in the vocabulary are iteratively added. I decided to wite such a notebook because I didn t find anything quite like this when I started out at NLP Competitions. png For sentence pair tasks the WordPiece tokens of the two sentences are separated by another SEP token. In the above example all the tokens marked as EA belong to sentence A and similarly for EB Token Embeddings These are the embeddings learned for the specific token from the WordPiece token vocabularyFor a given token its input representation is constructed by summing the corresponding token segment and position embeddings. BERT Benchmarks on Question Answering tasks The Standford Question Answering Dataset SQuAD is a collection of 100k crowdsourced question answer pairs Rajpurkar et al. com akensert This kernel does not explore the data. Tokenization BERT uses WordPiece tokenization. Read data and tokenizer Read tokenizer and data as well as defining the maximum sequence length that will be used for the input to Bert maximum is usually 512 tokens 2. Process and submit test predictionsFirst the test predictions are read from the list of lists of histories. png w 389 h 297 Just like sentence pair tasks the question becomes the first sentence and paragraph the second sentence in the input sequence. Callback and will compute and append validation score and validation test predictions respectively after each epoch.
