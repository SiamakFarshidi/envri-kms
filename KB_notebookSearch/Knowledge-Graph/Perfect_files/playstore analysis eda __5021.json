Reviews column i. Replot the data this time with only records with price 0 e. Are there any such records Drop if so. Make a joinplot to understand the effect of size on rating b. for higher Rating their is constant Size. Because in case of Outliers median is the best measure of central tendency. How do you explain the pattern Since on increasing the Price Rating remains almost constant greater than 4. content rating a. There are no such records with rating less than 1 or greater than 5. How do you explain the pattern Generally on increasing Rating Size of App also increases. What s your inference Are lighter apps preferred in all categories Heavier Some Based on analysis its not true that lighter apps are preferred in all categories. What are the top Content Rating values a. Greens color map d. For Higher Price Rating is High and almost constant ie greater than 4 9. What is your overall inference on the effect of price on the ratingGenerally increasing the Prices doesn t have signifcant effect on Higher Rating. rating should be between 1 and 5 as only these values are allowed on the play store. Choose the right metric and plot Task 11. Drop the 3rd record i. their is correlation between Size and Rating. How do you explain this b. But this is not always true ie. Current ver replace with most common value Task 2. Data clean up correcting the data types a. Create 5 buckets 20 records in each based on Size b. By Content Rating vs. If yes drop those as they won t help in the analysis Task 7. Make a heatmap of this i. Price variable remove sign and convert to float c. Make suitable plot ii. Therefore distribution of Rating is more Skewed towards lower values. Do you see any patterns Yes patterns can be observed between Size and Rating ie. Are all 3 records having the same problem Yes all 3 records are having same problem ie all are NaN. Make a jointplot with regression line b. Task 1 Data clean up Missing value treatment a. Size buckets get the rating 20th percentile for each combination c. What pattern do you see Generally on increasing the Price Rating remains almost constant greater than 4. Drop records where rating is missing since rating is our target study variable b. Look at all the numeric interactions together a. rating 3 variables at a time a. Check the null values for the Android Ver column. Convert all other identified columns to numeric Task 3. Replace remaining missing values with the mode c. Make suitable plot to identify outliers in price ii. Make a pairplort with the colulmns Reviews Size Rating Price Task 10. Thus it can be concluded that their is very weak Positive correlation between Rating and Price. record for Life Made WIFI iii. Drop records having a value more than the 95th percentile Data analysis to answer business questions Task 5. Make a bar plot displaying the rating for each content rating b. Because apps with size 40k 60k and 80k 100k have got the highest rating in all cateegories. Identify and handle outliers a. Limit data to apps with 1 Million reviews c. What is the 95th percentile of the installs ii. What is the implication of this on your analysis Since mode median mean the distribution of Rating is Negatively Skewed. Thus we can conclude that their is positive correlation between Size and Rating. So in general we can conclude that heavier apps are preferred in all categories. Limit data to records with price 30 iii. Which all variables need to be brought to numeric types Reviews and installs need to be brought to numeric types. Reviews should not be more than installs as only those who installed can review the app. Yes there are 7 records where Review is greater than Installs. Effect of price on rating a. Are there any values with very few records Adults only 18 and Unrated are values with very few records so we drop them. Installs remove and sign convert to integer d. Does the pattern change Yes On limiting the record with Price 0 the overall pattern changed a slight ie their is very weakly Negative Correlation between Price and Rating. After dropping the useless records make the suitable plot again to identify outliers b. Effect of size on rating a. What is the distribution of ratings like use Seaborn More skewed towards higher lower values a. Which metric would you use Mean Median Some other quantile We must use Median in this case as we are having Outliers in Rating. Do you expect apps on the play store to cost 200 Check out these cases iv.
