We discussed how we can perform EDA techniques such as data loading data wrangling data transformation correlation between variables regression analysis and building classical ML models based on the datasets. Import Required Libraries and Read the Dataset Descriptive Statistics DATA PREPROCESSING EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS FIND CORRELATED COLUMNS Insights From Above Figure Alcohol is positively correlated with the quality of the red wine. Alcohol Vs Quality In above Figure showing some dots outside of the graph. RED WINE QUALITY DATA ANALYSISABOUT DATASETThe Wine Quality dataset contains information about various physicochemical propertiesof wines. Alcohol has a weak positive correlation with the pH value. The label is in the range of 0 to 10. That gives deeper insight into the alcohol column. stats as shown here MODEL DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION HANDLING IMBALANCED DATAEND OF IMPLEMENTATIONCONCLUSIONIn this kernel I have used the Wine Quality dataset provided by UCI to perform EDA. we can see that alcohol distribution is positively skewed with the quality of the red wine. Moreover the regression line is depicted in the figure illustrating the correlation between them. Dist plot of all features create dist plot Import Model libraries transform the dataset classify function train the model cross validation. Most of the outliers as shown in Figure 12. Eachwine has a quality label associated with it. In the nextsection we are going to download and load the dataset into Python and perform an initialanalysis to disclose what is inside it. Quality It indicates the quality of the wine which is ranged from 1 to 10. Citric acid and density have a strong positive correlation with fixed acidity. Density It indicates the density of the wine and is measured in g dm3. Few of them are normally distributed where other are rightly skewed. 7 are around wine with quality 5 and 6. The range of value is between 0 to 14. Check the snippet given here The output verifies that alcohol is positively skewed. Here the higher the value is the better the wine. Citric acid It indicates the amount of citric acid in the wine. FEATURES DESCRIPTION Fixed acidity It indicates the amount of tartaric acid in wine and is measured in g dm3 Volatile acidity It indicates the amount of acetic acid in the wine. The above figures show the distribution of the features. The range of each feature is also not huge. This chemical works as an antioxidant and antimicrobial agent. Sulphates It indicates the amount of potassium sulphate in the wine.

It is measured in g dm3. Alcohol versus pH This Figure shows that alcohol is weakly positively related to the pH values. We can remove the outliers by passing an argument showoutliers False The higher the alcohol concentration is the higher the quality of the wine. We can verify this using the skew method from scipy. It is also measured in g dm3 Free sulfur dioxide It measures the amount of sulfur dioxide SO2 in free form. 0 which indicates very high acidity and 14 indicates basic acidity. It is also measured in g dm3. It is also measured in g dm3 Residual sugar It indicates the amount of sugar left in the wine after the fermentation process is done. It is also measured in g dm3 Total sulfur dioxide It measures the total amount of SO2 in the wine. Alcohol It indicates the alcohol content in the wine. pH has a negative correlation with density fixed acidity citric acid and sulfates. We can quantify the correlation using Pearson regression from scipy.
