{"name": "bioinformatics find codon location ", "full_name": " ", "stargazers_count": 0, "forks_count": 0, "description": "Each codon corresponds to a single amino acid or stop signal and the full set of codons is called the genetic code. DNA and RNA molecules are written in a language of four nucleotides meanwhile the language of proteins includes 20 amino acids. The genetic code includes 64 possible permutations or combinations of three letter nucleotide sequences that can be made from the four nucleotides. 5px line height 2 p style padding 30px color white Bioinformatics python project I am learning python by building simple bioinformatics applications with the online University of California San Diego Bioinformatics Specialization on coursera. com scitable definition codon 155 A codon is a sequence of three DNA or RNA nucleotides that corresponds with a specific amino acid or stop signal during protein synthesis. When codons are read from the nucleotide sequence they are read in succession and do not overlap with one another. The genetic code is described as degenerate or redundant because a single amino acid may be coded for by more than one codon. Substitute any genetic sequences and it will still work From https www. Codons provide the key that allows these two languages to be translated into each other. Of the 64 codons 61 represent amino acids and three are stop signals. div style color white display fill border radius 5px background color 626567 font size 110 font family Verdana letter spacing 1. For example the codon CAG represents the amino acid glutamine and TAA is a stop codon.
