The formula is text log loss frac 1 N sum_ i 1 N sum_ j 1 My_ ij log p_ ij where N is the number of rows in the test set M is the number of class labels text log is the natural logarithm y_ ij is 1 if observation i is in class j and 0 otherwise and p_ ij is the predicted probability that observation i belongs to class j. LibrariesData Description train the training data one product id per row with the associated features feature_ and class label target test the test data you must predict the probability the id belongs to each class sample_submission. Each row in the dataset has been labeled with one true Class.

Tabular Playground Series June 2021 Introduction Problem StatementFor Tabular Playground Series June 2021 we have a synthetic dataset generated using CTGAN and the dataset deals with predicting the category on an eCommerce product given various attributes about the listing. Log a Table to W B then query compare and analyze results in the UI. You can store entire datasets directly in artifacts or use artifact references to point to data in other systems like S3 GCP or your own system. Table is a two dimensional grid of data where each column has a single type of data think of this as a more powerful DataFrame. Initialize a new W B run. Tables support primitive and numeric types as well as nested lists dictionaries and rich media types. MetricSubmissions are evaluated using multi class logarithmic loss. csv a sample submission file in the correct format The train dataset contains 200000 rows and 77 features and test dataset contains 100000 rows and 76 features. Train dataset is twice that of test dataset. Although the features are anonymized they have properties relating to real world features. com dwin183287 tps june 2021 edahttps www. ai guides artifacts W B Tables A W B Table wandb. The columns in the train data are as following id The id of the product one per row features_ The various attribute of the product starting from Feature_0 to Feature_75 target Class labels 0 to 9 The test dataset has same columns except the target value W B Artifacts Use W B Artifacts for dataset versioning model versioning and tracking dependencies and results across machine learning pipelines. Tables are great for storing understanding and sharing any form of data critical to your ML workflow from datasets to model predictions and everything in between. For each row you must submit the predicted probabilities that the product belongs to each class label. Think of an artifact as a versioned folder of data.
