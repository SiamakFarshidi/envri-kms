Balances Fluids Bolsters Immune Health Transports and Stores Nutrients Provides Energy Protein Interactions with DiseaseProteins do not function in isolation it is their interactions with one another and also with other molecules e. gif Cell Structure What do all cells have in common Same chemical makeup Proteins made up of amino acids many are enzymes Nucleic acids DNA RNA Lipids fatty or oily molecules Carbohydrates sugars and starches https s3. jpg Important Functions of Protein in Your Body Growth and Maintenance Causes Biochemical Reactions Digestion Energy production Blood clotting Muscle contraction Acts as a Messenger Provides Structure Maintains Proper pH The balance between acids and bases is measured using the pH scale. gov pmc articles PMC3531279 https slideplayer. org tissue Cell Atlas https www. com slide 5698688 18 images 32 The role of protein interaction in disease. org wiki Protein_structure http paulbrinson. net wp content uploads 2017 03 Cell membrane diagram. In this chapter we will describe the computational approaches to predict and map networks of protein interactions and briefly review the experimental methods to detect protein interactions. It ranges from 0 to 14 with 0 being the most acidic 7 neutral and 14 the most alkaline. org cell Pathology Atlas https www. net store data 008655064_1 388dce9b3c81ae4c6ed884d95c10f722 260x520. Due to their central role in biological function protein interactions also control the mechanisms leading to healthy and diseased states in organisms. More Information https www.

Aim of the CompitionAnalyse the Protein cell from the biomedical image and find the pattern to accelerate the understanding of human cells behaviour and optimise disease such as breast cancer prostate cancer colon cancer diabetes autoimmune diseases ovarian cancer and renal failure. org wiki Human_Protein_Atlas Company Mojor Working with Three Project Tissue Atlas https www. DNA RNA that mediate metabolic and signaling pathways cellular processes and organismal systems. Proteins are polymers specifically polypeptides formed from sequences of amino acids the monomers of the polymer. uk gxa resources images experiment list latest human_protein_atlas. All the data in the knowledge resource is open access to allow scientists both in academia and industry to freely access the data for exploration of the human proteome. Therefore protein interaction networks can elucidate the molecular basis of disease which in turn can inform methods for prevention diagnosis and treatment. org pathology Definition of Protein StructureProtein structure is the three dimensional arrangement of atoms in an amino acid chain molecule. We will describe the application of protein interaction networks as a translational approach to the study of human disease and evaluate the challenges faced by these approaches. Diseases are often caused by mutations affecting the binding interface or leading to biochemically dysfunctional allosteric changes in proteins.
