Dates can show up in your dataset in a few different ways. Notice that pandas is automatically adapting the labels on the x axis to match our output type. Click the Output button on the cell below to see the answers. We can do this to tweak the dataset generating a result that s aggregated by year. There are lots of potential resampling options we ll use Y which is short for year. For example a gym would likely see an increase in attendance at the end of every workday hence exhibiting a periodicity of a day. This is known as autocorrelation. But a period can technically be for any length of time. In the animal outcomes case information is record level the dates are descriptive facts and it doesn t make sense to change them. Does that mean that we can use the tools and techniques familiar to us from earlier sections with time series data as well Of course For example here s a line plot visualizing which birth dates are the most common in the dataset. To put this another way the stock data is aggregated over a certain period of time so changing the time significantly changes the data. Time series data tends to exhibit a behavior called periodicity rises and peaks in the data that are correlated with time. Note that they only work on strong case timeseries data. In an autocorrelation plot the lag is on the x axis and the autocorrelation score is on the y axis. pandas provides a whole dedicated type the pandas. The farther away the autocorrelation is from 0 the greater the influence that records that far away from each other exert on one another. There aren t any significant non random peaks in the dataset so this is good evidence that there isn t much of a time series pattern to the volume of trade activity over time. Time series plotting Optional In all of the sections thus far our visualizations have focused on and used numeric variables either categorical variables which fall into a set of buckets or interval variables which fall into an interval of values. For example in the following dataset of animal shelter outcomes there are two columns datetime and date_of_birth which describe facts about the animal in the observation. But these are the basics and hopefully enough to get you started analyzing your own time dependent data ExercisesTry answering the following questions. It looks like birth dates for the animals in the dataset peak at around 2015 but it s hard to tell for sure because the data is rather noisy. Visualizing by groupingI said earlier that time is a special case of an interval variable. This is because pandas is datetime aware it knows that when we have data points spaced out one year apart from one another we only want to see the years in the labels and nothing else Usually the value of time series data is exposed through this sort of grouping. For example here is what we see when we apply a lag plot to the volume number of trades conducted in the stock data It looks like days when volume is high are somewhat correlated with one another. Period dtype documented here https pandas. Time series variables are really a special case of what other type of variable Why is resampling useful in a data visualization context What is lag What is autocorrelation For the exercises that follow try forking this notebook and replicating the plots that follow. An autocorrelation plot of cryptocurrency crypto trading volume. Much clearer It looks like actually 2014 and 2015 have an almost equal presence in the dataset. A lag plot of cryptocurrency crypto trading volume from the last 250 days hint use tail. A lag plot compares data points from each observation in the dataset against data points from a previous observation. There s an entire literature around how to work with time series variables that we are not discussing here. Time is linear and infinitely fine grained so really time series values are a kind of special case of interval variables. Types of time series variablesTime series variables are populated by values which are specific to a point in time. Here is what an autocorrelation plot looks like when applied to the stock volume data It seems like the volume of trading activity is weakly descendingly correlated with trading volume from the year prior. A good example is the following dataset on stock prices This dataset which is indexed by the date the data being collected is being collected in the period of a day. For daily data like this using a date like this is convenient. In the strong case dates act as an explicit index on your dataset. In this notebook we will explore another type of variable a time series variable. Because timestampls are just interval variables understanding date time data don t require any newfangled visualization techniques Some new plot types Lag plotOne of these plot types is the lag plot. Lag plots are extremely useful because they are a simple way of checking datasets for this kind of periodicity. In the weak case dates act as timestamps they tell us something about when an observation occurred. It does this by computing a summary statistic mdash the correlation score mdash across every possible lag in the dataset. A day of frantic trading does somewhat signal that the next day will also involve frantic trading. The values in the record provide information about that stock within that period. Currently the data is by day but what if we globbed all the dates together into years This is known as resampling. For example here s a similar simple bar chart which looks at the trade volume of the GOOG stock Most of the new stuff to using dates in your visualization comes down to a handful of new data processing techniques. So for example data from December 21st will be compared with data from December 20th which will in turn be compared with data from December 19th and so on. A bar would likely see a bump in sales on Friday exhibiting periodicity over the course of a week. The method for doing this in pandas resample is pretty simple. Of course in this short optional section we re only scratching the surface of what you can do with do with time series data. org pandas docs stable generated pandas. A line chart depicting the datetime column in shelter_outcomes aggregated by year. We ll examine the two most common ways in this notebook. Autocorrelation plotA plot type that takes this concept and goes even further with it is the autocorrelation plot. To see the answers hit the Input button below to un hide the code. This demonstrates the data visualization benefit of resampling by choosing certain periods you can more clearly visualize certain aspects of the dataset.
