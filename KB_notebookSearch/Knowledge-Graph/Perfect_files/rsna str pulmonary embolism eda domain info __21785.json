Intravenous contrast is administered through the patient s veins just prior to obtaining the CT and the CT scan is timed to obtain images when the contrast is primarily in the pulmonary blood vessels. jpg In this image notice how there are filling defects in red color in the pulmonary trunk. Intuitively this makes sense if you have a blockage in the blood vessels in your lungs the right side of your heart has to work a lot harder to try and pump blood through the obstruction. Field Name Feature Type Description StudyInstanceUID UID unique ID for each study exam in the data. Please note that this is a 3D image. Left PE 4 9632 5. How is PE diagnosed Go to TOCThere are various tools for diagnosing PE however current practice relies primarily on CT angiography. What is Pulmonary Embolism PE Go to TOCA pulmonary embolism PE is a blood clot in the blood vessels of the lungs that can be potentially life threatening.

SOPInstanceUID UID unique ID for each image within the study and data pe_present_on_image image level notes whether any form of PE is present on the image. The pulmonary trunk the green annotated part in the image is a major blood vessel that comes from the right side of your heart to supply blood to your lungs. Central PE 5 9632 6. This is because the left ventricle has a much harder job to do pump body throughout the entire body versus just the lungs. However the finding we are looking for is the same filling detects. csv contains rows for each UID label combination that requires a prediction. Table of contentPart 1 Domain Info 9632 1. The proper way to compute RV LV ratio is to find the maximum diameter across all slices. Loading Libraries 10 1. However immediate emergency treatment greatly increases your chances of avoiding permanent lung damage. That giant ball just off center in this image is the heart. qa_motion informational indicates whether radiologists noted an issue with motion in the study. For example In the above calculation we have 650 examination and 146853 images in total.

Submission size calculation for correctness Here among the labels given in the training data pe_present_on_image is the image level feature that needs to be predicted for all the images. org 9632 https prod images static. The maximum diameters of each ventricle are usually on different slices. Now let us have a look at the sample submission file so that we can understand what to predict from all the images. Your right ventricle pumps blood to your lungs your left ventricle pumps blood to the rest of your body. The blockage can be life threatening. InstanceNumber reverse False convert ouside pixel values to air I m using 1000 to be sure that other defaults are captured as well convert to HU. Sometimes the timing of the scan is off resulting in a suboptimal scan. These CT scans consist of hundreds of images that require detailed review to identify clots within the pulmonary arteries. What is Pulmonary Embolism PE 1 9632 2. Patients can have multiple PEs across both lungs hence we have labels for right sided left sided and central PEs but these are not mutually exclusive which means same image can have more than one sided PEs. We see that there are 16 fields in total among them the first three are the identifiers IDs. 0 0028 1051 Window Width DS 400. com download storage v1 b kaggle user content o inbox 2F115173 2Fa2a5ee66b5799274141dd547cc3ea466 2FPE 20figure.

Sequential Read So far we have been able to print the random CT Scan Slices of the patient. jpg Notice how the upper left part right ventricle is much larger than the lower right part left ventricle. Large or multiple blood clots can be fatal. Here one thing should be very clear that one exam has many images. Utility functions 4. In severe cases we may attempt catheter directed thrombolysis. From the documentation we get the follwoing information about the columns of the dataframes. Therefore it has a row for each image for which you will be predicting the existence of a pulmonary embolism within the image and row for each study label that requires a study level prediction. jpeg Note that PEs can occur anywhere in the lung vasculature which is very extensive and resembles a tree. So the total number of rows in the submission file will Here for each of the image we must have to predict the property pe_present_on_image which actually indicates wherther Pulmonary Embolism PE is present in the image. jpg However having a PE can put a big strain on the right side of your heart. Currently CT pulmonary angiography CTPA is the most common type of medical imaging to evaluate patients with suspected PE. Here the first one is the StudyInstanceUID SeriesInstanceUID and SOPInstanceUID are strings and the rest 13 are int64 which are essentially boolian data. Let s have a look at the dataframes. com c rsna str pulmonary embolism detection discussion 182376 by Dr. PEs typically arise from blood clots in the leg veins deep vein thromboses or DVTs that dislodge and become trapped in the pulmonary vasculature. This suggests a more severe PE because the blood clot is forcing your right heart to work harder and causing blood to become backed up into the right ventricle it s just plumbing. jpeg In this image above notice how there are filling defects in the pulmonary trunk. 0 These parameters are must needed for preprocessing the CT Scans. Left PE Go to TOC right PE https pubs. jpg generation 1599575183749576 alt media Test Data FrameNow let s have a look at the test dataframe. RSNA STR Pulmonary EmbolismIf every breath is strained and painful it could be a serious and potentially life threatening condition. csv contains UIDs. qa_contrast informational indicates whether radiologists noted an issue with contrast in the study. This is evidence of a pulmonary embolism in the blood vessel as the blood clot prevents the contrast from filling up the entire vessel. SOPInstanceUID path 16 4. Now we have the images of 512x512 size we can have a look at the distribution of the pixel values. And the rest of the features will be predicted for only the exam. sort key lambda x int x. As the use of imaging continues to grow constraints of radiologists time may contribute to delayed diagnosis. As a title of the images I have set the maximum and minimum value of the pixel which explains why some of the slices are darker than the others. jpg This image shows a single axial slice of a CT pulmonary angiogram CTPA or CTPE at this level of the pulmonary trunk. The following image is a flowchart outlining the relationships between labels.

It can damage part of the lung due to restricted blood flow decrease oxygen levels in the blood and affect other organs as well. jpeg In the image above Acute occlusive pulmonary embolism in a 32 year old woman who presented with chest pain. org images 36787671 60da4496798220ab2a3b52f1978e49_gallery. Note that there are four labels in the training set that are purely informational and require no predictions. A pulmonary embolism PE is caused by an artery blockage in the lung. Chronic PE Go to TOC Not all PEs result in symptoms. If you want to have a in depth look inside reading dicom files you can have a look at its official documentation. In this competition you ll detect and classify PE cases. Here all the images are unique. In addition if the patient is moving a lot or has metal in their body this can cause artifacts which may obscure a clot. How is PE diagnosed 2 9632 3. com redwankarimsony rsna str pulmonary embolism eda data reading and manipulation libraries navigation and directory management libraries data visualization libraries Machine Learning Libraries labels train_df train_df. Lets make a function to read data from the dicom file. Now let s have a look at the actual data itself. CT scan demonstrates a pulmonary embolus that results in an eccentrically positioned partialfilling defect which is surrounded by contrast material and forms acute angles with the arterial wall arrows is left PE5. According to the Mayo Clinic https www. values for path in patient_image_paths labels np. With 60 000 100 000 PE deaths annually in the United States it is among the most fatal cardiovascular diseases. jpg Remember everything is flipped in radiology so the RIGHT SIDE of the body is on the LEFT and vice versa. Because of its importance as a prognostic indicator detecting RV LV ratio 1 in this competition is weighed most heavily across all the other classes. This can result in non diagnostic or equivocal studies. In addition to them there are lot of important information in the dicom file. However just printing and looking at the random slices don t make any sense because they have a particular sequence and they only make sense in that particualr sequence. Central PE Go to TOC central PE https prod images static. We can measure the ratio of diameters of the right ventricle to the left ventricle to see if this is high. Importing Libraries 2. Typically we will use blood thinners either IV or oral. com vaillant 9632 https www. com p pulmonary embolism acute vs chronic. SeriesInstanceUID UID unique ID for each series within the study. But for that whole group we will submit only one set of prediction for those following labels negative_exam_for_pe rv_lv_ratio_gte_1 rv_lv_ratio_lt_1 leftsided_pe chronic_pe rightsided_pe acute_and_chronic_pe central_pe indeterminate Therefore our prediction file should have a number of rows equal to N_ img N_ exams N_ examlevelfeature. Unlike the previous image there are areas in the blood vessels marked in red that are more gray. In particular you ll use chest CTPA images grouped together as studies and your data science skills to enable more accurate identification of PE. It is time consuming to confirm a PE and prone to overdiagnosis. Now we will just have a look at a single exam and will observe if the images are of same patient or different patient. In the above image just the images are printed irrespective of any of the patients. Do some little checks on the pixel array Here among these large number of parameter there are several paramers that a radiologist must have a good understanding of. Rarely surgery may be required. CT scan shows a pulmonary embolus within the posterobasal segment of the right lower lobe artery arrow. Note this is where quality issues can occur. Timely and accurate diagnosis will help these patients receive better care and may also improve outcomes. So the class of this is a CT scan the implementation is dcm4che potentially expanded form DCM for Chest and you have all the standard metadata of a DICOM file for the lungs. The muscular chambers that do most of the pumping are known as the ventricles. org images 17056972 2ef2ae41c8a0b5a070aa21140a14e0_gallery. net publication 233889701_The_Ratio_of_Descending_Aortic_Enhancement_to_Main_Pulmonary_Artery_Enhancement_Measured_on_Pulmonary_CT_Angiography_as_a_Finding_to_Predict_Poor_Outcome_in_Patients_with_Massive_or_Submassive_Pulmona 9632 Acute and Chronic Pulmonary Emboli Angiography CT Correlation https www. Treatment of PE Go to TOCTreatment depends on the severity of the clot. What can we do We can make a nice gif animation and view that. Setting environment pathsFile descriptions in the given dataset is as follows test all test images directory train all train images directory note that your submission kernels will NOT have access to this set of images so you must build your models elsewhere and incorporate them into your submissions sample_submission. 1955 9632 Pulmonary embolism Acute vs Chronic https myradiotraining. Chronic PE 6 9632 7. Treatment of PE 8 9632 9. This type of PE would be a central PE in our dataset it is in the central blood vessel of the lungs. Note how bright the blood vessels are this is due to the intravenous contrast. Sometimes we can see evidence of this on the CT we call this right heart strain. A high ratio is suggestive of right heart strain. png In the meantime check out my other ongoing works in this same competition RSNA STR Pulmonary Embolism Dummy Sub https www. Now in the following part of this notebook we will try to print the scans in a sequence. The artery is enlarged compared with adjacent patent vessels. squeeze labels.
