Once we have constructed the first straightforward projection of the data into graph G_1 let s look into it s statistics Note the difference in numbers we see 1092 links in the dataframe dfL and 969 unique directed links in G_1 The data structure at hand TNGraph directed graph single directed edge between an ordered pair of nodes does not allow for parallel edges. If you have to make plots and experiment with layouts for big networks Gephi might be a good tool of choice. Pay attention to multiple dangling nodes those with zero degree pages that contain a quote and have no outgoing links do not add that much structurally to the model. Tm time when the article post Url was published. aspx L http voices. py is a Python proxy to numerous SNAP functions implemented in C. 6 Kaggle Kernels fast processing of large networks Outline1. Stay tuned The Winter Has Come https habrastorage. In order to do so we shade all nodes that belong elsewhere except for the biggest weakly connected component a set of nodes that would be connected via some path if we view our graph as undirected and a strongly connected component one that considers connectivity through directed edges. net dukenukem images 2 2d Pigcop. Check environment and files Step 1. TNEANet is an alternative data structure that supports multiple attributed edges. Each block of the data has the following structure A B C ClSz number of different phrases in the cluster number of B records. org webt 07 kl va 07klva15cy_pef0gtzooan2x7zi. https habrastorage.

Note the amount of nodes pointing exclusively to themselves these do not add up much to the model as well. There are two types of media these pages belong to blogs encoded as B and mainstream media labeled as M. Or keep those that might correspond to a narrative like these are the links we have established so far. The Ultimate Alien Ass Kicker could take care of them. Subsequent dramatic drop in lipstick sales suggests that the root cause somewhat relates to the phrase you can put lipstick on a pig but it s still a pig Hordes of heavily armed hogs marching city streets only reinforce the first grieve guesses. Problem understandingPhony stuff circulating all over the Make News Media has sparked outrage in an alien civiliation that observed humanity since the very good old times and invasion troops landed on Earth. Luckily data comes preprocessed. py uses two default engines for plotting GraphViz GnuPlotFormer is a part of standard Python environment on Kaggle while latter has to be set up separately enable Internet access in order to do so. 321 https vignette. Let s parse through the text file and pick lines of interest. py on KaggleWe keep installation files downloaded from Snap. UrlTy type of the url B blog M mainstream media. N_n and a hyperlink pointing from a given page N_i to a page N_j results in an edge E_ ij e i j. We have timed records of page publication those with hyperlinks to other pages URLs and they correspond to nodes in a graph that is going to be our model formally Let G_1 denote a directed graph where each web page URL is encoded as a node N_i in N_i. com thefix 2008 09 bristol_palin_is_pregnant. py repository in a dataset Snap. QtStr phrase string. Let s save the data we will return and load it later. They behave in a way similar to Python dicts Let s look into the raw data and build who points to whom network Format files contain the records like this separated by blank lines P http blogs. the Google Algorithm a probability of random walker visiting certain page and highlight top 10 nodes those most likely to get a visit from a web surfer because other well referred pages point to them. Extra mile Some ideas for you to implement and have fun with the given data Remove Suprematist comments from the code above see cells In 15 and In 17 and enjoy faster processing of figures and variability of graph statistics between purges at cost of excluding disconnected nodes and self edges from the model.

Why SNAP Why here Why now 1. Urls number of urls where the phrase appeared number of C records. Let s copy them into the working directory and istall the package in a few steps. 6 on Linux it is a good time to get started here on Kaggle. Run installation script https memegenerator. Next time we are going to look into statistics of graphs their meaning applications and try to answer the question whether or not news propagate on Internet at random. Visualization In 1913 trying desperately to liberate art from the ballast of the representational world I sought refuge in the form of the square. jpg Open Machine Learning Course Aftermath Christmas Run Bonus Packby Vadym Safronov Introduction Getting started with Snap. SNAP comes with multiple hash types for mapping between data types. Reproduce Figure 1 from Meme tracking and the Dynamics of the News Cycle. Implement an alternative mapping for the Make News Media network. NB You can also install Snap. QtId phrase id. find the header line get quotes of the phrase get variant get quote SNAP hash tables to store URL to NodeId mapping iterators for lines total pages of interest outgoing links links to other pages of interest Suprematist comment 1 Suprematist comments 2 and 3.

There is a noticeable pattern that catches eye some nodes form connected components. Let s explore those. QtFq total frequency number of mentions of the phrase. org files fd4 502 43d fd450243dd604b81b9713213a247aa20. Data format Tab separated file with the following nested structure. Refer to the documentation on composite types for the complete list of features. py for network analysis problems participans may encounter while struggling through the curricula beware it is quite broad and that very cross functional nature makes the exercise tough enough. html that capture meme key phrase propagation through media blogs and news sites. com article politicsnews idusn2944356420080901 pagenumber 1 virtualbrandchannel 10112 L http cbn. News network and meme flow So far we have extracted a timestamped list of links between pages that have mentioned the lipstick on a pig in any form. com politicalpunch 2008 09 obama says mc 1. We remove them and get a clearer picture. Let s establish connections between pages. py python setup. On top of that we members of the Open Data Science community have a tradition of going through Stanford classes after each run of the Open Machine Learning Course as a bonus track for survivors keen to focus on something specific. All you need is to add a line from the snippet below to your kernel apt get y install gnuplot qq dev nullKeep in mind that visualzation of a graph containing more than 1000 nodes takes some time. Prior runs celebrated cs231n Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition. Representative phrase from the cluster of phrases. Kasimir MalevichSnap. Now we dive into the Graph Theory and enjoy cs224w Analysis of Networks. Example network exploration news propagation on InternetA. We can color code them Let s identify the most important web pages we will use Page Rank a. py and they appear in the. This is a primer on setting up environment and use of Snap. First we look into keyword clusters phrases mutate and the original quote you can put lipstick on a pig but it s still a pig has multiple variants. The King of the World a.
