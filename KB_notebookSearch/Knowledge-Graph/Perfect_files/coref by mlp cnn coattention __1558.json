For example running this by clicking run or pressing Shift Enter will list the files in the input directory Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output. Features extraction used in this kernel follows Clark and Mannings work https nlp. com kaggle docker python For example here s several helpful packages to load in linear algebra data processing CSV file I O e.

A workaround is to add a very small positive number \u03b5 to the sum. will be re normalized next Cast the mask to floatX to avoid float64 upcasting in theano in some cases especially in the early stages of training the sum may be almost zero and this results in NaN s.
