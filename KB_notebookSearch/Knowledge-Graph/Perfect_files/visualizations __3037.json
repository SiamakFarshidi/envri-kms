Confocal Reflectance confocal microscopy is an in vivo imaging technique with a resolution at near cellular level and some facial benign with a grey world assumption of all training set images in Lab color space before and after manual histogram changes. It seems back lower extremity trunk and upper extremity are heavily compromised regions of skin cancerIt seems that there are larger instances of patients having age from 30 to 60It seems that skin cancer types 0 1 3 and 5 which are Melanocytic nevi dermatofibroma Basal cell carcinoma and Vascular lesions are not much prevalant below the age of 20 years used for converting labels to one hot encoding convert to one hot encoding summarize history for accuracy summarize history for loss Merging images from both folders HAM10000_images_part1. It has 7 different classes of skin cancer which are listed below 1. We will move step by step process to classify 7 classes of cancer. This the HAM10000 Human Against Machine with 10000 training images dataset. Skin cancer is the most common human malignancy is primarily diagnosed visually beginning with an initial clinical screening and followed potentially by dermoscopic analysis a biopsy and histopathological examination. Basal cell carcinoma5. zip into one dictionary This dictionary is useful for displaying more human friendly labels later on Creating New Columns for better readability. 5 years biologists accepted this as evidence of biologic benignity. Histopathology Histo Histopathologic diagnoses of excised lesions have been performed by specialized dermatopathologists. Step 1 importing Essential LibrariesStep 2 Making Dictionary of images and labelsStep 3 Reading Processing dataStep 4 Data CleaningStep 5 EDAPlotting of Technical Validation field ground truth which is dx_type to see the distribution of its 4 categories which are listed below 1. This benchmark dataset can be used for machine learning and for comparisons with human experts. DermatofibromaIn this kernel I will try to detect 7 different classes of skin cancer using Convolution Neural Network with keras tensorflow in backend and then analyse the result to see how the model can be useful in practical scenario. It consists of 10015 dermatoscopicimages which are released as a training set for academic machine learning purposes and are publiclyavailable through the ISIC archive. zip and HAM10000_images_part2. Only nevi but no other benign diagnoses were labeled with this type of ground truth because dermatologists usually do not monitor dermatofibromas seborrheic keratoses or vascular lesions. Benign keratosis like lesions4. They applied the consensus label only if both authors independently gave the same unequivocal benign diagnosis. Follow up If nevi monitored by digital dermatoscopy did not show any changes during 3 follow up visits or 1. Lesions with this type of groundtruth were usually photographed for educational reasons and did not need further follow up or biopsy for confirmation. Automated classification of skin lesions using images is a challenging task owing to the fine grained variability in the appearance of skin lesions.
