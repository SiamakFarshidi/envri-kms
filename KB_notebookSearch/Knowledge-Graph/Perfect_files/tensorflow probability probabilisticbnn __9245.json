AI based algorithms are predominantly being used in financial market trading and data science has huge potential to help improve quantitative researchers ability to forecast an investment s return Goal The goal of this competition is to build a model that forecasts an investment s return rate. Define variational posterior weight distribution as multivariate Gaussian. VariableLayer Simply returns a trainable variable regardless of input. data API is used for building efficient input pipelines which can handle large amounts of data and perform complex data transformations. com uc id 1JYSaIMXuEVBheP15xxuaex 32yzxgglV tf. Dataset can be created using two distinct waysConstructing a dataset using data stored in memory by a data sourceConstructing a dataset from one or more tf. Risks and returns differ based on investment types and other factors affect the stability and volatility of the market. Save model inputs and hyperparameters Create hidden layers with weight uncertainty using the DenseVariational layer. floor area facility type etc weather data for the location of the building e.

Acknowledgements Google supported this work by providing Google Cloud credit Referenceshttps www. csv Random data provided to demonstrate what shape and format of data the API will deliver to your notebook when you submit. The extraction involves the loading of data from different file format and converting it in to tf. investment_id The ID code for an investment. Not all investment have data in all time IDs. The recommended format for the iput data stored in file is TFRecord which can be created using TFRecordDataset. The time IDs are in order but the real time between the time IDs is not constant and will likely be shorter for the final private test set than in the training set. You can learn more about W B artifacts here https docs. ubiquant The image delivery API that will serve the test set. Time series API Details The API serves the data in batches with all of rows for a single time time_id per batch. We set units 2 to learn both the mean and the variance of the Normal distribution. com jalammar intro to data input pipelines with tf data Data source is essential for building any input pipeline and tf. Note that the learnable parameters for this distribution are the means variances and covariances. Use secrets to use API Keys more securely Exploratory Data Analysis Target Distribution Feature Distribution Lets analyze the distribution of first nine features starting from f_0 to f_8 Correlation Heatmap Lets analyze the correlation of first nine features starting from f_0 to f_8 Correlation of Target and Features Lets analyze the correlation of first nine features starting from f_0 to f_8 with the target Preprocessing W B Artifacts An artifact as a versioned folder of data. Event shape describes the shape of a single draw from the distribution it may be dependent across dimensions. data input pipeline consists of three phases namely Extract Transform and Load. Each row in the data corresponds to the a single building observed in a given year. com uc id 1fI0ySFEBL9eUfAJjsta27PEF1neZ6DqZ Fluctuations are common in the financial market irrespective of the investment strategy which has been incoporated. IndependentNormal An independent normal Keras layer. DistributionLambda Keras layer enabling plumbing TFP distributions through Keras models. Dataset is an abstraction introduced by tf. data API and consists of sequence of elements where each element has one or more components. org probability examples A_Tour_of_TensorFlow_Probability TensorFlow Probability is a library for probabilistic reasoning and statistical analysis in TensorFlow and it supports modeling inference and criticism through composition of low level modular components. Multivariate distributions has an event shape of 2. They are also used for tracking dependencies and results across machine learning pipelines. Data The WiDS Datathon 2022 focuses on a prediction task involving roughly 100k observations of building energy usage records collected over 7 years and a number of states within the United States. Image Source https www. IndependentNormal tfp. MultivariateNormalDiag is used to create a multivariate normal with a diagonal covariance. Note that in this example the we prior distribution is not trainable as we fix its parameters. W B Artifacts are used for dataset versioning model versioning. Create a probabilistic\u00e5 output Normal distribution and use the Dense layer to produce the parameters of the distribution. The dataset consists of building characteristics e. com edwardcrookenden eda and lgbm baseline feature imphttps www. example_sample_submission. target The target.

Define the prior weight distribution as Normal of mean 0 and stddev 1. time_id The ID code for the time the data was gathered. from_tensor_slices can be used to construct a dataset from data in memory. f_0 f_299 Anonymized features generated from market data. Artifact references can be used to point to data in other systems like S3 GCP or your own system. DenseVariational Dense layer with random kernel and bias. DistributionLambda and tfp. MultivariateNormalTriL. Investment professionals estimate the overall returns taking in to account the market fluctuations. The different data source formats supported are numpy arrays python generators csv files image TFRecords csv and text files. data API has provisions for handling different data formats. You may need Python 3. layers The layers which will be used in this tutorial are tfp. annual average temperature annual total precipitation etc as well as the energy usage for the building and the given year measured as Site Energy Usage Intensity Site EUI. Entire datasets can be directly stored as artifacts. Batch shape describes independent not identically distributed draws aka a batch of distributions. For example in a tabular data pipeline an element might be a single training example with a pair of tensor components representing the input features and its label tf. 7 and a Linux environment to run the example test set through the API offline without errors. com datafan07 ubiquant market prediction what do we have here https www. com columbia2131 speed up reading csv to pickle Work in progress ignore warnings random sampling to create train and validation data converting training and validation data to csv file Save train data to W B Artifacts Step1 Initialize W B run 2. Your task is to predict the Site EUI for each row given the characteristics of the building and the weather data for the location of the building.
