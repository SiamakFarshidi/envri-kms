This dataset contains 853 images belonging to the 3 classes as well as their bounding boxes in the PASCAL VOC format. png generation 1590132045583855 alt media About The Dataset Masks play a crucial role in protecting the health of individuals against respiratory diseases as is one of the few precautions available for COVID 19 in the absence of immunization. com max 700 1 ICM3jnRB1unY6G5ZRGorfg. com andrewmvd face mask detection for applying Computer Vision based algorithms to detect masks and unmasked faces https www. com face detection with deep learning using multi tasked cascased cnn 8721435531d5 for this implementation help Let us first use a sample image to show the working process of MTCNN Algorithm Architecture https miro. png I have shared a clip that can help you to understand the working of MTCNN algo Sample image is loaded Now let s draw boxes around the region of interest Let s look at some Unmasked images as well Extracting Each face We can demonstrate this by extracting each face and plotting them as separate subplots. com kaggle docker python For example here s several helpful packages to load linear algebra data processing CSV file I O e. read_csv Input data files are available in the read only. The classes are With mask Without mask Mask worn incorrectly. com download storage v1 b kaggle user content o inbox 2F793761 2Fd0744f78b0471c0605b98debd7b2d88d 2FUntitled. Introduction I have used Dataset for Face Masks Detection of Larxel https www. The draw_faces below extracts and plots each detected face in a photograph WORK IN PROGRESS This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed It is defined by the kaggle python Docker image https github. With this dataset it is possible to create a model to detect people wearing masks not wearing them or wearing masks improperly. input directory For example running this by clicking run or pressing Shift Enter will list all files under the input directory You can write up to 5GB to the current directory kaggle working that gets preserved as output when you create a version using Save Run All You can also write temporary files to kaggle temp but they won t be saved outside of the current session creating a detector with default weights load the image plot the image get the context for drawing boxes plot each box get coordinates create the shape draw the box draw the dots on eyes nose. You could just as easily save them to file.
