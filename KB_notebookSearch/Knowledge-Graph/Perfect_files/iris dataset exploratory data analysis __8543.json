The SepalLength and SepalWidth column automatically averages the data but we can do a count or a sum. Each row is an observation also known as sample example instance record 2. One trick you can use to adapt linear regression to nonlinear relationships between variables is to transform the data according to basis functions. We have seen one version of this before in the PolynomialRegression pipeline used in Hyperparameters and Model Validation and Feature Engineering. The target array is usually one dimensional with length n_samples and is generally contained in a NumPy array or Pandas Series. In this case let s use the Species as our index. Suppose If you want to look at just one Species import load_iris function from datasets module save bunch object containing iris dataset and iits attributes print the iris dataset Each row represents the flowers and each column represents the length and width. Notice y is not specified 4. Often dimensionality reduction is used as an aid to visualizing data after all it is much easier to plot data in two dimensions than in four dimensions or higher Principal component analysis PCA which is a fast linear dimensionality reduction technique. Choose the model class 2. For that we will assign a color to each point in the mesh x_min x_max x y_min y_max. neighbors can handle either Numpy arrays or scipy. For this data set this representation makes more sense. It accomplishes this using a simple conception of what the optimal clustering looks like The cluster center is the arithmetic mean of all the points belonging to the cluster. Recall that the Iris data is four dimensional there are four features recorded for each sample. This polynomial projection is useful enough that it is built into Scikit Learn using the PolynomialFeatures transformer How the length and width vary according to the species 1c Scatter Plot with Iris Dataset Relationship between Sepal Length and SepalWidth Method 1 1d Scatter Plot with Iris Dataset Relationship between Petal Length and Petal Width Method 1 Histograpm Plot of Iris Data Violin Plot Now when we train any algorithm the number of features and their correlation plays an important role. Let s try a mean using the numpy mean function and len to get a count. We can use Scikit Learn s LinearRegression estimator to fit this data and construct the best fit line The slope and intercept of the data are contained in the model s fit parameters which in Scikit Learn are always marked by a trailing underscore. K Nearest Neighbours KNN Algorithm sklearn. Transform the data to two dimensions load the dataset. What we probably want to do is look at this by Species and ID. Being a non parametric method it is often successful in classification situations where the decision boundary is very irregular. We will also plot the cluster centers as determined by the k means estimator 1. It includes many techniques for modeling and analyzing several variables when the focus is on the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables or predictors. We could avoid this ugly slicing by using a two dim dataset step size in the mesh Create color maps we create an instance of Neighbours Classifier and fit the data. You can have multiple indexes as well. Despite its simplicity nearest neighbors has been successful in a large number of classification and regression problems including handwritten digits or satellite image scenes. Machine Learning Terminology 1. Thus features selection should be done carefully. The k means algorithm does this automatically and in Scikit Learn uses the typical estimator API Let s visualize the results by plotting the data colored by these labels. The task of dimensionality reduction is to ask whether there is a suitable lower dimensional representation that retains the essential features of the data. It s easy enough to do by changing the index. IRIS Correlation Matrix Supervised learning example Iris classification We would like to evaluate the model on data it has not seen before and so we will split the data into a training set and a testing set. For loop is used for iteration process Plotting the Scatter plot Finding the relationship between Sepal Length and Sepal width Sepal length sepal width Finding the relationship between Petal Length and Petal width Petal length Petal width The arguements specify to return the Fast 5 most among the dataset creating a test data we only take the first two features. Pivot the Data with Iris Dataset The simplest pivot table must have a dataframe and an index. The NaN s are a bit distracting. Plot the decision boundary. For dense matrices a large number of possible distance metrics are supported. Instantiate the model with hyperparameters 3. By eye it is relatively easy to pick out the four clusters. Now what if I want to see some totals margins True does that for us. Supervised neighbors based learning comes in two flavors classification for data with discrete labels and regression for data with continuous labels. neighbors provides functionality for unsupervised and supervised neighbors based learning methods. Features matrix This table layout makes clear that the information can be thought of as a two dimensional numerical array or matrix called the features matrix with shape n_samples n_features Target array. To emphasize that this is an unsupervised algorithm we will leave the labels out of the visualization. Each point is closer to its own cluster center than to other cluster centers. Add Sepal Width to the index list. More specifically regression analysis helps one understand how the typical value of the dependent variable or criterion variable changes when any one of the independent variables is varied while the other independent variables are held fixed. Here the relevant parameters are coef_ and intercept_ Regression In statistical modeling regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships among variables. This could be done by hand but it is more convenient to use the train_test_split utility function With the data arranged we can follow our recipe to predict the labels Finally we can use the accuracy_score utility to see the fraction of predicted labels that match their true value With an accuracy topping 96 we see that even this very naive classification algorithm is effective for this particular dataset K Means Clustering in SciKit Learn with Iris Data k means clustering aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean serving as a prototype of the cluster. aggfunc can take a list of functions. KNeighborsClassifier Algorithm KNN Classifiers Algorithm How it works With Easy explanation Linear regression We will start with the most familiar linear regression a straight line fit to data. print the names of the four features print the integers representing the species of each observation print the encoding scheme for species 0 Setosa 1 Versicolor 2 virginica Check the types of the features and response Check the shape of the features first dimension ROWS ie number of observations second dimensions COLUMNS ie number of features Check the sape of the response single dimension matching the number of observation Extract the values for features and create a list called featuresAll Extract the values for targets Every observation gets appended into the list once it is read. In fact most of the pivot_table args can take multiple values via a list. sparse matrices as input. A straight line fit is a model of the formy ax bwhere a is commonly known as the slope and b is commonly known as the intercept. If there are features and many of the features are highly correlated then training an algorithm with all the featues will reduce the accuracy. In general we will refer to the rows of the matrix as samples and the number of rows as n_samples and the the columns of the matrix as features and the number of columns as n_features. Those two assumptions are the basis of the k means model. In addition to the feature matrix X we also generally work with a label or target array which by convention we will usually call y. Scatter Plot with Iris Dataset 1a Scatter Plot with Iris Dataset Relationship between Sepal Length and Sepal Width Method 1 1b Scatter Plot with Iris Dataset Relationship between Petal Length and Petal Width Method 1 2. Unsupervised nearest neighbors is the foundation of many other learning methods notably manifold learningand spectral clustering. This is interesting but not particularly useful. If we want to remove them we could use fill_value to set them to 0. This dataset has less featues but still we will see the correlation. The k means algorithm searches for a pre determined number of clusters within an unlabeled multidimensional dataset. Put the result into a color plot Plot also the training points Our linear model through the use of 3rd order polynomial basis functions can provide a fit to this non linear data load the dataset import correlation matrix to see parametrs which best correlate each other According to the correlation matrix results Petal LengthCm and PetalWidthCm have positive correlation which is proved by the scatter plot discussed above I prefer to use train_test_split for cross validation This piece will prove us if we have overfitting Train and test model First let s generate a two dimensional dataset containing four distinct blobs. The idea is to take our multidimensional linear model y a0 a1x1 a2x2 a3x3 and build the x_1 x_2 x_3 and so on from our single dimensional input x. Loading the Iris dataset from Scikit learn Data as table A basic table is a two dimensional grid of data in which the rows represent individual elements of the dataset and the columns represent quantities related to each of these elements. The classes in sklearn. Each column is a feature also known as Predictor attribute Independent Variable input regressor Covariate Each value we are predicting is the response also known as target outcome label dependent variable Classification is supervised learning in which the response is categorical Regression is supervised learning in which the response is ordered and continuous Requirements for working with data in scikit learn 1 Features and response are separate objects 2 Features and response should be numeric 3 Features and response should be NumPy arrays 4 Features and response should have specific shapes 1. Unsupervised learning example Iris dimensionality As an example of an unsupervised learning problem let s take a look at reducing the dimensionality of the Iris data so as to more easily visualize it.
