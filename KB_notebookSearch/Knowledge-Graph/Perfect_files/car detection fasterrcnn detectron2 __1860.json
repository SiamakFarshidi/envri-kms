XYXY_ABS doesn t work loading normal from JSON Register datasets with Detectron2 Create dataset name strings Register the datasets with Detectron2 s DatasetCatalog which has space for a lambda function to preprocess it Create the metadata for our dataset the main thing being the classnames we re using Setup metadata variable to set the figure size revervse the image pixel order BGR RGB use the metadata variable we created about Setup a model config recipe for training a Detectron2 model Add some basic instructions for the Detectron2 model from the model_zoo https github. After getting the annotions I translated them into detectron2 s desired format. Dataset As for dataset I widely search the internet and found a good video inlcuding desired objects to detect. Datafiles d2 deneme train. All images files. DefaultTrainer Resume training from model checkpoint or not we re going to just load the model in the config https detectron2. Air devices like helicopters and quadcopters may need an object detector to detect humans and cars along their way. Installing the Detectron2 Import the libraries Step 1 Register Dataset To Detectron2 Having the annotion files and images is not enought for detectron2. Step 4 Observe Results a series of pre trained Detectron2 models https github. Notebook Object Detection FasterRCNN Detectron2 This project goes trough a FasterRCNN implementation for detecting cars and pedestrians from a drone footage. json This file contains all annotions of the validation image dataset. So in this project car and human detection will be center of the project. With so many applications of object detection like Face detection object detection keypoint detection etc. Then uploaded my frames to roboflow to annote and preprocces. So I splited the video to its frames. Select random three pictures from dataset and display them Step 2 Configure The Cfg File Step3 Create Enviroment For Testing Can be used If brightness needed to be adjust. How many iterations are we going for 300 is okay for our small model increase for larger datasets ROI region of interest as in how many parts of an image are interesting how many of these are we going to find Setup output directory all the model artefacts will get stored here in a folder called outputs Setup the default Detectron2 trainer see https detectron2. We do the same calculation with the learning rate as the GPUs the original model used 0. com facebookresearch detectron2 blob master MODEL_ZOO. resume_or_load Start training Get the final model weights from the outputs directory Set the testing threshold a value between 0 and 1 higher makes it more difficult for a prediction to be made Tell the config what the test dataset is we ve already done this Setup a default predictor from Detectron2 https detectron2. 01 so we ll divide by 8 0. To correctly classify desired objects Facebooks Detectron2 did an amazing job to make programmers implement complicated computer vision algorithms easily. md a default predictor class to make predictions on an image using a trained model a config of cfg in Detectron2 is a series of instructions for building a model a class to help visualize Detectron2 predictions on an image stores information about the model such as what the training test data is what the class names are Get absolute path of JSON label file Check to see if json_file exists Convert bbox_mode to Enum of BoxMode. DefaultPredictor select random samples from the validation set to set the figure size. Open and transform json annotion files. 0 Setup datasets to train validate on this will only work if the datasets are registered with DatasetCatalog How many dataloaders to use This is the number of CPUs to load the data into Detectron2 Colab has 2 so we ll use 2 How many images per batch The original models were trained on 8 GPUs with 16 images per batch since we have 1 GPU 16 8 2. com facebookresearch detectron2 Lets Begin Object detection is getting more and more popular over the years. Inorder to use annotions json files must be registered to the DatasetCatalog object along with the images.
