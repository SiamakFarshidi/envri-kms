FUNCTIONS Reference Human Protein Atlas Segmentation https www. get rgby images for sample blend rgby images into single array Create PIL Image Introduce list of image filters Returns a processed image ready for the CNN and an encoded label as tensor Let s check out the label distribution frequency. We should be able to train an image classification model to identify each cell within the image. Processing the data for training. The main problem is that the labels are given for each image therefore we don t really know which of the cells in the image may represent such label. Segmentation using HPA Cell Segmentation https github. It s an ugly plot but I m trying to save some time here. arrays Get single image that blends all RGBY into RGB Introduce the images as arrays. com ayuraj hpa multi label classification with tf and w b Imports. We ll put aside the yellow filter for now. com CellProfiling HPA Cell Segmentation Visualizing the masks Let s check the results of the segmentation Cell separation The objective of this project is to label each cell in the image. TRAINING MODEL SETUP Reference HPA Multi Label Classification with TF and W B https www. Parameter setting Training data Validation data CNN Model Input list of image filters as png Output list of image filters as np. Therefor we can only pass a 3 filter image. Therefore each cell in the image must be separated. Maybe the CNN is able to understand the pattern given the same label for every cell of the image although it can lead to high misslabeling. Nuclei segmentation Cell segmentation Nuclei mask Cell masks Plotting Let s stack the original image and the segmentation mask to see how the segmentation worked out Unique vector of cell_mask numbers We ll use EfficientNetB0 model which requires an image dimension of 224 224 3. Can use the function above.
