Model designing and training 4. G gold standard P prediction By adding alpha we can see the density of the scattered spots clearly. To do further computation we have to replace with NaN and turn the object type to numeric type. Defining features and labels Data normalizationNow we are ready to run keras model. It s also my first kernal written on Kaggle. Num of pregnancies Cytology Schiller See the correlation between the elements df Fastest way to get contour of the dataThe correlation was actually quite low. Data preprocessingNow It s time to fill all the NaN values. For continuous variable we fill the median value. Model accuracy test 1. THX for the suggestion in comment For categorical variable we fill 1. Data pre processing 3. Model prediction accuracy In test dataSee what s going wrong Confusion matrixMake confusion matrix to evaluate the performance of the prediction model. Quick check for value range especially when doing regression Shuffle the data and split them into train set and test set. This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed It is defined by the kaggle python docker image https github. For example running this by clicking run or pressing Shift Enter will list the files in the input directory Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output. If we want to purely let machine learn by itself then we should not look too deeply into the data in case the bias made by human intelligence. com kaggle docker python For example here s several helpful packages to load in linear algebra data processing CSV file I O e. Data observationHere our observation means to see the type and structure of the data or whether there are missing values. Let s import the dataIt seems there are some missing values named as and made the whole column become an object. for continuous variable Under suggestion Under suggestion for categorical variable No null left making temporary save Make sure if it s the shape what we want Input layer Hidden layer 1 Output layer for showing the structure and parameters Defining how to measure performance Train the model Verbose 2 showing loss and accuracy change timely visualize the loss and accuracy after each epoch For saving weights Answer sheet Create a dataframe for prediction and correct answer Gold standard diagnostic tool our prediction Making x label be on top is common in textbooks. The result matched the common sense of the medical knowldege High specificity diagnositic tool would have low false positive error. Calculating sensitivity specificity false_positive_rate and false_negative_rateYou can also do the same analysis with train data. hahaSo if you have any comments or questions for me feel free to leave a message Outline of practicing machine learning 1. We are ready for spliting data into train test set defining features and labels and normalization. Now we have full data df for computation. Try it Appendix Dealing with original data Human learning Let s see some categorical variable property Age Number of sexual partnersThe people having more than 10 sexual partners got biopsy. The reason I don t want to train this model too many times is because the training set and validation set loss seems to deviate which is a sign of overfitting. List the heatmap of top correlation Conclusion It seems that Schiller_1 Hinselmann_1 and cytology_1 had the highest correlation with biopsy. read_csv Input data files are available in the. By adding alpha we can see the density of the scattered spots clearly. categorical to categorical continuous to categorical continuous to categorical Hard do see anything. Keras Model designing training visualization A very simple quick and effective MLP approach to solve binary classification problem The model should run very fast because the data was really small. Data observation 2. This is a beginner s guide for using Keras MLP approach to build simple data analyis model. check NaN counts in different columns making temporary save turn data into numeric type for computation Now it s all numeric type and we are ready for computation and fill NaN.
