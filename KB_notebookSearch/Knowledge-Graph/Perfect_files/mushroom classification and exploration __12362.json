If stalk_surface_below_ring is silky k mushrooms are mostly poisonous with 93 rate 2160 sample. I step up the accuracy to 95. Hold the df_color feature names in list. KNN With K Fold Cross Validation SVM Support Vector Machine Confusion Matrix of SVM SVM With K Fold Cross Validation SVM With Grid Search Cross Validation I removed the below code because it take a long time during running. gill_color is brown n 89 936 sample or purple u 90 444 sample mushrooms are mostly edible. I used LabelEncoder method to transform non numerical labels to numerical labels. Histogram is about frequency of data with visualization. According to these attributes it was found out which factors are effective on whether the mushroom is poisonous or not. count Counts of values in each features descending from ascending. All of features are non null object so I have not missing values for this dataset. 0001 svm SVC svm_cv GridSearchCV svm grid cv 10 svm_cv. But I detected best parameter values with this code. fit x_train y_train print tuned hyperparameters best parameters rf_cv. But if I calculate detailed I write below codes. best_params_ print accuracy lr_cv. Preparer RUNLIYIn this research it is tried to learn which features are mostly indicative of a poisonous mushroom and what types of machine learning models perform best on this dataset. corr method uses to show the correlation between the values. In all values of population if odor is 5 none and population isn t 1 clustered or 4 several mushrooms are edible. The data contains attributes are class cap shape cap surface cap color bruises odor gill attachment gill spacing gill size gill color stalk shape stalk root stalk surface above ring stalk surface below ring stalk color above ring stalk color below ring veil type veil color ring number ring type spore print color population habitat. model_selection import GridSearchCV grid C np. Describe method is useful now because of the label encoder. gill_color is buff b colored mushrooms are exactly poisonous 1728 sample.

I calculated poisonous mushroom ratio according to cap shapes. Because I will use in visualizations with for loops. Mushroom analysing according to only odor types I calculated poisonous mushroom ratio according to odors. model_selection import GridSearchCVgrid n_estimators 100 300 500 criterion gini entropy bootstrap True False rf RandomForestClassifier rf_cv GridSearchCV rf grid cv 10 rf_cv. Converting Object Types Into Integer Types and Label Encoder I need numeric values for thoroughly analyze my data but all features are in object form. Two comment code cells in below comment row because I don t want take up a lot of space in my kernel I learnt counts of values in each features and counts of poisonous and edible mushrooms in each features. So I will apply K Fold Cross Validation to avoid overfitting. get_dummies I used this method to convert all values into 1 and 0. For example above histogram 4 musty odor type count s is too few but below it seem 100 poisonous. The freq is the most common value s frequency. Because I try to find next mushroom is poisonous or edible and I ll show step by step. Hold the feature names in list. If stalk_color_above_ring and stalk_color_below_ring are gray g colored muhrooms are completely edible. axis 0 represents rows and axis 1 represents columns. So I changed with m_class that s mean mushroom classReview dataset. The Mushroom s dataset contains 8124 mushrooms both edible and poisonous in several species. I found variety of values in features And I noticed that all mushrooms have the same veil type which is p partial none of them are u universal. 576 sample If stalk_color_above_ring and stalk_color_below_ring are buff b colored mushrooms are completely poisonous 432 sample Inferences If ring_type is large l mushrooms are poisonous with 1296 samples. I create new dataframe that includes only color features in df. Counts of poisonous and edible mushrooms in each features. Inferences If bruises t true mushrooms are edible overwhelmingly 82 edible Mushrooms have almond a and anise l odors are completely edible with 400 sample Mushrooms that hasn t an odor n are mostly edible Only 3 are poisonous Foul f 2160 fishy y 576 spicy s 576 creosote c 192 odor types completely poisonous. best_score_ Output tuned hyperparameters best parameters bootstrap True criterion gini n_estimators 100 accuracy 1. Feature names had seperated with hyphen this situation cause some syntax error later so I changed hyphen with underscore _ below code line. fit x_train y_train print tuned hyperparameters best parameters svm_cv.

It isn t necessary sometimes it makes easier normalization but I prefer different method instead of this. 33699013 second component 0. And after this code cells I visualized them to be understandable usually six by six. fit_transform Fit label encoder and return encoded labelsChecking the values.

I don t need to use columns dtypes isnull and shape methods because info method already contains all of them. number of poisonous mushroom in every odor types. So we can not generalize.

Confusion Matrix of Logistic Regression With Grid Search Cross Validation For logistic regression above codes enough. I want to stop Pandas showing Future Warning messages again and again so used import warnings Logistic Regression With Grid Search Cross Validation I run below code before and found the best C and penalty values but I removed the code because it take a long time during running. plot kind hist bins 20 figsize 5 5 color red grid True plt. I compared unique values between with label encoder and without label encoder in columns to make interpretation easy. 90 the correlation is positively correlated. Let s look at our data what percentage of mushrooms are poisonous p and what percentage of mushrooms are edible e. And class is a keyword in python if I don t change it it will cause some problems. After that time my works will be easier. for i in df print df i. 6 percent difference equal to 292 sample. I can say that if there isn t bruises 0 and odor is not anise 3 or pungent 6 mushrooms are mostly poisonous. 0 Random Forest Classification With Grid Search Cross Validation and K Fold PCA PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS principle component 0. And following visualize them. So I can drop this feature it is unnecessary. And some classification models used to categorize the mushroom type is edible or poisonous to identify the class to which a new data will fall under.
