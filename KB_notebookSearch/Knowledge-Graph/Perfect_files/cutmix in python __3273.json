The parameter lambda that determines the size of the bounding box is stochastically sampled from a Beta distribution https en. In general the bacth loaded by a dataloader also includes a batch of image labels if we are solving a classification problem. The label of each resultant augmented image is estimated as a weighted sum of the original label and the label of the image from which the modified patch is borrowed where weights are lambda and 1 lambda respectively. png attachment image. The paper also shows that CutMix improves the model robustness against input corruptions and its out of distribution detection performances. A CutMix Image GenerationIn CutMix algorithm for each image of batch a random region in our case a random bounding box region is replaced with a patch from another training image. Let s assume that this batch is a minibacth generated by a dataloader that loads minibatches during the training of the deep neural network model. Loading DataTo show the result of CutMix augmentation we will use a set of images containing images of wheat field showing wheat heads. edu shervine blog pytorch how to generate data parallel to learn more about dataloaders in PyTorch. org stable modules generated sklearn.

Improving Classification and Object Detection using CutMix Augmentation Supplementary to my medium article https medium. com ZenFeather cutmix augmentation in python bf099a97afac The paper CutMix Regularization Strategy to Train Strong Classifiers with Localizable Features published in ICCV 2019 proposed the CutMix augmentation strategy to improve deep learning based classification and localization tasks. We will randomly assign a label to each image from from the set of 0 1 2. By making efficient use of training pixels and retaining the regularization effect of regional dropout CutMix consistently outperformed the state of the art augmentation strategies on CIFAR and ImageNet classification tasks as well as on the ImageNet weakly supervised localization task. Please follow this https stanford. Generating a Batch of DataNow we will create a set or batch of 4 images. In the following table we can see the performance boost obtained by adopting CutMix augmentation. com clovaai CutMix PyTorch Import glob to parse filenames Import numpy Plot Opencv Path to data Read filenames in the data folder Read first 10 filenames Display a sample image Create batch of 4 images label_temp 2 Convert image_batch to numpy array Conver image_batch_labels to numpy array Print labels Show images uniform Read an image Crop a random bounding box Draw bounding box on the image Show cropped image generate mixed sample adjust lambda to exactly match pixel ratio Generate CutMix image Let s use the first image of the batch as the input image to be augmented Show original images Show CutMix images Print labels. We will further one hot encode https scikit learn. These images are takes from Kaggle s Glbal Wheat Detection competition dataset. Now you can use CutMix augmentation in training you deep neural network model. In this augmentation technique patches are cut and pasted among training images where interestingly the ground truth labels are also mixed proportionally to the area of the patches.
