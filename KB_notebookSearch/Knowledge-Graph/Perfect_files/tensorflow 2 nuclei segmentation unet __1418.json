Get the data Downsample both the training and test images to reduce computations Retain record of the original sizes of the test images to upsample predicted masks and create correct run length encodings Visualize imported data Build and train our neural networkNext we build our U Net model loosely based on U Net Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation https arxiv. com rakhlin fast run length encoding python has an excellent implementation of run length encoding. Iterate over the test IDs and generate run length encodings for each seperate mask identified by skimage. 04597 which is very common for image segmentation problems such as this.
