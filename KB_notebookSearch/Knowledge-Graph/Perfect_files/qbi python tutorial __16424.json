Convex HullTo get started let s load an image using io. Watershed segmentationThe watershed is a classical algorithm used for segmentation thatis for separating different objects in an image. The final result is knownas the h dome of an image since this tends to isolate regional maxima ofheight h. The structuring element selem passed to erosion is a boolean array that describes thisneighborhood. PythonThere are two major versions of Python 2 and 3. The size dependence ishighlighted by the outer white ring The parts of the ring thinner than thestructuring element were completely erased while the thicker region at thetop retains its original thickness. This operation returns the dark spots of theimage that are smaller than the structuring element. The package includes some test images to make getting started a bit easier Controlling FiguresWe see the figure looks fine but if we want to give it a title and turn off the axes we need to learn a bit more about the plot settings ThresholdingThresholding is used to create a binary image from a grayscale image 1 _. Opening Morphological opening on an image is defined as an erosion followed bya dilation. The algorithm floodsbasins from the markers until basins attributed to different markersmeet on watershed lines. Generate noisy image of a square Compute the Canny filter for two values of sigma display results Convert to float Important for subtraction later which won t work with uint8 Construct some test data Find contours at a constant value of 0. Closing Morphological closing on an image is defined as a dilation followed byan erosion. Also notice the decrease in size of the twoblack ellipses in the centre and the thickening of the light grey circlein the center and the 3 patches in the lower part of the image. Closing can remove small dark spots i. See Wikipedia_ for more details on the algorithm. To get a feel for the reconstruction process we plot the intensity of themask seed and dilated images along a slice of the image indicated by redline. As you can see in the image slice each coin is given a different baselineintensity in the reconstructed image this is because we used the localintensity shifted by h as a seed value. As a result the coins in thesubtracted image have similar pixel intensities. Reconstruction AlgorithmsHere is a brief introduction to reconstruction algorithms. Here we start with a python notebook. Notice how the white boundary of the image thickens or gets dilated as weincrease the size of the disk. the minima of theopposite of the distance are chosen as markers and the flooding ofbasins from such markers separates the two circles along a watershedline. To enable computed tomography reconstruction of the object several projectionsmust be acquired each of them corresponding to a different angle between therays with respect to the object. A projection isformed by drawing a set of parallel rays through the 2D object of interest assigning the integral of the object s contrast along each ray to a singlepixel in the projection. The dilationoperation that follows ensures that dark regions that are larger than thestructuring element retain their original size. Here the seed image is the original image minus a fixed value h. In any given technique we probe an image with a small shape ortemplate called a structuring element which defines the region of interest orneighborhood around a pixel. org wiki Otsu s_methodIf you are not familiar with the details of the different algorithms and theunderlying assumptions it is often difficult to know which algorithm will givethe best results. In this document we outline the following basic morphological operations 1. Finally edge pixels are kept or removed using hysteresisthresholding on the gradient magnitude. 2 Wikipedia Radon transform http en. The ones relevant for us are subplot and imshow since that was a really boring histogram we can make a normal distribution with 1000 points get the camera image from the scikit image data we use a grayscale ma make a new subplot figure with 2 axes we can use a different color mapping scheme like jet matlab s default turn off the axes lines you can also specifiy color maps by name change the aspect ratio to 2 1 show a color bar for the second image only Here we specify a radius for local thresholding algorithms. To make things interesting we ll add bright and dark spots to the image As you can see the 10 pixel wide white square is highlighted since it issmaller than the structuring element. The inverse Radon transform is used in computed tomography to reconstructa 2D image from the measured projections the sinogram. We can attempt to correct this using a different seedimage. Subtracting the dilated image leaves an image with just the coins and aflat black background as shown below. To illustrate this more clearly let s add a small crack to the whiteborder Since closing an image starts with an dilation operation dark regionsthat are smaller than the structuring element are removed. For further information on tomographic reconstruction see. Using markers on the lower values will ensure that the segmented objects arefound. The very first lines of a python script or notebook need to be the ___future___ commands since they change they way the rest of the lines are interpreted. The marching squares algorithm __ is a special case ofthe marching cubes algorithm Lorensen William and Harvey E. Also the thin white edges aroundmost of the ellipse are retained because they re smaller than thestructuring element but the thicker region at the top disappears. Note that morphologyfunctions only work on gray scale or binary images so we set as_grey True. A collection of projections at several anglesis called a sinogram which is a linear transform of the original image. MarchingCubes A High Resolution 3D Surface Construction Algorithm. It uses Fourier transform of the projection andinterpolation in Fourier space to obtain the 2D Fourier transform of theimage which is then inverted to form the reconstructed image. Morphological FilteringMorphological image processing is a collection of non linear operations relatedto the shape or morphology of features in an image such as boundaries skeletons etc. It is built to resemble to plotting tools in Matlab hence the name. Then potentialedges are thinned down to 1 pixel curves by removing non maximum pixels of thegradient magnitude. Radon transformIn computed tomography the tomography reconstruction problem is to obtaina tomographic slice image from a set of projections 1 _. make a 3 3 array with ones in every position create a vector from 0 to 24 shape the array into a 5x5 matrix instead of a vector each numpy array has a property called shape which gives you the dimensions we can now show all the functions in plt by using the dir command. This script performs the Radon transform to simulate a tomography experimentand reconstructs the input image based on the resulting sinogram formed bythe simulation. They are just for use inside of jupyter notebooks. Contours which intersectthe image edge are open all others are closed. We want to make sure that we show the image with this set to none Show an imageHere we start to use the scikit image _skimage_ package. Since opening an image starts with an erosion operation light regionsthat are smaller than the structuring element are removed. Canny edge detectorThe Canny filter is a multi stage edge detector. Black tophat The black_tophat of an image is defined as its morphological closingminus the original image. While most projects and new developers are using 3 a number of tooboxes still have not been converted and even a few major players like Google and Kitware Slicer Paraview are still using version 2. A practical exactimplementation of the inverse Radon transform does not exist but there areseveral good approximate algorithms available. The lines will be ignored in python 3. Starting from user defined markers the watershed algorithm treatspixels values as a local topography elevation. As a rule of thumb the number of projections should be about thesame as the number of pixels there are across the object to see why thisis so consider how many unknown pixel values must be determined in thereconstruction process and compare this to the number of measurementsprovided by the projections and we follow that rule here. The future commands are very important because they cause python 2 to behave more like python 3. This operation returns the bright spots of theimage that are smaller than the structuring element. Commands that start with a are not normal python and are so called _magic_ commands. It has a high degree of similiarity to Matlab. skimage provides afew different options for the filter. 1 AC Kak M Slaney Principles of Computerized Tomographic Imaging IEEE Press 1988. org wiki Thresholding_ 28image_processing 29. If it is turned off 3 40 if it is turned on from __future__ import division 3 40. 75 NumpyNumpy is a package for efficiently dealing with vector and matrix data. If it is not specified only global algorithms are called. Also notice how the crack we added ismostly removed. Another very useful magic command is time to show how long a time took to execute HistogramWe can also make a histogram using matplotlib using the hist function. Typically we will load the pyplot sub package and abbreviate it as plt this is done by a modified import command Notes and MagicThe matplotlib inline command is for use inside of Jupyter notebooks to show the figures in the notebook instead of opening a new figure window the default when using python from the command line. In the example below two overlapping circles are to be separated. Dilation enlarges brightregions and shrinks dark regions. Weinitialize a seed image to the minimum intensity of the image and set itsborder to be the pixel values in the original image. salt andconnect small dark cracks. Dilation Morphological dilation sets a pixel at i j to the maximum over allpixels in the neighborhood centered at i j. Two methods for performing the inverse Radon transformand reconstructing the original image are compared The Filtered BackProjection FBP and the Simultaneous Algebraic ReconstructionTechnique SART. The maxima of this distance i. It may be used tosuppress high frequency noise in the reconstruction. Todo so one computes an image that is the distance to thebackground. My recommendation would be to start using Python 3 but to write in a backwards compatible manner. Notice how the lightand dark shapes in the center their original thickness but the 3 lighterpatches in the bottom get completely eroded. White tophat The white_tophat of an image is defined as the image minus itsmorphological opening. First we try reconstruction by dilation starting at the edges of the image. Markers for watershed transformThe watershed is a classical algorithm used for segmentation thatis for separating different objects in an image. When calculatingthe Radon transform we need to decide how many projection angles we wishto use. Notice how the white boundary of the image disappears or gets eroded as we increase the size of the disk. divisionThis is very important and causes division of two round integer numbers to return a decimal float instead of a round number. The only tunable parameter for the FBP is the filter which is applied to the Fourier transformed projections. Notice how the whiteellipses at the bottom get connected because of dilation but other darkregion retain their original sizes. Let s also define a convenience function for plotting comparisons Erosion Morphological erosion sets a pixel at i j to the minimum over allpixels in the neighborhood centered at i j. The filteredback projection is among the fastest methods of performing the inverseRadon transform. The Canny has three adjustable parameters the width of the Gaussian thenoisier the image the greater the width and the low and high threshold forthe hysteresis thresholding. In a gradient image the areas of high values provide barriers that help tosegment the image. Also notice the increase in size of the two black ellipses in the center and the disappearance of the 3 light grey patches in the lower part of the image. Filtering regional maximaHere we use morphological reconstruction to create a background image whichwe can subtract from the original image to isolate bright features regionalmaxima. These maximal pixels willget dilated in order to reconstruct the background image. Therefore Scikit image includes a function to evaluatethresholding algorithms provided by the library. This operation is particularly useful when your images areunevenly illuminated. We typically import the package as np since this is shorter to type Plots and figures with MatplotlibMatplotlib is a very helpful library for plotting graphs and displaying images. Instead of creating a seed image with maxima along the image border we canuse the features of the image itself to seed the reconstruction process. Below we use disk to create a circular structuringelement which we use for most of the following examples. Otsu s method 2 _ calculates an optimal threshold marked by a red line in thehistogram below by maximizing the variance between two classes of pixels which are separated by the threshold. As the inverse Radon transform reconstructs the object from a set ofprojections the forward Radon transform can be used to simulate atomography experiment. find_contours array values are linearly interpolatedto provide better precision of the output contours. The following examples are from X ray tomography but can be applied in other areas. Contour findingWe use a marching squares method to find constant valued contours in an image. It uses a filter based on thederivative of a Gaussian in order to compute the intensity of the gradients. Below is theoriginal image and its Radon transform often known as its sinogram Reconstruction with the Filtered Back Projection FBP The mathematical foundation of the filtered back projection is the Fourierslice theorem 2 _. Opening can remove small bright spots i. the coins are clearly isolated the coinssurrounded by a bright background in the original image are dimmer in thesubtracted image. Showing ImagesImages can be shown using the imshow or matshow commands in plt for the most part we will focus on using the imshow commandThe we know the image should be 25 pixels ranging between 0 and 25 but it shows up as a nice smooth graphic did we do something wrong Yes the default settings of matplotlib sometimes have the interpolation parameter set to something that makes the images appear higher resolution or smoother than the really are. TheGaussian reduces the effect of noise present in the image. Equivalently this threshold minimizesthe intra class variance. The dilationoperation that follows ensures that light regions that are larger thanthe structuring element retain their original size. Computer Graphics SIGGRAPH 87 Proceedings 21 4 July 1987 p. These two commands you should include in every file or notebook. Here a marker image is built from the region of low gradient inside the image. print_functionThe print_function forces you to type print hello instead of print hello the former works in both 2 and 3 while the later only works in 2. py We illustrate how to apply one of these thresholding algorithms. Although the features i. A single projection of a 2D object is one dimensional. 4 AH Andersen AC Kak Simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique SART a superior implementation of the ART algorithm Ultrasonic Imaging 6 pp 81 94 1984 The forward transform As our original image we will use the Shepp Logan phantom. pepper andconnect small bright cracks.
