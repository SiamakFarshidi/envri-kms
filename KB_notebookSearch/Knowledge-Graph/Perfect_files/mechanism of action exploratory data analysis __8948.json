It would be advisable to fork and open the NB in edit mode to access the Dropdown Widget. A Q Q plot or quantile quantile plot compares quantiles of the dataset. This communicates that there might not be any redundant information coming from these variables. The univariate analysis will help us understand the predictors while multivariate analysis will help us establishes cause and effect or other relationships. Univariate AnalysisIn this section we will visualize the predictors one by one to understand their distribution describe statistical summaries and find patterns in the data. The predictive score isn t much high here which backs our hypothesis that High positive correlation is due to two primary areas of concentration one being in range of 2 2 and other around 10. Because the number of variables in the gene expression predictor family are way too high it won t be feasible to plot each and every one of those in this notebook. All the c predictors have fat tails with peak around the 10. Exploratory Data AnalysisNow that we have a brief overview of the data we can delve deeper into the data exploration. Cell ViabilityThe appraoch to explore the relationships among the Cell Viability predictors will remain the same as that in Gene Expression predictors. There is isn t much predictive power in among the gene expression variables. To check the sparsity of data we will calculate the percentage of the non zero classes in each train_targets. com rip correlation introducing the predictive power score 3d90808b9598 and thought of using this in the analysis. Note The Jupyter Widgets doesn t work after committing the notebook. IntroductionThe objective of this notebook is to do a exploratory analysis of Mechanism of Action MoA Prediction https www. Target FeaturesThere are total of 206 target features which belongs to categories such as inhibitor activators agonists etc. Predictive power score of Cell Viability predictors Insights1. com c lish moa overview description data using Matplotlib and Seaborn. Unlike the gene expression predictors the predictors do have a predictive among themselves. Gene ExpressionTo identify the relationship between two predictors in the gene expression data we plot a jointplot with a regression line. Looking at the alternatives of the correlation it can be quite misleading I found this blog https towardsdatascience. The control pertubations have no MoAs. To describe the biological activity of a given molecule scientist assign a label referred to as Mechanism of action or MoA. The distributions seems very similar across different dose time frames. The tails in the both graphs shows that the distribution are skewed to right. In the train_target every target has two classes 0 and 1. DatasetIn this competition we have a dataset that combines gene expression and cell viability data. About the ChallengeTo understand the biological mechanism of the disease scientists seek to identify the protein target associated with the disease and develop a molecule that can modulate that protein target. Like cp_time it is also evenly distributed. The cp_time indicated treatment duration and contains three distinct time durations 24 48 and 72 hours with observations almost evenly distributed among these durations. These targets are divided into two categories scored and non scored. Checking the number of nulls and uniques in each predictor of the train_df. I guess it is because of this tail that we see positive correlations here. So I am selecting 10 random variables below and calculating PPScore for them. The agonists and antagonists are not equal to each other. Most of the target variables are inhibitors. Whether the sample is treated with compound or not4. In the following visualization we plot a frequency plot of different types of features available to us. In the training set majority of the data samples are the one treated with compound 11 times the data samples of control pertubations. We will explore the predictors first with the regression plot and kde plot and then look into the predictive power among these variables. So we will use the dropdown widget here too to include all the cell viability data predictors. Like gene expression predictors these too are quite a few in numbers 100 to be precise. Becuase the gene expression predictors are 772 in number it won t be possible to show each as a seperate plot so we will go with Dropdown Widget. CP Variables Insights 1. 3 we did a fat tail analysis that shed light on how despite looking like a bell curve the distributions of Cell Viability predictors deviate largely from the theoretical normal distribution. Due to similar reason as above widgets are not working after committing. Predictive Power score of gene expression predictorsIn this section we explore the predictive power score among the variables in the gene expression family. Unlike the gene expression predictors the cell viability predictors do have significant correlation among themselves. This is backed by the jointplots above where two variables were weakly correlated. The cp_type indicates sample treated with compound trt_cp or control pertubations ctl_vehicle. Though the distributions seems like normal distribution the tails cause quite a deviation as seen in the QQ plot. This affects the correlation in general as the best fitted line is more or less parallel to the x axis hence predictors are weakly correlated. Analyze fat tail using Q Q PlotAs we see quite a fat tails in all the cell viability predictors we will analyze it bit more using the Q Q plots. In the competition like this fat tail could carry disproportionately high impact. Multivariate AnalysisAfter looking into the distributions and frequency plots whichever applicable and developing a understanding of individual predictors we will look how these predictors interact among themselves. Drugs can have multiple MoA annotations which describe binary cell responses from different cell type in different ways. CP VariablesThese predictors indicates whether a certain observation or sample is treated with compound or not. These tails are all on the left side. The section 02 will visualize different predictors alone and against other variables. Thus the problem that we have here is of multi label classification. These tails indicate high likelihood of the improbable events and could be hard of for the machine learning model to grasp. The cp_dose indicates dose being high or low. Similarly checking the number of nulls and uniques in train_targets scored. TrainsetThe trainset contains 876 predictors which can be divided into four broad categories 1. Though the variance is high it is clear from the density plot above the data is concentrated in the range 2 2. The concentration of the observations here too is in the range of 2 2 but with some concentration around negative tail too. Following table shows the train_targets that are scored. To use the widget uncomment the following two cells blocks. One of the greatest disadvantage of using predictive power is the speed it is much slower than the correlation. The risk associated with imperfectly modelling these tails is called tail risk. Cell Viability DataAll the columns that starts with c refers to cell viability data. Skewness is also visible in the many of the gene expression predictors. The variance between two gene expression predictors here g 0 and g 1 is high. But it works fairly well in the edit mode. The probability distributions of g predictors are bell shaped with mean of all around 0. It compares the quantiles of the real world dataset against the theoretical normal distribution. The data is based on a technology that measures simultaneously human s cell response to drugs in a pool of 100 different cell types. Identifier sig_id Train Targets scored and non scored The train_targets contains the binary MoA targets. While by definition agonist causes an action and antagonist will inhibit it my initial understanding was they might be equal to each other. This is evident in the above graphs. 2 the cv_list used in the following line is defined in section 2. There is some difference in the 48 hour dose time between the D1 and D2 distribution for samples treated with the compound.
