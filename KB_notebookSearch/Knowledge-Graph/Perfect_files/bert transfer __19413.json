This optimizer matches Pytorch Adam optimizer Api therefore it becomes straightforward to integrate it within fastai. html Tokenizer takes as tok_func argument a BaseTokenizer object. ai videos lesson 4 given by Jeremy Howard. Next we will use fit_one_cycle with the chosen learning rate as the maximum learning rate. I hope you enjoyed this first article and found it useful. com 2019 05 13 a tutorial to fine tuning bert with fast ai May 2019 Dev Sharma s article Using RoBERTa with Fastai for NLP https medium. bert CLS tokens SEP padding roberta CLS prefix_space tokens SEP padding distilbert CLS tokens SEP padding xlm CLS tokens SEP padding xlnet padding tokens SEP CLS It is worth noting that we don t add padding in this part of the implementation. As we will see later fastai manage it automatically during the creation of the DataBunch. To do so you have to first tokenize and then numericalize the texts correctly. Now you can predict examples with Export LearnerIn order to export and load the learner you can do these operations As mentioned here https docs. As mentioned in the HuggingFace documentation BERT RoBERTa XLM and DistilBERT are models with absolute position embeddings so it s usually advised to pad the inputs on the right rather than the left. We can now submit our predictions to Kaggle In our example without playing too much with the parameters we get a score of 0. Integrating transformers with fastai for multiclass classificationBefore beginning the implementation note that integrating transformers within fastai can be done in multiple different ways. To do so just follow the instructions here https github. Learner Custom Optimizer Custom MetricIn pytorch transformers HuggingFace had implemented two specific optimizers BertAdam and OpenAIAdam that have been replaced by a single AdamW optimizer. Even if the first solution seems to be simpler Transformers does not provide for all models a straightforward way to retreive his list of tokens. Because of that I think that pre trained transformers architectures will be integrated soon to future versions of fastai. As you will see in the DataBunch implementation the tokenizer and numericalizer are passed in the processor argument under the following format processor TokenizeProcessor tokenizer tokenizer. References Hugging Face Transformers GitHub Nov 2019 https github. For that reason this tutorial integrates only the transformer architectures that have a model for sequence classification implemented. These model types are BERT from Google XLNet from Google CMU XLM from Facebook RoBERTa from Facebook DistilBERT from HuggingFace However if you want to go further by implementing another type of model or NLP task this tutorial still an excellent starter. 06146 Keita Kurita s article A Tutorial to Fine Tuning BERT with Fast AI https mlexplained. It worth noting that the integration of the HuggingFace transformers library in fastai has already been demonstrated in Keita Kurita s article A Tutorial to Fine Tuning BERT with Fast AI https mlexplained. com fastai fastai blob master README. Below you can find the resume of each pre process requirement for the 5 model types used in this tutorial. Custom TokenizerThis part can be a little bit confusing because a lot of classes are wrapped in each other and with similar names. Fortunately HuggingFace https huggingface. co transformers model_doc bert. This is because fastai adds its own special tokens by default which interferes with the CLS and SEP tokens added by our custom tokenizer. Create a new class TransformersVocab that inherits from Vocab and overwrite numericalize and textify functions. html pretrained models. com huggingface transformers https github. Like the ULMFiT method we will use Slanted Triangular Learning Rates Discriminate Learning Rate and gradually unfreeze the model. To use our one_cycle we will need an optimum learning rate. Note here that we use slice to create separate learning rate for each group. Notice we are passing the include_bos False and include_eos False options. In his demo he used an AWD LSTM neural network pre trained on Wikitext 103 and get rapidly state of the art results. Regarding XLNET it is a model with relative position embeddings therefore you can either pad the inputs on the right or on the left. Setting Up the Tokenizer retreive the list of tokens and create a Vocab object. The sentiment labels are 0 Negative 1 Somewhat negative 2 Neutral 3 Somewhat positive 4 PositiveThe data is loaded into a DataFrame using pandas. Therefore I implemented the second solution which runs for each model type. You will see later that those classes share a common class method from_pretrained pretrained_model_name. We can decide to divide the model in 14 blocks 1 Embedding 12 transformer 1 classifierIn this case we can split our model in this way Check groups Note that I didn t found any document that has studied the influence of Discriminative Fine tuning and Gradual unfreezing or even Slanted Triangular Learning Rates with transformers. As we are not using RNN we have to limit the sequence length to the model input size. com c sentiment analysis on movie reviews overview. For that reason I decided to bring simple solutions that are the most generic and flexible. For example if we use the RobBERTa model and that we observe his architecture by making print learner. export and load_learner https docs. There is multible ways to create a DataBunch in our implementation we use the data block API https docs. 70059 which leads us to the 5th position on the leaderboard ConclusionIn this NoteBook I explain how to combine the transformers library with the beloved fastai library. TrainNow we can finally use all the fastai build in features to train our model. The BaseTokenizer object https docs. Custom NumericalizerIn fastai NumericalizeProcessor object https docs. An instruction to perform that split is described in the fastai documentation here https docs. Here 2x10 3 seems to be a good value. So you just have to instal transformers with The current versions of the fastai and transformers libraries are respectively 1. It is worth noting that in the dataset there are no individual movie reviews but rather phrases taken out of context and split into smaller parts each with an assigned sentiment label. html The data block API which gives more flexibility. More precisely I try to make the minimum of modification in both libraries while making them compatible with the maximum amount of transformer architectures. You can also find this information on the HuggingFace documentation https huggingface. Dev Sharma s article Using RoBERTa with Fastai for NLP https medium. For example if you want to use the Bert architecture for text classification you would use BertForSequenceClassification https huggingface. The implementation gives interesting additional utilities like tokenizer optimizer or scheduler. Fortunately the tokenizer class from transformers provides the correct pre process tools that correspond to each pre trained model. In this implementation be carefull about 3 things 1. html BaseTokenizer implement the function tokenizer t str List str that take a text t and returns the list of its tokens. Attention is all you need https arxiv. Here we unfreeze all the groups. ai and Sebastian Ruder introduced the Universal Language Model Fine tuning for Text Classification https medium. It consists of using the functions convert_tokens_to_ids and convert_ids_to_tokens in respectively numericalize and textify. Since the introduction of ULMFiT Transfer Learning became very popular in NLP and yet Google BERT Transformer XL XLNet Facebook RoBERTa XLM or even OpenAI GPT GPT 2 begin to pre train their own model on very large corpora. co qspmrcm fastai transformers 1. It is worth noting that in this case we use the transformers library only for a multi class text classification task. As a result besides significantly outperforming many state of the art tasks it allowed with only 100 labeled examples to match performances equivalent to models trained on 100 more data. html load_learner you have to be careful that each custom classes like TransformersVocab are first defined before executing load_learner. Print the available values for pretrained_model_name shortcut names corresponding to the model_type used. This year the transformers became an essential tool to NLP. This time instead of using the AWD LSTM neural network they all used a more powerful architecture based on the Transformer cf. To resume if we look attentively at the fastai implementation we notice that 1. Unfortunately the model architectures are too different to create a unique generic function that can split all the model types in a convenient way. postDistributed sk 119c3e5d748b2827af3ea863faae6376. One way to access them is to create a custom model. com r url https 3A 2F 2Farxiv. As a result without even tunning the parameters you can obtain rapidly state of the art results. com huggingface transformers installation. Fastai with HuggingFace Transformers BERT RoBERTa XLNet XLM DistilBERT fastai Transformers https i. For each text movie review the model has to predict a label for the sentiment. ai Fastai documentation Nov 2019 https docs. Therefore we can simply create a new class TransformersBaseTokenizer that inherits from BaseTokenizer and overwrite a new tokenizer function. For those models the encoding methods should be called with add_prefix_space set to True. md installation and here https github. In Kaggle the fastai library is already installed. Check batch and tokenizer Check batch and numericalizer Custom modelAs mentioned here https github. Data pre processingTo match pre training we have to format the model input sequence in a specific format. Custom processorNow that we have our custom tokenizer and numericalizer we can create the custom processor. We evaluate the outputs of the model on classification accuracy. Meanwhile this tutorial is a good starter. com huggingface transformers. ULMFiT was the first Transfer Learning method applied to NLP. Thanks for reading and don t hesitate in leaving questions or suggestions. Most of the models require special tokens placed at the beginning and end of the sequences. The first time I heard about ULMFiT was during a fast. Libraries InstallationBefore starting the implementation you will need to install the fastai and transformers libraries. NumericalizeProcessor vocab vocab. Setting up the DatabunchFor the DataBunch creation you have to pay attention to set the processor argument to our new custom processor transformer_processor and manage correctly the padding. html bertconfig for the configuration class. com p fastai with transformers bert roberta xlnet xlm distilbert 4f41ee18ecb2 source email 29c8f5cf1dc4 writer. We can find all the shortcut names in the transformers documentation here https huggingface. com analytics vidhya using roberta with fastai for nlp 7ed3fed21f6c which makes pytorch_transformers library compatible with fastai. com 2019 05 13 a tutorial to fine tuning bert with fast ai Section Initializing the Learner the num_labels argument. Main transformers classesIn transformers each model architecture is associated with 3 main types of classes A model class to load store a particular pre train model. Although these articles are of high quality some part of their demonstration is not anymore compatible with the last version of transformers. The TokenizeProcessor object https docs. html TokenizeProcessor takes as tokenizer argument a Tokenizer object. com 2019 05 13 a tutorial to fine tuning bert with fast ai which makes pytorch_pretrained_bert library compatible with fastai. Util functionFunction to set the seed for generating random numbers. He also explained key techniques also demonstrated in ULMFiT to fine tune the models like Discriminate Learning Rate Gradual Unfreezing or Slanted Triangular Learning Rates. Therefore using these tools does not guarantee better results. html Discriminative layer training. In our case the parameter pretrained_model_name is a string with the shortcut name of a pre trained model tokenizer configuration to load e. Let s first analyse how we can integrate the transformers tokenizer within the TokenizeProcessor function. From this analyse we suggest two ways to adapt the fastai numericalizer 1. com 2019 05 13 a tutorial to fine tuning bert with fast ai as the function get_preds does not return elements in order by default you will have to resort the elements into their correct order. ai course https course. As specified in Keita Kurita s article https mlexplained. com analytics vidhya using roberta with fastai for nlp 7ed3fed21f6c Section 1. Although these models are powerful fastai do not integrate all of them. Likely it allows you to use Slanted Triangular Learning Rates Discriminate Learning Rate and even Gradual Unfreezing. Discriminative Fine tuning and Gradual unfreezing Optional To use discriminative layer training and gradual unfreezing fastai provides one tool that allows to split the structure model into groups. Thereby you will have to implement a custom split for each different model architecture. The transformers library can be self sufficient but incorporating it within the fastai library provides simpler implementation compatible with powerful fastai tools like Discriminate Learning Rate Gradual Unfreezing or Slanted Triangular Learning Rates. In order to switch easily between classes each related to a specific model type I created a dictionary that allows loading the correct classes by just specifying the correct model type name. A configuration class to load store the configuration of a particular model. A tokenizer class to pre process the data and make it compatible with a particular model. html NumericalizeProcessor takes as vocab argument a Vocab object https docs. He demonstrated how it was easy thanks to the fastai library to implement the complete ULMFit method with only a few lines of codes. We can find this learning rate by using a learning rate finder which can be called by using lr_find. Some models like RoBERTa require a space to start the input string. We then unfreeze the second group of layers and repeat the operations. It is worth noting that for reproducing BertAdam specific behavior you have to set correct_bias False. com analytics vidhya using roberta with fastai for nlp 7ed3fed21f6c Sep 2019. To make our transformers adapted to multiclass classification before loading the pre trained model we need to precise the number of labels. This implementation is a supplement of the Medium article Fastai with Transformers BERT RoBERTa XLNet XLM DistilBERT https medium. The Tokenizer object https docs. com huggingface transformers models always output tuples every model s forward method always outputs a tuple with various elements depending on the model and the configuration parameters. Creating predictionNow that the model is trained we want to generate predictions from the test dataset. The point here is to allow anyone expert or non expert to get easily state of the art results and to make NLP uncool again. postDistributed sk 119c3e5d748b2827af3ea863faae6376 I made another version available on my GitHub TODO add link. Also remember the upvote button is next to the fork button and it s free too Introduction Story of transfer learning in NLPIn early 2018 Jeremy Howard co founder of fast. The example taskThe chosen task is a multi class text classification on Movie Reviews https www. html bertforsequenceclassification for the model class BertTokenizer https huggingface. For Slanted Triangular Learning Rates you have to use the function one_cycle. html berttokenizer for the tokenizer class and BertConfig https huggingface. co transformers pretrained_models. We will pick a value a bit before the minimum where the loss still improves. For more information please check the fastai documentation here https docs. In our case we are interested to access only to the logits. Note that in addition to this NoteBook and the Medium article https medium. The difficulty here is that each pre trained model that we will fine tune requires exactly the same specific pre process tokenization numericalization than the pre process used during the pre train part. In the fastai library data pre processing is done automatically during the creation of the DataBunch. You can like decribed in the Dev Sharma s article https medium. NB The functions __gestate__ and __setstate__ allow the functions export https docs. Therefore we first freeze all the groups but the classifier with We check which layer are trainable. co created the well know transformers library https github.
