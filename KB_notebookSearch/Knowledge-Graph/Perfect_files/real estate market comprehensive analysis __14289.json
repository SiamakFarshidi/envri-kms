Since we know that Postcode is a catergorical data we will be casting it to categoryAfter carefully evaluating data it can be noticed that variables Rooms and Bedroom2 are pretty much similar and one of the columns should be removed to avoid duplication of data Working with missing DataThere are multiple ways that we can use to explore missisng data. In terms of counts Southern condo units has great market potential as its count rank No. Region Versus Price Region Price Change VS Year per typeIn General East north south and west Metro are popular area based on sales count. 4 Actual count over 1000 for each year pet type and region2. fit X_train y_train Define Function to get correlation refine results and storage values store feature performance Ploting learning curves. 7 Heat map for relationshipsData linear modeling to see which variable contribute most 20394 records 3. Regarding house S Metro has over 5 in price growth in 2017 and 4718 sales count in three years ranking second place among all. 3 with abs value Group Regionname categories Finding coefficient Fit Import model Create linear regression object Fit model to training data Predict Predicting test set results Histogram of the distribution of residuals model RandomForestClassifier n_estimators 20 model. By exploring above table it can be concluded that 1 data item in the range 0 100 0002 data item in range 7M 8M1 data item in range 8M 9M1 data item in range 11M 12M For the purpose of this study let us drop rows that match above mentioned conditions27239 record will be used for presenting Data Presentation and RelationshipThe first fator we look at is the price Versus Year and season. At this point we are ignoring it but at later state if we will take those as our feature variables for our model we will explore ways to fill in those information or to remove those from our data. But before removing it lets first ensure that we have very few values in that range. select_dtypes include numerics data subset by type house price condo price townhouse price house condo and townhouse price groupby year and mean sns. 1 Top 10 house type in S Metro with different rooms and bathrooms by count2. Abbreviate Regionname categories for presentation South region price change VS year per type East region Price change vs year one type for Condo define function to get year growth rate against price per region and type df2 df2 id. com kaggle docker python For example here s several helpful packages to load linear algebra data processing CSV file I O e. 1 Exploring data such select_dtypes. Linear model has some limitations as if more rooms does equal to higher price and more sales count. It inclues data cleaning against data type outliers null value. In next step let s explore the count of missing valuesFrom the information above we can notice that few feature varaibles still have large percentage of missing values. 4 after its unit in same region. Southen house also has great market and rank no. in this step we will cast date to datetime describe command will give us all statistical information about our numerical variables in this step we will first confirm our above statement by observing Rooms and Bedroom2 we can see that the difference is very minimal here that will be wise to remove one of the 2 columns visualizing missing values Percentage of missing values Also since our target variable is price it makes sense to drop rows for price columns where price values are missing filling up the missing data with Fillna Percentage of missing values Lets drop those outliers drop the outliers in rooms sns. distplot melbourne_data kde False bins 20. 2 Top 20 region per type with largest count2. though count is less compared to southern region Seasonal PerformanceIn general it looks like that winters in 2016 an 2017 have the least sales count. 2 table per region and type Actual count over 1000 for each year per type and regionFrom above information count growth percentage and acutal sales count by year South metro and N Metro seems to be the area where people tend to pay more and buy more but as price kept going up those live in south try to move to E and SE MetroTo Conclude this section 1. 2 biggest coefficient compared to other regions. The dataset miss great amount of value in 2018 and it results in that count cannot be used as model output. This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed It is defined by the kaggle python Docker image https github. 6 ideal house type we can see uints condo in Southern Metro was ranked no. input directory For example running this by clicking run or pressing Shift Enter will list all files under the input directory You can write up to 20GB to the current directory kaggle working that gets preserved as output when you create a version using Save Run All You can also write temporary files to kaggle temp but they won t be saved outside of the current session importing the libaries for scientific computing Loading the dataset Verifying columns with object data type changing all object data types to category This step is necessary to be able to plot categorical data for our analysis looking at data information above we can notice that Date is also converted to category. 4 Region vs price change and growth rate vs year2. mean insights Increase distance reduce price define function to refine those correlation more than 0. Then predict Price using Linear fuction for 2019 and 2020Price trend against year per houseHouse price was going down dramatically by 100 000 units Condo price climb up slowly while Townhouse price kept steady. 2 Top 10 house type in all regions per type with different rooms and bathrooms by count2. 3 Dealing with null value mainly replacing null in price with mode using fillna 1. 3 and price kept increasing by years presented in section 2. 1 Predict price for unit in E Metro2. That means Southern Metro has the great market in price. Melboune house price prediction growth area identification and modeling linear random tree forest and logistic LayoutData structure. Predicting house price for all types in South Metro units in South Metro and units in East Melbourne for 2019 and 2020From this rough approximation 2019 average price will be 1557639 1630019 for 2020 for all types in melbounePredict price for S Metro unitFor Condo in S Metro region price will be aroud 795272 dollars with lower R2 Predicting Price for E metro unitFor E Metro price grow 10 from 2016 to 2017 and 7. 6 Ideal house type for top 10 region per type max count of sales2. 5 Car space is linked to an increase in Price by 37952 Year is linked to an increase in Price by 29458. Changing Data typefor the next few steps we will be doing data preparation for Numerical features variablesObserving above information abount numerical data it can be noticed that Postcode is also being treated as numerical data. 2 Getting coefficient3. 1 Define fuction to get correlation refine results and storage value4. 2 Learning curve Plot training scores against validation scoreConclusion Exploring Data and Data CleaningLooking at the data information above we can see that non numerical data is being considered as object. Though house in North and West Metro has the most count but their price is going down as showed in section 2. read_csv Input data files are available in the read only. more feature engineering against sales count will be explored such as count growth in region against year. 3 but not in effect and more investigation using different strategy will be applied. Top 10 house type in all regions per type with different rooms and bathrooms by countInsights North metro house was the most favorable types among those and W Metro follow behind. The list include the following columns Suburb Address Type Method SellerG Date CouncilArea Regionname. 2 Changing data type date type and catogory type1. 5 Other features method distance rooms car vs price2. 1 Predict price for unit in S Metro2. If 2017 was chozen to look at growth in price units and townhouse in E Metro SE Metro and S Metro townhouse in W Metro and house in S Metro present positive growth over 5. Year 2018 seems a lot of missing data and date shape only one third compard to the others thus it is hard to make conclusion. They have count growth over 100 and price growth rate over 8. 8 Bathroom is linked to an increase in Price by 141730. 6 Distance is linked to an decrease in Price by 44797 Bathroom is linked to an increase in Price by 185170 Car space is linked to an increase in Price by 38890 Year is linked to an increase in Price by 44305 Type code is associated with increase in Price by 271838After using fillna Every unit increase in those features will Rooms is linked to an increase in Price by 217253. There are so many missing values in Building Area and Year Built features. Feature engineering to get count growth and price growth against year per region and type Price Growth rate over 0. 3 Top 10 units in E Metro with different rooms and bathrooms by count2. But the price kept dropping compared to units in same region. 01 throughout 1400 samples. On the other hand data is data the perfect r2 sometimes doesn t mean the great insights of a business. Suplots of other numeric features vs Price Method VS Price Number of Rooms impact on Price VS Year Distance vs Price Car Park vs Price Ideal House typeIn this section count will be used to find out leads about the best sales type in all regionTop 10 house type in S Metro with different rooms and bathrooms by countInsights In S Metro house with 3 rooms and 1 or 2 bathroom and house with 4 rooms and 2 bathrooms have the most sales among all. 3 Count growth rate over 0. From section 3 and 4 though the score is low due to low coefficient values Southern Metro show No. 7 in price growth in 2017 from Section 2. Based on data our experience and business need we will either fill in missing values or we will drop rows or columns having null valuesFrom the visual above it can be concluded that we have few missing data in Price Bathroom Car and Landsize Longitude and Latitude columns. On the basis of conclusion 1 4 Units with 2 room and one bathroom in Southern Metro will be recommended to investor or home developer as it has 955 count in 3 years ranking No. looking at 2018 it seems people shift to buy more from SE or E Metro from S Metro. mode Every unit increase in those features will Rooms is linked to an increase in Price by 170624. Here we will be using a visual way first to get some hint. 3 in counts and price kept increaing steadily 6. In next few steps we will work in our data to get rid of outliers if any From the statstical summary above we can see that max price in our data is nearly 11. But this shift was not that significant yet in count as it showed in later table. so the code is there in 1. CONCLUSIONBased on all 4 sentions some finding and conclusion can be found as follow 1. 1 Year vs price per type2. To developer it is time to built more condos in 2019. With limited landsize the more rooms and bathroom the higher the price is. 02 and validation score is always under training score by 0. to_frame create X and y instantiate and fit print the coefficients stats modles you have to create a dataframe since the statsmodels formula interface expects it predict for a new observation stats modles create a fitted model print the coefficients you have to create a dataframe since the statsmodels formular interface expects it predict for a new observation print the coefficients predict for a new observations get month information from date How many calls sms and data entries are in each month Prepare data for pie chart to check sales based on month in order to see which month sell most. In general house is more favorable than other types. set xlabel Price melbourne_data. 1 section house price in general will go down and Condo units price will go up. different regressor or K Fold model will be applied to reduced r2 c. 7 in price growth in 2017. 3 Random forest model3. CD Sales count for each region define function to get year growth rate against count per region and type sold method did not affect price sns. E vic coefficient is high but is low in count thus can be neglected. Continue improvement Due to limited timeframe some work need to done to improve linear relationship and reduce r2 value a. 05 table per region and typeDue to a lot of missing data in 2018 S Metro units has 8. 2 Rooms impact on Price VS Year2. Only price can be output variable. Next look at price against region per typein general Townhouse in E Metro Condo in East Metro House in S Metro Condo in S Metro and Condo in N Metro are growing each year. So Cout in past three years and count in 2016 to 2017 will provide more leads for market. 1 Region price change vs year per type2. In the next few steps we will be changing object data types to categorical and Date data types. replace null value with median to see if r2 drops Yes it drops by 0. It is safe area for conservative investment agaist the unstable market. In terms of Units Condo S Metro has 2782 in sales count ranking No. columns describe info and shape 1. House budget need to be cut For home buyers it is time to buy house in 2019. The combination of business unstanding and data can present more real insights of business. 7 Type code is associated with increase in Price by 235465Type code Rooms and bathroom are very important in house price. Finding OutliersOutliers can significantly impact data analysis and can also impact normalization of data. Linear model for coefficient to present impact for Rooms Distance Bathroom Car Year Propertycount Type_Code regionPrepare the dataset and label for training models include removing all null value get_dummies of region change type into numericUsed get_dummies to change category data into numeric date. From this graph it is anticipated that house price will keptgoing down but less slope Townhouse price will kepte unchanged Condo price will increase. 01 and reduce effect of increasing unit against price regarding bathroom car spots reduce training score and vailidation score by 0. so Rooms and Bathroom fall into this categoryonly extract data with high relations to priceLearning curve Plot training scores against validation scoreIt looks like training examples between 6 000 and 15 000 will give less change to the model. If price was only output dependent variables the conclusion will be biased and not looking at the whole pictures. 2 table per region and type2. Units and townhouses in E Metro and SE MEtro has great potential tough now they dont have such attraction as S Metro. 4 Finding outliersData presentation and prediction 7 section. 1 Prepare the dataset and label for training models include removing all null value get_dummies of region change type into numeric3. 4 Model comparison get score functionPerformance evaluation sample size vs machine learning4. 2 Price prediction for 20192. But if slaes count and price be presented as output variables a clear picture will be clear. It is very important in during data prepration to identify them remove them. 4 Distance is linked to an decrease in Price by 42651. that means investing in Condo will be better. But its coefficient can help to understand which factor has great impact. They have count growth over 100 and price growth rate over 8 from Section 2. Top 20 region per type with largest sales count Count Growth rate over 0. Top 10 units in E Metro with different rooms and bathrooms by count The best Condo type in East region Metropolitan is 2 rooms with one bed room Heat map for presenting realtionshipRooms and Bathroom has highest correlation with house price compared to other factors. South Metro condo with 2 bed rooms and 1 bathroom was listed as top 3 in sales count. 7 from 2018 to 2019 can be expected. implot x Year y Price hue Type data melbourne_data x_estimator np.
