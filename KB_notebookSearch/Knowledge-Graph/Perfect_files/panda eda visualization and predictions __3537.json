Prostate cancer begins when cells in the prostate gland start to grow out of control. Visualizing Image and Mask SamplesLet s have a quick first look at the differences between the data providers in regards to the original images and the masks. it might be good idea to use these test cases for validation. The urethra which image. image and mask directories Location of training labels Create alpha mask Mapping 0 background 1 stroma 2 benign epithelium 3 Gleason 3 4 Gleason 4 5 Gleason 5 Mapping 0 background 1 benign 2 cancer x tanh ln 1 exp x dihedral TTA. Valid values are 0 backgound non tissue or unknown 1 benign tissue stroma and epithelium combined 2 cancerous tissue stroma and epithelium combined few images and associated masks for samples with Gleason Score 5 5 Parse all images for train data to extract image characteristics Overlaying masks on the slides As the masks have the same dimension as the slides we can overlay the masks on the tissue to directly see which areas are cancerous. The prostate is below the bladder and in front of the rectum. All the Karolinska images in the training data is graded by the same pathologist. For further analysis we will drop the 100 images without a mask. Differences Between Data ProvidersThey used different scanners with slightly different maximu microscope resolutions and worked with different pathologists for labeling their images. png attachment image. However the system suffers from significant inter observer variability between pathologists limiting its usefulness for individual patients. Valid values are 0 background non tissue or unknown 1 stroma connective tissue non epithelium tissue 2. This overlay can help you identifying the different growth patterns. All suspicious test cases found in this EDA are summarized in a. just behind the prostate are glands called seminal vesicles that make most of the fluid for semen. After the biopsy is assigned a Gleason score it is converted into an ISUP grade on 1 5 scale. It makes some of the fluid that is part of semen. The prostate is gland only in males. Model Prediction linear algebra Plotly for the interactive viewer see last section This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed It is defined by the kaggle python docker image https github. cancerous epithelium Gleason 3 4. One Mislabeled Image In the above dataframe it looks like one image might have been converted to wrong ISUP grade. Cancerous epithelium Gleason 5 Karolinska Regions are labelled. Note that slightly different procedures were in place for the images used in the test set than training set. IntroductionThis Kernel objective is to expolre the dataset for Prostate cANcer graDe Assessment PANDA challenge. OverviewAt first glance we found 100 images without masks. However for the test set we used several pathologists who each labeled the images using ISUP not Gleason and derived a consensus label. The mislabeled image was one of the those images but was later moved to the training set. To do this we load both the mask and the biopsy and merge them using PIL. Cancerous epithelium Gleason 4 5. In practice tissue samples are examined and scored by pathologists according to the so called Gleason grading system which is later converted to an ISUP grade. com kaggle docker python For example here s several helpful packages to load in data processing CSV file I O e. csv file EDA Gleason Score and ISUP GradeThe grading process consists of finding and classifying cancer tissue into so called Gleaon patterns 3 4 or 5. The organizers left us with a Note as described below. Radboud Prostate glands are individually labelled. read_csv Input data files are available in the. Some of the training set images have stray pen marks on them but the test slides are free of pen marks. Expolring images with pen markersIt is mentioned that in training dataset there are few images with pen markers on them. healthy benign epithelium 3. For example running this by clicking run or pressing Shift Enter will list all files under the input directory Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.
