Generate the training data Create 3 bands having HH HV and avg of both Take a look at a iceberg Import Keras. ConclusionTo increase the score I have tried Speckle filtering Indicence angle normalization and other preprocessing and they don t seems to work. We can do pseudo labelling to increase the predictions. Since this is not a actual image but scatter from radar the shape is going to have peaks and distortions like these. Though the score may be different here it works good on LB I got 0. pdfHowever their data have much better resolution so I don t feel that the CNN they used would be suitable here. Basically those reflected signals are called backscatter. Intro about the Data. That s a ship looks like a elongated point. Since Sentinel has only H transmitter return signals are of the form of HH and HV only. You can t be on top 10 using this kernel so here is one beautiful peice of information. From here the structural differences arise and we can exploit those differences using a CNN. We have been given \u03c3o directly in the data. Sentinet 1 sat is at about 680 Km above earth. Now coming to features for the purpose of this demo code I am extracting all two bands and taking avg of them as 3rd channel to create a 3 channel RGB equivalent. Remember in radar data the shape of the iceberg is going to be like a mountain as shown in here. Much better frameworks then others. You may try and see but for me they are not giving any good results. This kernel is specifically is for Beginners who want s to experiment building CNN using Keras. That s a cool looking iceberg we have. It would be helpful if we can create composite images using the backscatter from radar. By using this kernel you can expect to get good score and also learn keras. The data we have been given is backscatter coefficient which is the conventional form of backscatter coefficient given by \u03c3o dB \u03b2o dB 10log10 sin ip sin ic where1. It makes building deep neural networks very easy. WTF is HH HV Ok so this Sentinal Settalite is equivalent to RISTSAT an Indian remote sensing Sat and they only Transmit pings in H polarization AND NOT IN V polarization. There are few papers on ship iceberg classification like this http elib. Get back to building a CNN using Keras. Here is the article related to that https towardsdatascience. This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed It is defined by the kaggle python docker image https github. 2. Sending pulses of signals at a particular angle of incidence and then recoding it back. For example running this by clicking run or pressing Shift Enter will list the files in the input directory Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output. ic is angle of incidence for center of the image3. com kaggle docker python For example here s several helpful packages to load in linear algebra data processing CSV file I O e. We don t have much resolution in images to visualize the shape of the ship. I don t have the data for scatter from ship but being a metal object it should vary differently as compared to ice object. Those H pings gets scattered objects change their polarization and returns as a mix of H and V. AGRICULTURE. You will enjoy for sure. Don t ask why VV is not given because Sentinel don t have V ping transmitter. 019As you can see the HH component varies a lot but HV doesn t. de 99079 2 2016_BENTES_Frost_Velotto_Tings_EUSAR_FP. The shape of the ship is going to be like a point may be like a elongated point. Now coming to the features of \u03c3o Basically \u03c3o varies with the surface on which the signal is scattered from. define our model Building the model Conv Layer 1 Conv Layer 2 Conv Layer 3 Conv Layer 4 Flatten the data for upcoming dense layers Dense Layers Dense Layer 2 Sigmoid Layer Without denoising core features. com simple explanation of semi supervised learning and pseudo labeling c2218e8c769bUpvote if you liked this kernel. The test dataset contain 8000 images We can exploit this. read_csv Input data files are available in the. For example for a particular angle of incidence it varies like WATER.
