Load sample photos 2. The most popular method is histogram equalization which is based on the assumption that a uniformly distributed grayscale histogram will have the best visual contrast Other advanced histogram based enhancement methods include bi histogram equalization BHE block overlapped histogram equalization multi scale adaptive histogram equalization shape preserving local histogram modification etc. Histogram based processing techniques histogram equalization HE histogram specification etc. This project aims at developing a new FuzzyInference System to enhance the contrast of theimages overcoming the shortcomings of the traditional methods.

Introduction Image enhancement is a method of improving thequality of an image and contrast is a major aspect. Overall Pipeline image.

Traditionalmethods of contrast enhancement like histogram equalizationresults in over under enhancement of the image especially alower resolution one. Image contrast enhancement using fuzzy logic https arxiv. png Description Convert input image from RGB to CIELAB progress on L channel Calculate the average pixel intensity M value Fuzzification For each pixel calculate degree of membership of each class based on pixel intensity and M value. Fuzzification of Pixel Intensity 3. A fast and efficient color image enhancement method based on fuzzy logic and histogram http dx. Inference and Defuzzication Mamdani s method IV.
