Focus on specific categories. com volodymyrgavrysh bank marketing campaigns data set description Citation Request This dataset is public available for research. Sourse of the datahttps archive. The details are described in S. Loading data and holding a short Expanatory Data Analysis EDA. The choice of metrics result. Formulating hypotheses regarding individual factors features for conducting correct data clearining and data preparation for modeling Data cleaning stategy Since categorical variables dominate in dataset and the number of weakly correlated numeric variables is not more than 4 we need to transform categorical variables to increase the model s ability to generalize data. Explore numerical features EDA From correlation matrix we observe next most correlated with target feature is call duration. We can build graph to check RandomForestClassifier performatce with OOB score to be sure that critical hyperparametr was correctly selected during Grid Search. Their variance might support model capacity for generalization. building a profile of a consumer of banking services deposits. Yet the duration is not known before a call is performed. rate employment variation rate quarterly indicator numeric 17 cons. Thank you for your time Feel free to conctact https www. 9269 is quite high level to make later assumptions about the data. It is imperative to form target groups based on socio economic categories. Conclusions and recomendations. idx consumer price index monthly indicator numeric 18 cons. This classifier could achive accuracy rate 0. nov dec 10 day_of_week last contact day of the week categorical mon tue wed thu fri 11 duration last contact duration in seconds numeric. In relative terms a high proportion of pensioners and students might be mentioned as well. Although in absolute terms married consumers more often agreed to the service in relative terms the single was responded better. Best communication channel is secullar. The model shows that students and senior citizens respond better to proposal. Building a pipline for Cross Validation and Grid Search procedures search for optimal parameters of the model 5. we intentionally use most basic machine learning models to increase the level of interprebility of the solution Feature description Bank client data 1 age numeric 2 job type of job categorical admin. degree unknown 5 default has credit in default categorical no yes unknown 6 housing has housing loan categorical no yes unknown 7 loan has personal loan categorical no yes unknown Related with the last contact of the current campaign 8 contact contact communication type categorical cellular telephone 9 month last contact month of year categorical jan feb mar. Thus this input should only be included for benchmark purposes and should be discarded if the intention is to have a realistic predictive model. Explore categorical features EDA Primary analysis of several categorical features reveals 1. So we need to transform it to reduce the influence higly correlated features employment rate consumer confidence index consumer price index may describe clients state from different social economic angles. ApproachThe following steps will be performed to complete the task 1. The choice of the most effective model build learninig curve rate6. The roc auc values of the best model of 0. Conducted campaigns were based mostly on direct phone calls offering bank s clients to place a term deposit. school illiterate professional. Loading data and holding a short Expanatory Data Analysis 1. Decision Support Systems Elsevier 62 22 31 June 2014 Task predicting the future results of marketing companies based on available statistics and accordingly formulating recommendations for such companies in the future. Potentially similar micro targeting will increase the overall effectiveness of the entire marketing company. The choice of metrics resultIt is proposed to use ROC_AUC metrics for evaluating different models with additional monitoring of the accuracy metric dynamic. Administrative staff and technical specialists opened the deposit most of all. blue collar entrepreneur housemaid management retired self employed services student technician unemployed unknown 3 marital marital status categorical divorced married single unknown note divorced means divorced or widowed 4 education categorical basic. This approach will allow us to explore models from different angles. 9269 metric is Random forest. Formulating hypotheses regarding individual factors features for conducting correct data clearining and data preparation for modeling. Also after the end of the call y is obviously known. we can not drop them Particular attention should be paid to the Duration Feature and categories that can be treated as binary. The concentration of the bank s efforts will effectively distribute the company s resources to the main factor the bank s contact time with the client it affects most of all on conversion. Home ownership does not greatly affect marketing company performance. It suggests using binning and simple transformation accordingly 0 and 1 For categories of more than 3 types of possible option marital and education it is proposed to use the encode targeting it will allow correctly relate the values to the target variable and use indicated categories in numerical form. other attributes 12 campaign number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client numeric includes last contact 13 pdays number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign numeric 999 means client was not previously contacted 14 previous number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client numeric 15 poutcome outcome of the previous marketing campaign categorical failure nonexistent success social and economic context attributes 16 emp. Increase the time of contact with customers perhaps in a different way formulating the goal of the company. idx consumer confidence index monthly indicator numeric 19 euribor3m euribor 3 month rate daily indicator numeric 20 nr. Conclusions and recomendations What general recommendations can be offered for a successful marketing company in the future This analysis can be carried out at the level of individual bank branches as does not require much resources and special knowledge the model itself can be launched automatically with a certain periodicity. Take into account the time of the company May is the most effective 2. com in volodymyrgavrish Import libraries Read data Build a function to show categorical values disribution temp df count categorical values Convert target variable into numeric Build correlation matrix Replacing values with binary replace with 0 if not contact binary has contact or not binary if were was an outcome of marketing campane change the range of Var Rate Multiply consumer index change the sign we want all be positive values re scale variables less space fucntion to One Hot Encoding One Hot encoding of 3 variable Drop tranfromed features save target variable before transformation Create target encoder object and transoform two value drop target variable set global random state split data collect excess data set all CPU LogisticRegression RandomForestClassifier KNeighborsClassifier DecisionTreeClassifier BaggingClassifier note we use SGDClassifier as classier inside BaggingClassifier SGDClassifier set number set for LogisticRegression set for RandomForestClassifier set for KNeighborsClassifier set for DecisionTreeClassifier set for BaggingClassifier set for SGDClassifier for LogisticRegression for RandomForestClassifier for KNeighborsClassifier for DecisionTreeClassifier for BaggingClassifier for SGDClassifier models that we iterate over dict for later use set empty dicts and list. 903 that is average accuracy among all classifiers 0. Given these factors it is recommended to concentrate on those consumer groups that are potentially more promising. Bank marketing campaigns dataset analysis AbstractThis is dataset that describe Portugal bank marketing campaigns results. if duration 0 then y no. employed number of employees quarterly indicator numeric Output variable desired target 21 y has the client subscribed a term deposit binary yes no 1. Important note this attribute highly affects the output target e. The choice of the most effective model build learninig curve rate Best model Our best performed model with ROC_AUC 0. As you may see it almost the same 80 estimators with best ROC_AUC score and 90 estimators with maximun of OOB scoreLet see the ROC_AUC graphCurve is well distributed with tendency to False Positive Rate. Age income level not always high profession can accurately determine the marketing profile of a potential client. The continuation of such a study may be the formation of a clear customer profile by age gender income and other factors as well as the adaptation of the product itself deposit for a specific category of consumer. If after all marking afforts client had agreed to place deposit target variable marked yes otherwise no. It is possible to use other means of communication. We can build feature importance of RandomForestClassifier with best ROC_AUC score 6. edu ml datasets bank marketingDataset descriptionhttps www.
