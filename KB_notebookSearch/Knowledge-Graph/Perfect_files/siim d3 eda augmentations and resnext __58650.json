Now we can train the model. Which part of the body 5. Our earlier hypothesis now has more depth to it with half approximately of the skin cancer cases located in the torso. rCbILKa3mSHswXZAKu4cxN_7nrFcFMyhAIb2nLfaMaqv61Q0ByPYzoIwVFVlTt5Awre_NajFwfjRGCU7FoMUqOTKcRP1uNl4 myKV4tiTYakMhArR849e4LZmLYITaxX MTDqEHtp4HHQwVewgcf4h1ocIQZ5BEe4IbgcKqItjS3a27djq8TdOvMr693UEAXTx3vNjBZy5 AjzbqPDKpJysg_FzDeOEqS_c0FYZb4O2KksjgL9eq1u4hzw6itrFXhArvXLaAo QQDH7oK58YvS1h9jTsrKtk6AzMyDrBhyYCTSNhlP2Uqq__3LkjtcB0DpHPx2mdkf7JbNx8W_2C6JCsL7zv0XEuoBhNBNNmXSPyFmn0med1CgEMEV4oF2vgQ4Cnjm8EVllfchq1U0E73W_9NYW7WCAP76rNI5VsrbCa0l_g4sPzCJEiBd2WH9bOv3NefF_rogNO0Pa4mTYgsuUyE9XgbFriIfceZZEov4Zae4jSLiLe4cmrfmmiGKUUb94hMb dPSkHkfL2nL8ab9zs1rGbmtUcnKlJGiU3witwH9kr B2ydvLUephf1QU9JTAfLb5DzmFnDyGDlOh_Um1Q0VOeFCKoWXASgYeKJQ__HmaYdFT3AE0RNZiPj yAN0XedIv5nlwBr8APoT_aQ SeA0nS_2aI1oZeUQvxflhclzMV UUBerPjQ2O iDJE. Solar lentigo Like lentigo but caused by UV rays from the sun very common in Delhi cafe au lait macule French for coffee with milk. From Nevus pigmentatious growth we can observe that nevus also has an orange halo which is not so visceral and pronounced. Auto croppingNow we are using auto cropping as a method of preprocessing which is a more refined circle crop if you will. That makes it sort of unavoidable really if you get it because heart and lung cancer are localized to just one area whereas melanoma can sprout literally anywhere. 9o0Do1qM183_XG_hCkXq A __results___files __results___96_0. What comes out is the magnitude spectrum of the image. This is a very basic way to add noise it s known as salt and pepper noise. Ben Graham s method on testing set emsp emsp 8. Image analysis tools that automate the diagnosis of melanoma will improve dermatologists diagnostic accuracy. Malignant image viewing4. Melanoma is a deadly disease but if caught early most melanomas can be cured with minor surgery. Notes This is from https www. We can try the method of Ben Graham Cropping uninformative area everyone know this Here I just find the codes from internet and choose the best one for you 1. This is simple enough if one bothers to take a look one patient has more than 114 growths. Background subtractionAnother thing you can do is background subtraction. looks like the Conjuring now. In this competition you ll identify melanoma in images of skin lesions. Application of our method3. 3 dimensional augmentation techniques As you have seen here it is possible for one to make use of 3 dimensional images in this competition. It also could be that the torso was exposed to UV light which is the cause of melanoma in highly populated regions where pollution allows the sun s UV rays to come in. 3 dimensional image augmentations 10. Grayscale image segmentationThese are now the segmented grayscale images complete with markers. I will demonstrate 2 methods Implementation from grassroots our own model Keras pretrained models. jdCubfO gaFURT7SF4sIqQ __results___files __results___92_0. ISIC is developing proposed standards to address the technologies techniques and terminology used in skin imaging with special attention to the issues of privacy and interoperability i. It was originally used for Data Science Bowl 2017 by Guido Zuldhof but I have adapted it for here this competition. Explanation of our method emsp emsp 2. It breals down an image into its constituent parts represented by the distinction between regions i. It will be a bit difficult for the model to learn anything from this due to the complete and utter confusion pardon me in the image with regard to the clear distinctions between image segments and there is no disctinction between parts of the image. lentigo has not only the orange halo of death but also the green halo which could be what distinguishes lentigo from melanoma I m not great at biology. In addition ISIC has developed and is expanding an open source public access archive of skin images to test and validate the proposed standards. We can try to convert the image to gray scale and visualize better. A finer form of image segmentation Grayscale form emsp emsp 8. If you like do remember to upvote as that s where I get my motivation from. As expected we have a HUGE class distribution here we will need to use undersampling or oversampling to deal with this. It will not damage anythin it s just a small blot on the landscape of your skin. Fourier method for pixel distributionsNow we move on to something more interesting Fourier transforms. Benign image viewingThese are the first 30 melanoma images with benign tumors. Auto cropping indeed is powerful but the risk is that you will lose valuable data in the image. 63LkdMRmfzzZaD0K20kflQ. Age Age is an important factor in carciongenous growth because it helps you to understand who is more vulnerable at an early age and who is more vulnerable at later stages of their life. However it has a heavy downside as we lose all information inside and outside the growth and thus our model loses the capability to understand or learn something from the image. mWTqxqQM59nQBlLwUBoPw. What about test Middle aged people are the most likely to get cancer whereas those on the RHS and LHS of the plot are least likely to get it. Circle crop was first formulated by Tom Aindow and exemplified by Neuron Engineer during the APTOS competition see their effect. Ben Graham s method from 1st competitionThe first method we will use is Ben Graham s method from the first diabetic retionpathy detection competition. APPENDIX C ISIC Winner Solutions 1st place https isic challenge stade. Benign and malignant tumors What is a benign tumor A benign tumor put simply is one that will not cause any cancerous growth. A finer method for image segmentationThis is a finer form of image segmentation where we use a second threshold to finetune our segmented data in a sort of way. so both age_approx and sex have 0. The target is the target feature. EDIT As of 19 06 2020 I have removed grassroots modeling section. The clear regions the clear color differences the clear everything This is probably the best preprocessing method that we can apply. In particular you ll use images within the same patient and determine which are likely to represent a melanoma. We need to isolate malignant tumors from all this. Image Augmentations We need to use image augmentations to add to our existing set of data. Let s check the distribution of values in benign_malignant. Image segmentationThis is called image segmentation. It helps our model to visually understand the distinctions even better than using grayscale images and it also helps to let our model identify the tumor. Image Preprocessing Why is preprocessing any different from augmentation Preprocessing is basically a filter augmentation is basically adding more variations of the same image. ErosionDilationThere Now we can try dilation Now for both Combination of erosion and dilationRoman s microscope augmentation Original pythonclass Microscope def __init__ self p float 0. TF Dataloaders are very slow but they are effective in a way. com kmader skin cancer mnist ham10000 Skin Lesion Images for Melanoma Classification https www. Past Winner s Solutions Skin cancer is the most prevalent type of cancer. Introduction Let s look at first 20 files From this we can infer a LOT of domain knowledge such as The diagnosis feature is a simple diagnosis of the cancer. Melanoma Skin cancer s form what we are working with Seborrheic keratosis Brown waxy and patchy growths that are not related to skin cancer. This archive serves as a public resource of images for teaching and for the development and testing of automated diagnostic systems. shape print img. atypical melanocytic proliferation Abnormal quantities of melanin appear on the skin. Remember your model MUST BE ABLE TO GENERALIZE We have much more augmentations we can try like Mess around with p Not done yet We still have a few more tricks namely erosion and dilation. Here however we can implement multiple noises from a glance. It helps to understand the size with a 3 dimensional spatial representatiion and at the same time helps to understand the limits of our image in a 3 dimensional scale. SIIM ISIC EDA and AugmentationHello all and welcome. Are they all similar of different Do they look the same or not And do they have the all too well known visceral orange halo We shall see. Grayscale imagesWe will first try to visualize in grayscale only gray colors so that it is possible for us to clearly visualize the varied differences in color region and shape. I would like to think of the orange halo as being an event horizon of some sort a point of no return for a killed cell unless chemotherapy of course. It would be interesting to read in a DICOM file and soak in all the metadata. Seborrheic and lichenoid keratosis are both rather similar. Baseline Modeling While everyone is trying to use EfficientNet and transfer learning I think that it is indeed great but we need to try to IMPLEMENT ideas on our own. To put it into perspective PyTorch data loaders are much more fast than TF dataloaders and the only reason we are using TF here is because of keras. Think of circle crop as C and think of auto cropping as C. When recognized and treated in its earliest stages melanoma is readily curable. Now for missing values Now we can see the percentages of missing values. A recommended approach would be to resample the images before plotting it like this. ApplicationThis looks rather well odd but it helps us to get a general picture of the outlines of our image in 3 dimensional perspective. So I have to rerun it a lot because the errors are sometime random and I need to circumvent it. So here I am going to use Depthwise Spatial Convolutions instead of normal Conv2D layers. jdCubfO gaFURT7SF4sIqQ __results___files __results___90_0. About SIIM ISIC organization emsp C. uint8 img. These are brownish spots also called giraffe spots. Attack the model with adversarial learningAppendix emsp A. Albumentations dilation and erosion emsp emsp 8. com topWithHeader tightContentTop about isicArchive The International Skin Imaging Collaboration Melanoma Project is an academia and industry partnership designed to facilitate the application of digital skin imaging to help reduce melanoma mortality. Erosion emsp emsp 8. shape sure background area Finding sure foreground area Finding unknown region sure background area Finding sure foreground area Finding unknown region Add one to all labels so that sure background is not 0 but 1 Now mark the region of unknown with zero The first parameter is the original image kernel is the matrix with which image is convolved and third parameter is the number of iterations which will determine how much you want to erode dilate a given image. What I think this means is that the orange halo occurs when the patient has reached stage 3 stage 4 of serious cancerous growth. A finer form of image segmentation emsp emsp 8. the ability to share images across technology and clinical platforms. Benign image viewing emsp emsp 3. Albumentations dilation emsp emsp 8. Baseline modeling emsp emsp 10. This green halo could be a special characteristic of lentigo that could help our model to distinguish lentigo from other carcinogenic growths. Now we can view malignant tumors Malignant image viewing 4. Diagnosis OK so let s look at the diagnosis feature We have seven types of diagnosed cancerous growths here Unkown a possibly novel type of growth Nevus from Google a usually non cancerous disorder of pigment producing skin cells commonly called birth marks or moles. Circle crop emsp emsp 8. js so it may not look that way. image is too dark so that we crop out everything return original image image is too dark so that we crop out everything return original image. So we have a bell Gaussian or normal distribution of train data. pdf AWSAccessKeyId AKIA2FPBP3II4S6KTWEU Signature E3f4iijeBEYmUWuhJUJtFLi 2Fx 2Fw 3D Expires 1591213432 2nd place http www. Currently dermatologists evaluate every one of a patient s moles to identify outlier lesions or ugly ducklings that are most likely to be melanoma. It does not seem so feasible so I would recommend you try to be smarter in your methods for preprocessing. e in this instance the growth is white and the halo surrrounding area is blackened. Dermatologists could enhance their diagnostic accuracy if detection algorithms take into account contextual images within the same patient to determine which images represent a melanoma. This can be confusing as our model can mix up this orange halo and the other orange haloNow that is cancer. p circle cv2. png MixUp https www. com kf 35223031 eyJhbGciOiJkaXIiLCJlbmMiOiJBMTI4Q0JDLUhTMjU2In0. As with other cancers early and accurate detection potentially aided by data science can make treatment more effective. CutMix MixUp and GridMask12. Albumentations library demonstration emsp emsp 8. In this notebook I shall give you an overview of the new SIIM ISIC Melanoma Detection competition and also a brief overview into our data augmentation techniques using the python library albumentations. Background subtraction emsp emsp 8. Our model needs to diagnose Target Benign Malignant DiagnosisWe will also try some preprocessing ideas such as Reducing lighting condition effects as we will see images come with many different lighting conditions some images are very dark and difficult to visualize. Stage 3 and Stage 4 the most critical level conditions of cancer are only reached when the patient is in serious trouble. It will be coming shortly as soon as I figure out how to properly work with MONAI. Let s define a simple KFold cross validation that we should be able to use in some way. Lichenoid is very good at mimicking other forms of cancer. Neuron Engineer s methodHere we can finally visualize the clear distinctions in our data. A simple enough attack would be to slightly alter an image by adding some noise. Ben Graham s method from first competition emsp emsp emsp 8. We can use the magic of d3. A nice trick with 3 dimensional visualizationExplanationQuite simply we are going to use 3 dimensional plotting to visualize the spatial restrictions of our image as well as the depth of the image and the 3 dimensional representation of the growth in space. com shonenkov merge external data Please upvote his work if you like it. Atypical melanocytic proliferation combines the scary things about melanoma and lentigo and brings them in one place complete with both halos. Here we have to try and implement these ideas. My other works Transformer XL Intro and Baseline A guide to the transformer architecture and its application in m5. Now the splitter sort of splits the data into chunks by adding a certain feature to the data which determines which batch fold the data should go in. Combination of erosion and dilation emsp emsp 8. One could indeed fathom that the torso is frequently exposed either during the occasional workout or the occasional swim or in some cases the occasional extreme adventure. Let s use only simple augmentations. What is melanoma Let s watch a video We learnt that Melanoma destroys melanocytes i. Lichenoid mimics the dangers of real carcinogenous growth with its halo s. CutMix MixUp and AugMix are all very popular nowadays so I have given it a go here using TPUs. Complex Wavelet Transform9. Melanoma specifically is responsible for 75 of skin cancer deaths despite being the least common skin cancer. We also are using the DICOM file type here. Existing AI approaches have not adequately considered this clinical frame of reference. I ll be excluding Unknown for the purpose of clarity. A neat trick wth 3 dimensional visualization emsp emsp 2. ly it is a real toll on my poor computer with 3 gigabyte RAM Will add plotly visualizations later. 2 percent missing values. Dilation emsp emsp 8. It s also expected that almost 7 000 people will die from the disease. Currently a lack of standards for dermatologic imaging undermines the quality and usefulness of skin lesion imaging. shape 0 2 15 0 0 0 1 mask circle 255 img np. It is also observable that we have a class distribution in target with many more 0 s than 1 s I am poor at d3. Remember you can build upon Ben Graham s work as a starting point then try Neuron Engineer s or circle crop or even build you own method. This helps us see some parts of the growth and also it lets us see the images and the halos in small amounts. In the cases without a halo I think that it means that the patient is having a malignant tumor but has not reached critical levels of cancer yet. js to view categorical variables at a glance. NOTE I HAVE COMMENTED THIS BECAUSE IT TAKES A LOT OF TIME I have trained the model for only a few epochs because of time constraints. We also need to analyze how different these sort of skin growths are. Albumentations erosion emsp emsp 8. We can see that in age middle aged people are more likely to get melanoma and cancer in general as studies have shown than people before and past their prime. Why To help our model identify the tumors correctly even in grayscale colormap. p p def __call__ self img if random. com 99bdfa5c 4b6b 4c3c 94c0 f614e6a05bc4 method_description. Roman s microscope augmentation emsp emsp 8. The data is split into fold chunks where fold is the n_splits parameter of our model and the training data is then passed to the model. Due to RAM Constraints I will display only the images of CutMix and MixUp CutMix https www. We can also get a touchy feely sense of this whole thing with Plot. As such if anyone is bold or foolhardy enough to try these I shall make a guide for you to use these. Image segmentation emsp emsp 8. What is a malignant tumor A malignant tumor is the evil twin of the benign tumor it causes cancerous growth. Melanoma in most cases displays the vicious and visceral orange halo as it devours alive other poor cells who where unlucky enough to cross its path. It is helpful to understand where the majority of the growth is concentrated. So we can see that the percentage of missing values doubles in anatom_site_general_challenge from train to test. Alternatively there is a better approach. Why is it so Well medically most of the time cancer patients only reach cancerous conditions with malignant tumors. So how do we do that With the magic of dataframe indexing In each malignant tumor we can observe that the tumor has a visceral orange halo in some cases and in other cases it does not. Here we have 3 batches 3 folds where the data can be separated to. Auto cropping emsp emsp 8. NormalizationWe use normalization to evenly distribute something across an image we can use normalization to for example normalize lighting conditions across the image. Albumentations library demonstrationAlso you can use the albumentations library to create a lot of simulated images for your model. It looks rather gargantuan but fundamentally it is just an overglorified convolutional neural network with some bells and whistles and a lot of layers at that too K Fold Cross ValidationSo as it seems like the train set is 3 times bigger than the test set it makes sense for us to use a 3 fold cross validation split using sklearn s RepeatedKFold class. It has a number of symptoms like Bleeding Patchy skin Light eye color etc. CutMix MixUp AugMix and GridMask This is probably the most famous augmentation method in recent history. We have about 100 200 cases of cancer in the mouth or genitalia the areas with the lowest rate of cancerous growth and the palms and soles also are safe probably because they are not exposed to any external sources in the day to day life of the person. APPENDIX A Melanoma APPENDIX B ISIC Overview Source https www. Digital images of skin lesions can be used to educate professionals and the public in melanoma recognition as well as directly aid in the diagnosis of melanoma through teledermatology clinical decision support and automated diagnosis. Here we can clearly see what is inside the image and where the isolated cells are it forms a figure vaguely resemblant of a skull. If successful classifiers would be more accurate and could better support dermatological clinic work. Lichenoid keratosis It is a thin pigmented sort of plaque if you will. The benign_malignant feature is a feature that determines whether the tumor is benign or malignant benign is harmless malignant is harmful The anatom_site_general_challenge tells us where the cancer is. png Due to RAM constraints this is how GridMask looks like https www. org resource resmgr home jdi_banner 2000x550. maybe not Circle cropCircular crop has successfully worked although it may not be feasible for images where the tumor is on the edge of the image. com c siim isic melanoma classification description.

I will use TensorFlow dataloaders over here to run the model. Attack the modelHow do we think that a model can classify something correctly How do we measure whether small disturbances in image like adding a noise or a random flip or something can affect whether an image is benign or malignant Could we measure peturbance or rather how much the model has been affected in any way Attacking a machine learning model or adversarial learning is by no means a new technique it s been around for a while. Which part of the body Melanoma or skin cancer occurs well wherever your skin is. However the torso has more square area than any other affected part so it seems like the area on a body part is correlated with number of cases on that body part as we can see. Better detection of melanoma has the opportunity to positively impact millions of people. Back to our general EDA now. Literally 80 percent. Benign tumors are frequently the first signs of cancerous growth pacing the way for the malignant tumors. Nothing too complex just our circle crop augmentation will be enough to replicate the effect on some other images. p Albumentations erosionAlbumentations dilationAlbumentations erosion dilationComplex wavelet transform Horizontal detail Vertical detail Hough transform Canny edges 9.
