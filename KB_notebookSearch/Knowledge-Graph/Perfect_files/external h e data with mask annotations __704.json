We have stored them as png files. For everybody s convenient I converted the annotated nuclei from https nucleisegmentationbenchmark. com into a public dataset following the folder structure of the competition data. There are 29 Images are annotated by the following ids Let us load one image and its masks Now we can read the masks for the specific image. In the example below we zoom into a 200x200 pixel window. For the same window we superimpose the masks above the image. To make sure that masks are disconnected we can add them all into a single mask image using np. sum and whenever we find two or more pixels in common assign them to background 0.
