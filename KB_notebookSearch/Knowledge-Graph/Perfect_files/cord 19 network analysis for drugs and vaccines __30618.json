The CORD 19 corpus contains full text foreign language articles including those in Spanish French and German. The Annotator module of TPX performed the annotation on the corpus based on the following dictionaries HUMAN_GENE GENE_SARS GENE_MERS GENE_COVID PHENOTYPE CHEMICALS DRUGS DISEASE SYMPTOM GOPROC GOFUNC GOLOC CELLTYPE TISSUE ANATOMY ORGANISM COUNTRIES ETHICS TERMS general terms related to human ethics NON PHARMA INTERVENTION terms related to non pharmaceutical intervention SURVEILLANCE TERMS general terms related to disease surveillance VACCINE TERMS VIROLOGY TERMS general terms used in virology studies and EARTH SCIENCE TERMS. The submission utilizes both the CORD 19 corpus as well as all of MEDLINE. We now highlight some drugs connected by indirect edges to COVID 19 disease in the network. Kaggle_pipeline_initial. Towards this we filtered the entire tagged MEDLINE for abstracts containing the terms coronavirus infection SARS MERS or COVID 19 or their synonyms. Our final framework would thus capture highly relevant relations from COVID 19 related corpus and would also mine for additional novel associations from the whole of MEDLINE. However we found additional useful COVID 19 related abstracts in MEDLINE. Our approach is motivated by the recent progress in spectral graph convolutions where association inferencing is viewed as a mult step signal propagation over the network by convolving the network with a filter. Convalescent plasma Supported by PMID 32240549 PMID 32219429 PMID 32240462 PMID 32219428 PMID 32220178 PMID 32240545 PMID 32219428 In this preliminary uncontrolled case series of 5 critically ill patients with COVID 19 and ARDS administration of convalescent plasma containing neutralizing antibody was followed by improvement in their clinical status. for the drug development repurposing and vaccine development tasks. This contributes to the understanding of the association of Nsp15 with the viral replication and transcription machinery. Ingavirin pentanedioic acid imidazolyl ethanamide drug combination PMID 27876718 states Research objective was to study the efficacy of Ingavirin for prevention of recurrent herpetic stomatitis in employees of Kazan city industrial enterprises frequently suffering from acute respiratory viral infections. This functionality seems to benefit viral. RESULTSWe now describe how this network can be used to answer some of the questions posed in the challenge using a network exploration and PyVis visualization approach. the placebo treated control. One of the primary goals of our submission is to provide a high quality and a user friendly network based abstraction of the given corpus to explore interesting connections between several entity types. We investigated the protective activity of Ingavirin against the lethal influenza A H1N1 2009 virus infection on albino mice. html DISCUSSIONOur contributions are multi fold 1. Network AugmentationThe correlation based network was further augmented with additional inferred novel links using a graph convolution based technique.

TPX is a modular and versatile biomedical text mining framework. This functionality seems to benefit viral replication as stress granules are inhibitory to replication of MERS CoV 56 and other viruses A separate search of PubMed results in some abstracts not in the corpus that support the correlations mentioned above From PMID 32229706 Similarly two proposed therapeutics for the treatment of COVID 19 infection are Azithromycin and Quercetin both drugs with significant senolytic activity. In such articles there is only a single mention of COVID 19 in the above sentence. Annotator for entity annotations3. We believe that to achieve this we need to go beyond the provided corpus and consider the complete MEDLINE and other data sources. A large number of research papers have been published to this end peer reviewed as well as those posted in preprint repositories such as bioRxiv www. We provide a Jupyter notebook for this. Hence we excluded a total of 854 such foreign language articles. To compute the pair wise correlation for a pair we used the standard Pearson correlation expression. We used the Corpus Processor module of TPX to process this corpus. As Azithromycin and Doxycycline are both commonly used antibiotics that inhibit viral replication and IL 6 production we may want to consider this general class of antibiotics that functionally inhibits cellular protein synthesis as a side effect for the treatment and prevention of COVID 19 disease. The results allow to consider Ingavirin as an effective antiviral against the current pandemic influenza virus. Among NA inhibitors oseltamivir phosphate OSE Tamiflu and zanamivir are approved worldwide whereas peramivir and laninamivir octanoate LAN Inavir are regionally approved for human use PMID 22028647 says The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic pH1N1 led to record sales of neuraminidase NA inhibitors which has contributed significantly to the recent increase in oseltamivir resistant viruses. PRIORI T a tool for rare disease gene prioritization using MEDLINE. if len path depth 1 Load the entire network Query the network with the defined search criteria Build association network using the query result Prepare Entity Maps Display Entity Types. These links have no co occurrence based support from the corpus. Joseph T Saipradeep VG Raghavan GS Srinivasan R Rao A Kotte S Sivadasan N. These could provide a deeper understanding of drug mechanisms disease action etc. We then used the Correlation Extraction module to extract out correlations amongst these entity types and4. Dictionary Curation module2. CoNetz HIGHLIGHTSThis submission used the power of network based analysis for rapid identification of potential new drugs and vaccines. An important caveat to analysing such sub networks each edge or connection was derived from a particular paragraph of the article s in the corpus hence the correlation is only in that context. Mine for novel inferred associations from the whole MEDLINE and augment the network with these to help in better identification of good drug and vaccine targets. The entities span a comprehensive set of entity types namely HUMAN_GENE GENE_SARS GENE_MERS GENE_COVID PHENOTYPE CHEMICALS DRUGS DISEASE SYMPTOM GOPROC GOFUNC GOLOC CELLTYPE TISSUE ANATOMY ORGANISM COUNTRIES ETHICS TERMS NON PHARMA INTERVENTION SURVEILLANCE TERMS VACCINE TERMS VIROLOGY TERMS and EARTH SCIENCE TERMS. We experimented with computing pair wise correlations using different text spans sentence paragraph section and article. 2004 32 Database issue D452 D455. While confirming the critical role of nsp8 in coronavirus replication the study amends the list of activities mediated by coronavirus nsp8 proteins in the absence of other proteins. To illustrate the utility of the notebook we have included a set of use cases for exploring the network using PyVis and NetworkX library. We took the provided CORD19 dataset corpus and filtered these for unique full text articles. Boceprevir telaprevir simeprevir asunaprevir grazoprevir and paritaprevir are NS3 4A inhibitors. Chloroquine Supported by PMID 32219882 PMID 32217113 PMID 32219357 PMID 32074550 PMID 32179150 PMID 32212513 PMID 32179150 Chloroquine remdesivir lopinavir ribavirin or ritonavir have shown efficacy to inhibit coronavirus in vitro. We also identify and describe literature evidence that could support these predictions. We also experimented with augmenting the provided corpus with related MEDLINE abstracts. We have uploaded the network in Kaggle for download and use by the community for solving some of text mining related questions that are posed in this Kaggle challenge PyVis VisualizationWe then used PyVis a Python based library for constructing and visualizing an intuitive and interactive exploration of TCS _COVID _NETWORK. While we provide analysis for a few of the 40 drugs a similar analysis can be done for all 40 or any top K drugs of ones choice. Therefore development and careful evaluation of novel NA inhibitors is of great interest. The degree of the bronchial epithelium damage was also strongly decreased. The network captures associations between different entities in the augmented corpus described earlier. The tools allow easy exploration and visualization of the network for generation of leads. Several use cases to explore leads are illustrated. For instructive purpose and to exhibit the utility of the network based approach we have included a set of use cases. Augmenting the corpus with related MEDLINE abstracts While the provided CORD 19 corpus is an excellent source of COVID 19 articles we experimented to see if there are any related MEDLINE abstracts that could possibly be added to the corpus to improve the precision and recall. Thus the TCS _COVID _NETWORK serves as a knowledge base that could help the COVID 19 research community to obtain pointers for useful relations spanning several entity types through a combination of text mining and network analyses. Recently a highly potent NA inhibitor laninamivir has been approved for use in Japan. Peficitinib an oral Janus Kinase Inhibitor PMID 31093950 says Peficitinib Smyraf Astellas Pharma is a Janus kinase JAK 1 JAK2 JAK3 and tyrosine kinase Tyk 2 pan JAK inhibitor recently approved in Japan for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. However the PyVis and NetworkX functionalities can be easily used to provide and or build richer exploration features using our underlying network. Our data suggest that DAA treatment not only inhibits viral replication but may alter host adaptive and innate immune responses. Let s look at evidences for some of these chemicals and drugs Tocilizumab Supported by PMID 32240462 CORD_UID yy7abob9 PMID 32241792 PMID 32222713 PMID 32209313 and PMID 32243501 PMID 32209313 New therapeutic opportunities for COVID 19 patients with Tocilizumab Possible correlation of interleukin 6 receptor inhibitors with osteonecrosis of the jaw PMID 32240462 Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID 19 a clinical update. Pocapavir PMID 25229269 states Pocapavir V 073 is an investigational drug candidate being developed for poliovirus indications but also has variable antiviral activity against nonpolio enteroviruses. We have listed the public data sources for each of the entity types which would help the user to figure out the entity ID term name to be used for querying. As a result we identified a subset of MEDLINE abstracts that could be used to augment the CORD 19 corpus. Alternative medicines mentioned in literature in the context of COVID 19 include astragali radix shufeng jiedu and lianhuaqingwen. After the clean up we segregated the article text into various spans which included sentence section paragraph and the full article. The inferred associations from MEDLINE are also included in the network with additional flags. Drugs such as Ciclesonide Selamectin Baricitinib Fedratinib Tocilizumab Arbidol and Chloroquine as well as Convalescent plasma therapy. Though the associations are extracted based on co occurrences of the entities in these articles their association strength could be biased due to the limited nature of the corpus. These could be from sources such as IntAct 4. One could think of them as putative suggestions Some text from MEDLINE abstracts about these drugs is also shown. PMID 32240549 The recent Coronavirus Disease 2019 COVID 19 pandemic caused by SARS CoV 2 has prompted not only a search for effective anti viral treatment and spread control measures but also a reconsideration of the use of convalescent plasma for COVID 19 treatment 5 6. Novel leads for re purposing including Ingavirin pentanedioic acid imidazolyl ethanamide combination Pocapavir R 125489 Laninamivir Peficitinib an oral Janus Kinase Inhibitor and Paritaprevir. The caveat here is that since these are not direct connections there is no reference article that talks about them. org and medRxiv www. In fact a recent article PMID 32266873 Targeting SARS CoV 2 A Systematic Drug Repurposing Approach to Identify Promising Inhibitors Against 3C like Proteinase and 2 O RiboseMethyltransferase. Furthermore dictionaries for COUNTRIES ETHICS TERMS NON PHARMA INTERVENTION SURVEILLANCE TERMS VACCINE TERMS VIROLOGY TERMS and EARTH SCIENCE TERMS have been built from public sources as well as with some manual updates specifically for this CORD19 challenge. Of course experiments would need to be done to analyse the effects of addition of such curated associations to text mined associations in these kinds of networks. We also considered the complete MEDLINE abstracts which was used by the network augmentation module to augment the network with inferred novel connections. We used these associations to build the basic TCS _COVID _NETWORK. are targeted by several SARS CoV 2 viral proteins. The Top 15 chemicals and drugs directly associated with COVID 19 disease are shown in the above Figure. There are few terms in the dictionaries that are inserted manually. These correlations extracted by the Correlation Extraction module are then used by the Network Creation module to build a network called TCS _COVID _NETWORK. From PMID 30135128 We also hypothesize that the primase like protein Nsp8 and the Nsp7 Nsp8 complex may interact with Nsp15 and affect enzymatic activity. For each query entity restrict it s neighbourhood to the Top 15 neighbours for each of the filtered entity types and1. However capturing novel connections are equally crucial for identifying useful targets for drugs and vaccines. We removed this sentence from the articles. upper else Falsecn input tShow only connected nodes in the network Y N n cnodes True if Y cn. Bioinformation 8 12 578 80 2012. The COVID 19 Open Research Dataset CORD 19 corpus consists of abstracts and full text articles on COVID 19 SARS CoV 2 and related coronaviruses. Some of the immediate insights derived in the context of COVID 19 1. PMID 21033471 states Despite obvious success in the vaccine development and chemotherapy of influenza it remains a poorly controlled infection leading to emergence of new pandemic variants of the virus with high morbidity and mortality. In addition a large number of peer reviewed papers on earlier coronavirus related diseases such as SARS and MERS are also available. We de duplicated the corpus to remove duplicate articles. To execute the code with multiple queries rerun the code cell using Shift Enter pythonqry_str input Please enter the source Entities separted by comma n qterms qry_str. stress granules and host translation shutoff. A recent article PMID 32251791 A first Case of Meningitis Encephalitis associated with SARS Coronavirus 2 not in the corpus mentions Laninamivir in the context of meningitis in a COVID 19 patient. The modules include 1. In future associations from high quality and heterogeneous curated data with sufficient coverage can be considered for augmenting the network derived solely from text mining.

Network Creation module to build a heterogeneous network of the correlations extracted by the Correlation Extraction module5. Oral use of Ingavirin resulted in sharp decreasing of the mortality index of protection up to 57 slight decreasing of the infectious titer of the virus in the lungs up to 40 fold normalizing of the body weight dynamics and the lung tissue structure vs. The annotator takes care of local abbreviations. These use cases show different ways of exploring the network using PyVis and NetworkX library to find useful insights. For instance the Human Gene dictionary was built using HGNC. Both these knowledge bases are then combined to complement each other so as to amplify the signal and to reduce the overall noise. Network Augmentation module to augment the network with novel links inferred using a graph convolution based approachWe re purposed TPX for the COVID 19 Open Research Dataset Challenge CORD 19 as follows 1. Well known drug re purposing candidates for COVID 19 in CoNetz include remdesivir hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir ritonavir combination as well as convalescent plasma therapy to were seen to be strongly associated with COVID 19 disease node. For instance we recently built PRIORI T 2 a pipeline for phenotype driven rare disease gene prioritization by re purposing specific modules of TPX. Lesser known drug leads such as ciclesonide baricitinib fedratinib tocilizumab and arbidol are also connected to the COVID 19 node. stress granules and host translation shutoff 55. split if tgt_qt else Nonetk_str input tRestrict the network to Top k entities press enter for default 15 n tk int tk_str if tk_str else 15tke_str input tRestrict the network to Top k entities for each Type n tke int tke_str if tke_str else None ie input tShow only inferred edges from GCAS Y N n inf True if Y ie. PMID 31181818 mentions Conclusion Peficitinib suppressed the JAK STAT pathway in RA FLS and also suppressed monocyte chemotaxis and proliferation of FLS through inhibition of inflammatory cytokines Paritaprevir PMID 32108916 says Elimination of the virus with direct acting antivirals DAAs may modify host immune response via altering these immune checkpoint receptors expression. These terms can be searched only by the term name. After tagging we used the Conflict Resolver to resolve conflicts arising from the same text getting annotated by different dictionaries. While in the previous version of our submission only the title and abstract sections we now process the COMPLETE corpus of full text of articles. From PMID 30918070 Replacement of a conserved Lys residue with Ala abolished the in vitro RNA binding and TATase activities of nsp8 and caused a nonviable phenotype when the corresponding mutation was introduced into the HCoV 229E genome confirming that these activities are mediated by nsp8 and critical for viral replication. Phenotype driven gene prioritization for rare diseases using graph convolution on heterogeneous networks. To reiterate the provided CORD 19 corpus is the principal data source for our submission. split qname input Query By Entity Name Y N n qent_name True if Y qname. We conducted a prospective study to analyze changes in TIM 3 PD 1 and their ligands galectin 9 PD L1 expression by peripheral blood T cell subpopulations NK cell subpopulations and monocytes by multicolor flow cytometry in 14 CHC patients successfully treated with 12 weeks of dasabuvir ombitasvir and paritaprevir ritonavir plus ribavirin. The edges are weighted where the edge weight denote the strength of association correlation strength in this network between the entity pair. We describe the first use of pocapavir in treating a case of severe neonatal enteroviral sepsis due to Coxsackievirus B3. This freely available dataset is provided to the global research community via this Kaggle challenge to apply recent advances in natural language processing NLP and other related techniques to generate insights in support of the ongoing fight against this infectious disease. While these did not adversely affect the overall quality of TCS _COVID _NETWORK a few false positives were observed. Analysis of Novel Drug Predictions for COVID 19The top 40 link predicted drugs for COVID 19 in the network are shown in Figure 3. Retain only those entities in the neighbourhood that appear in a multi hop simple path no more than 3 hops from covid 19 to baricitinib. Hence searching the network for these entity types can be done preferably through querying using term name rather than IDs as few of the network entities have only internal IDs and no public IDs. The obtained data allow to recommend ingavirin for prevention of recurrent herpetic stomatitis. INTRODUCTIONSince the outbreak of the COVID 19 pandemic there has been a massive pursuit by the research community to find drugs to treat this disease as well as discover vaccines against the disease. Our goal is to help the medical research community uncover these unknown known entities through a combination of text mining and network analyses. TPX Biomedical literature search made easy. These cases are by no means exhaustive. NER AnnotatorWe used lexicon dictionary based NER annotator to tag the text. png attachment Kaggle_pipeline_initial. Towards this we perform network exploration around some of these link predicted drugs to understand their possible mechanisms. Copy the Below code into a code cell to execute it offline on your desktop laptop. Inhibition of JAK suppresses the activation of cytokine signalling pathways involved in inflammation and joint destruction in rheumatoid arthritis. These permissions are granted for free by Elsevier for as long as the COVID 19 resource centre remains active. Based on our evaluation we found the correlations computed at the paragraph level to strike a good balance of precision and recall. In the subsequent releases we would be broadening the scope of the network and also be incorporating weight normalizations based on a more comprehensive collection of articles. Normalize it upper case Fetch the network Fetch the network Normalize it upper case Get the entity triplet for the entities Update Entity Name to Entity Node ID for reference Use the criteria to query the network by entity name Display only inferred edges Query by entity types Display only Top k entites Build Node attributes node_id node_label node_title node_color Build src node Build target node Build edge attributes Define Network layout Convert networkx G to pyvis network Filter1 Connected nodes Get the sub graph after applying the filter s Filter2 indirect_links Traverse k hops from source to target nodes. not in the corpus mentions Paritaprevir as a potential drug COVID 19 thus showing the potential value of inference For detailed analysis please refer to our chemrxiv submission at https chemrxiv. png APPROACH DETAILS Corpus preprocessing and augmentation CORD 19 corpus preprocessing As part of the corpus preprocessing we removed unwanted characters such as white spaces and html codes. Future submissions would provide enhancements to improve the overall quality. We investigate these drugs as potential drug re purposing candidates for COVID 19. Only Foreign Language Articles were excluded from the corpus. Our goal here is to illustrate the potential of the network and also enable domain experts to explore the network to generate their own hypotheses. This second sentence also gives us Azithromycin mitochondrial ribosomes Azithromycin MRPS27 and Nsp8 MRPS27 edges Finally viral replication COVID 19 is got from the paragraph. An important aspect to be noted is the absence of normalization when building this network resulting in a potential bias. Rao A Vg S Joseph T Kotte S Sivadasan N Srinivasan R. While this too remains to be demonstrated we note that Azithromycin has off target activity against human mitochondrial ribosomes components of which interact with the SARS CoV 2 Nsp8 protein MRPS5 MRPS27 MRPS2 and MRPS25. At a specific level it means we have to help uncover unknown known entities such as drugs and vaccines that are maybe unknown to the larger set of researchers but mentioned in specific scientific article s part of the CORD 19 dataset. was included at the begining of 380 articles sourced from Elsevier in the corpus. The Figure below depicts the overall approach. To answer specific as well as general questions pertinent to this task. Using Sub Networks to understand Drug mechanisms and Disease actionWe now show the utility of connections between different entity types using sub networks. Here the biological entities are the nodes and the pair wise correlations are represented using undirected weighted edges where the edge weight corresponds to the correlation strength. Prominent alternative medicines such as Astragali radix Shufeng jiedu and Lianhuaqingwen. However such novel links are equally crucial in identifying important drugs genes etc. We had previously developed a graph convolution based association inferencing algorithm GCAS Graph Convolution based Association Scoring in the context of network based study of rare diseases 3.

The network is compatible with the NetworkX package. Provide an intuitive and interactive graphical exploration of the network using PyVis. Arbidol Supported by PMID 32147628 PMID 32171872 CORD_UID zwqci59h CORD_UID 5pfusktn PMID 32037389 CORD_UID 7e8zlt3t PMID 32147628 Several drugs such as chloroquine arbidol remdesivir and favipiravir are currently undergoing clinical studies to test their efficacy and safety in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID 19 in China some promising results have been achieved thus far. Incorrectly annotated COVID19 articles We found that the sentence publicly funded repositories such as the WHO COVID database with rights for unrestricted research re use and analyses in any form or by any means with acknowledgement of the original source. Our network augmentation task is a step in this direction. Let s take the example where we look for connections between the drug azithromycin non structural proteins Nsp8 Nsp15 human mitochondrial ribosomal protein S27 MRPS27 and their possible role in viral repliction viral genome replication Correlations from the full text article 38d6gb7o from the CORD 19 corpus show Azithromycin COVID 19 Similarly antibiotics like azithromycin have also been mooted as treatments for COVID 19. Text and network mining techniques are employed to build a comprehensive network of relations between a vast variety of biological entities. The Jupyter notebook provides details on this. APPROACH SUMMARY Association Network CreationWe had earlier built a framework for NLP called TPX a web based text mining tool that supports real time entity assisted search and navigation of the MEDLINE repository whilst continuing to use PubMed as the underlying search engine 1. org articles Text_and_Network Mining_for_COVID 19_Intervention_Studies 12234564 Query the CoNetz with your own Queries The Code below accepts user s input and build the search criteria. Only entity types HGNC DRUGS GENE_SARS CoV 2 ORGANISM CHEMICALS VIROLOGY TERMS DISEASE 1. We however exhibit its use through some interesting use cases. The network nodes correspond to the biological entities and the edges correspond to the associations. This shows the presence of high quality association neighbors in the network within the top K neighborhood. This is because the provided corpus is highly specific to COVID 19 disease articles. User can identify a network node biological entity either by its term name or the entity ID in its source DB The ID here is its public ID as present in the public data source from which its source dictionary was built. R 125489 laninamivir PMID 28869418 says Laninamivir octanoate is a recently developed inhaled neuraminidase inhibitor for treating influenza virus infection PMID 30935767 says Four neuraminidase NA inhibitors and an RNA synthesis inhibitor were recently approved and are currently in clinical use for influenza. Many of these articles are actually not relevant to COVID 19 and seem to have come into the corpus because of this one sentence. We encourage the community to leverage the power of this network and its easy to use Python interface for this task and beyond. These probability values are estimated from the corpus. This network can is queried to obtain information and pointers from the corpus. The efficacy of some promising antivirals convalescent plasma transfusion and tocilizumab needs to be investigated by ongoing clinical trials. upper else Falseprint Enter Optional parameters tgt_qt input t Please enter the target Entity Types separted by comma n tent_types tgt_qt. PMID 28680834 says DAAs inhibit specific HCV non structural proteins NS that are vital for its replication. Hence in order to query for ACE2 one could either search using the the common term name ACE2 or its HGNC ID HGNC 13557.
