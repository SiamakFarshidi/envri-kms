Kaggle Secrets 1. The projects page https wandb. gif Highlights Train Anywhere The W B dashboard is centralized whether you re training on a local machine lab cluster or spot instances in the cloud all of your results get logged to a single place. It helps a lot in managing and tracking experiments during rapid prototyping and development by enabling advanced monitoring and visualization of ML processes with minimal integration effort. com open mmlab mmcv blob master mmcv runner hooks checkpoint. As Kaggle notebooks do not allow running aditional scripts in parallel or hosting pages for logging which is required in Tensorboard or other IPython tools Weights Biases seems to be the most viable option for monitoring training live while it is in progress. The LR is divided by 8 since the config file is originally for 8 GPUs The policy of scheduler also support CosineAnnealing Cyclic etc. Visualize Seamlessly Add W B s lightweight integration to your existing ML code and quickly get live metrics terminal logs and system stats streamed to the centralized dashboard. It will ask for the API key which can be copied and pasted to authenticate. Refer to details of supported LrUpdater from https github.
