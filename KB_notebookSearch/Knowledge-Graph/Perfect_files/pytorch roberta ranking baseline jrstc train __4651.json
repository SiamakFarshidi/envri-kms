Thanks About This Notebook This notebook tried to demonstrate the use of Transfer learning using the Huggingface and Pytorch library. Expected OutcomeIn this competition we will be ranking comments in order of severity of toxicity. I might update parts of it down the line when I get more GPU hours and some interesting ideas. Inference can be found in the notebook link below. Hopefully the solutions contribute towards controlling this behaviour so that the internet remains a safe place for everyone. If you found this notebook useful or use parts of it in your work please don t forget to show your appreciation by upvoting this kernel. com manabendrarout jrstc pytorch roberta ranking baseline infer Get GPU Info Imports Reading File Text Cleaning CFG Dataset Scheduler Metrics NLP Model Training And Validation Loops 1. I hope you have learnt something from this notebook. Grading MetricSubmissions are evaluated on Average Agreement with Annotators. We use MarginRankingLoss as our loss function. We use a vanilla roberta base transformer model for extracting language embeddings and pass them through a dense head to find the rankings. Pairs of comments can be and often are rated by more than one annotator and may have been ordered differently by different annotators. However we are provided a set of paired toxicity rankings as per expert raters that can be used to validate models. That keeps me motivated and inspires me to write and share such public kernels. I have created this notebook as a baseline model which you can easily fork and paly around with to get much better results. Problem StatementBuild a model that produces scores that rank each pair of comments the same way as the professional raters in the training dataset. For the ground truth annotators were shown two comments and asked to identify which of the two was more toxic. Online bullying has become a epidemic with the boom in connectivity. We are given a list of comments and each comment should be scored according to their relative toxicity. Validate Function RunThis is a simple starter kernel on implementation of Transfer Learning using Pytorch for this problem. Comments with a higher degree of toxicity should receive a higher numerical value compared to comments with a lower degree of toxicity. Huggingface transformers library has many SOTA NLP models which you can try out using the guidelines in this notebook. We can refer to previous Jigsaw competitions for data that might be useful to train models. Data DescriptionThere is no training data for this competition. Inference Notebook https www. Why this competition As evident from the problem statement this competition presents an unique challenge for a greater purpose. This notebook only covers the training part.
