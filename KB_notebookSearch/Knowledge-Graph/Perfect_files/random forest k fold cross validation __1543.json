First let s aggregate the features coming from the credit bureau file in the main loans table. Plot ROC for each K Fold compute AUC scores. Random Forest model K Fold cross validation Example sample of 3 loans Min payment for all previous loans Example SK_ID_CURR 365597 Sum and mean of minimum payments across all previous loans Example SK_ID_CURR 365597 Example SK_ID_CURR 365597 Initialize useful lists the plot axes. We fill the missing values with their average. Plot the mean ROC. Home Credit loans data model https storage. Finally let s add all the base features from the main loan table which don t need aggregation. Then we merge the aggregates of all minimum installment payments across all previous loans. Fine tune and show the plot. Plot the luck line. Loans data modelIt s good to keep in mind Home Credit loans data model to know how to join the different tables. A K Fold cross validation is used to avoid overfitting. png Read data Features selectionThe feature selection has been done using the most important features resulting of Will Koehrsen automated features generation https www. com willkoehrsen applied automated feature engineering basics notebook. Plot the standard deviation around the mean ROC. To do so We compute first the minimum of installment payments in the previous applications table. Home Credit Default Risk Random Forest K Fold Cross ValidationThis notebook shows a simple random forest approach to the Home Credit Default Risk problem. Next let s generate the features coming from the installments data. com kaggle media competitions home credit home_credit. com and Deep Feature Synthesis http www. The rational is to catch the loans where one payment has been missed or was very low. com static papers DSAA_DSM_2015.
