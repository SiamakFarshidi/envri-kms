BackgroundSince this is my first object detection competition in Kaggle I am mainly using it for learning. Finetuuning the model Defining the modelFaster R CNN is a model that predicts both bounding boxes and class scores for potential objects in the image. There are great kernel here mostly using the FastRCNN model And I have learned how to prepare the data and use it with this popular model. IF you like this kernel Please upvote IntroductionWelcome to the Global Wheat Detection competition In this competition contestent will detect wheat heads from outdoor images of wheat plants including wheat datasets from around the globe. Writing a custom dataset for our work 2. org tutorials intermediate torchvision_tutorial. Part 3 Classes and Bounding Boxes prediction Now we use another Fully connected neural networks that takes as an inpt the regions proposed by the RPN and predict object class classification and Bounding boxes Regression. Using worldwide data contestent will focus on a generalized solution to estimate the number and size of wheat heads. Lets train our model 4. GREAT KERNEL BY nvnn https www. The other is when we want to replace the backbone of the model with a different one. Pretrained weight https www. The model considers class 0 as background. So for instance if one of the images has booth classes your labels tensor should look like 1 2. In our case number of classes are 2 class 0 for background and class 1 for wheat. com nvnnghia fasterrcnn pseudo labeling http 3. png attachment image. One note on the labels. read_csv Input data files are available in the read only. Define the model 4. There are two common situations where one might want to modify one of the available models in torchvision modelzoo. Writing a custom dataset for our work 3. input directory For example running this by clicking run or pressing Shift Enter will list all files under the input directory You can write up to 5GB to the current directory kaggle working that gets preserved as output when you create a version using Save Run All You can also write temporary files to kaggle temp but they won t be saved outside of the current session Drop unwanted columns There are total 3373 unique image in training dataset maximum number of boxes in a single image are 116 Minimum number of box in a single image is 1 in our desired formate Apply transform to image Apply transformation For test data Else for train and validation data there is only one class suppose all instances are not crowd split the dataset in train and test set load a model pre trained on COCO 1 class wheat background get number of input features for the classifier replace the pre trained head with a new one Load the trained weights Average out the loss update the learning rate Compare the score of output with the threshold and slelect only those boxes whose score is greater than threshold value Convert the box formate to Xmin Ymin W H Store the image id and boxes and scores in result dict. png Let s explain how this architecture works Faster RCNN is composed from 3 parts1. com kaggle docker python For example here s several helpful packages to load linear algebra data processing CSV file I O e. Lets plot some of our prediction Submission If you like this kernel Please upvote it This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed It is defined by the kaggle python Docker image https github. I have decided to build a learning kernel that at least at the beginning will explain the topic and the concepts the definition and the basics. Prediction Lets load the test data Set the threshold value for predicting bounding box. com faster rcnn object detection f865e5ed7fc4 Content 1. 1 Writing a custom dataset for train and validation images Lets visualize some of the images with bounding box 3. To better gauge the performance for unseen genotypes environments and observational conditions the training dataset covers multiple regions. Part 1 Convolution layers A CNN architecture is formed by a stack of distinct layers that transform the input volume into an output volume e. If your dataset does not contain the background class you should not have 0 in your labels. The receptive fields of different neurons partially overlap such that they cover the entire visual field. holding the class scores through a differentiable function. Individual cortical neurons respond to stimuli only in a restricted region of the visual field known as the receptive field. The test data includes about 1 000 images from Australia Japan and China. The first is when we want to start from a pre trained model and just finetune the last layer. Fast RCNN https towardsdatascience. com mathurinache fasterrcnn http 4. For example assuming you have just two classes cat and dog you can define 1 not 0 to represent cats and 2 to represent dogs. contestent will use more than 3 000 images from Europe France UK Switzerland and North America Canada. Append the result dict to Results list. EDA Install and import necessary libraries Load train and test file Splitting the dimension of box in the formate xmin ymin w h Latter on we will convert the deminsion of box into xmin ymin xmax ymax in Splitting the data into train and validation set 2. Convolutional networks were inspired by biological processes in that the connectivity pattern between neurons resembles the organization of the animal visual cortex. I will explain every important code line. PYTORCH TORCHVISION OBJECT DETECTION FINETUNING TUTORIAL https pytorch. Finetuning from a pretrained model 5. In our case we want to fine tune from a pre trained model given that our dataset is very small so we will be following approach number first.
