We going to use all following features for further analysis. So this features should be coded by integer values further. 2384186 \u00b5V and a range of 2. This is how the stakeholders want to see the results of predictions on the test datasetAs we can see below features are numerical values except experiment and event. Diverted Attention DA is the state of having one s attention diverted by actions or thought processes associated with a decision. The sensor had a resolution bit of. time y_pred clf_3. com c reducing commercial aviation fatalities data Data understanding The aim of this stage is to illuminate some relation between features by plotting or simple modelling. The training set contains three experiments one for each state in which the pilots experienced just one of the states.

A measure of electrodermal activity. So further normalization we will apply only to the train dataset. The data are provided in microvolts. Normalize data by pilotsIt should be noted we going to use train dataset for both train and test model. ensemble import BaggingClassifier import time n_estimators 3 start time. In a nutshell we can resume following resultsthere are no NAN s values in the data all features eeg ecg raspiration have similar distribution in the train and test datasets there is need in some normalization method because of different feature ranges Data preparation Objective of this stage is to prepare data for model. In this dataset we re given three main physiological parameters Respiration r Electrocardiogram ECG Electroencephalogram EEG Galvanic Skin Response gsr For each experiment a pair of pilots each with its own crew id was recorded over time and subjected to the CA DA or SS cognitive states. This is induced in benchmarking by having the subjects play an engaging puzzle based video game. time clf_3 OneVsRestClassifier BaggingClassifier SVC kernel linear probability True class_weight balanced max_samples 1. Startle Surprise SS is induced by having the subjects watch movie clips with jump scares. To obtain data set in the one range mark category values with integer numbers.

RespirationA measure of the rise and fall of the chest. show start time. Data Description The aim is to develop model to predict event by physiological data from eighteen pilots who were subjected to various distracting events. This is induced by having the subjects perform a display monitoring task. time clf_4 KNeighborsClassifier n_neighbors 3 clf_4 clf_4. K Nearest Neighbours5. Galvanic Skin Response.

For example running this by clicking run or pressing Shift Enter will list all files under the input directory Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output. show f1_score f1_score y_test y_pred average weighted print f1_score f1_score. Target Experiment The pilots experienced distractions intended to induce one of the following three cognitive states Channelized Attention CA is roughly speaking the state of being focused on one task to the exclusion of all others. The benchmark training set is comprised of a set of controlled experiments collected in a non flight environment outside of a flight simulator. The galvanic skin response GSR which falls under the umbrella term of electrodermal activity or EDA refers to changes in sweat gland activity that are reflective of the intensity of our emotional state otherwise known as emotional arousal. read_csv Input data files are available in the. Train Test splittingAs we had seen there is different counts of the observations by states. In such case for Train Test splitting better to use StratifiedShuffleSplit method for proportional splitting by all classesSplitting datasets plot Modelling Coding categorical features event by integersLets consider following models 1. multiclass import OneVsRestClassifier from sklearn. So dataset is disbalanced. print f1_score f1_score from sklearn. Periodically a math problem showed up which had to be solved before returning to the monitoring task.
