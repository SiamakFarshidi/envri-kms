have good one all ", "stargazers_count": 0, "forks_count": 0, "description": "Then we import loads of sklearn modules. The Minimum Covariance Determinant MCD method is a highly robust estimator of multivariate location and scatter for which a fast algorithm is available. Elliptic EnvelopeLet s try another automatic outlier detection method. At 3D we can have this scatterplot showing us some kind of meaningful clusters. Put the result into a color plot Plot the training points Plot the testing points Displaying confusion matrix for each estimator. 80 Learning Curves Before finalizing our modelling I wanted to use another tool sklearn offers Learning Curves. Rest ECG results showing no direct results but having normal ECG is pretty good sign. The advantages of support vector machines are Effective in high dimensional spaces. Meanwhile it s less than half for not having it. com ronitf heart disease uci discussion 105877 his points made sense so I decided to use this dataset after inspecting it Heart Disease Cleveland UCI https www. Isolation Forest The IsolationForest isolates observations by randomly selecting a feature and then randomly selecting a split value between the maximum and minimum values of the selected feature. Basically I tried to show distribution of data relations between variables and target as well as correlations between each other then did some basic model building. Discretization Discretization otherwise known as quantization or binning provides a way to partition continuous features into discrete values. RandomizedSearchCV implements a randomized search over parameters where each setting is sampled from a distribution over possible parameter values. Versatile different Kernel functions can be specified for the decision function. Here s the fun part who doesn t love a bit of modelling We start by loading our train data and labels as X and y s and we get dummy variables for categorical data using one hot encoding. Let s get building them. The deeper the tree the more complex the decision rules and the fitter the model. It looks like these 5 explains half of the variance in our data. This model optimizes the log loss function using LBFGS or stochastic gradient descent. GBDT is an accurate and effective off the shelf procedure that can be used for both regression and classification problems in a variety of areas including Web search ranking and ecology. I ll do small quotes for each classifier from sklearn s official page GradientBoostingClassifier Gradient Tree Boosting or Gradient Boosted Decision Trees GBDT is a generalization of boosting to arbitrary differentiable loss functions. One last note I used some sklearn features just for the sake of showing them they might be not needed in actual use for this case. Multivariate Analysis Multivariate analysis MVA is based on the principles of multivariate statistics which involves observation and analysis of more than one statistical outcome variable at a time. Cholesterol Max Heart Rate Age St Depression vs Target Here I tried to fit every single numerical feature into one graph so we can have some visualized version of the effects. The data includes 303 patient level features including if they have heart disease at the end or not. Having defected thalium test results is pretty strong indicator for heart disease. 5 Components We start with 5 components. Number of unique train observartions Renaming cateorical data for easier understanding Masks for easier selection in future Display categorical data Displaying numeric distribution Categorical data vs condition Displaying numeric distribution vs condition Numeric data vs each other and condition 3D scatterplot of numeric data Loading data for corrmap Correlation heatmap between variables Top correlated variables vs condition Setting train and condition data One hot encoding train features Loading sklearn packages Selecting some sklearn classifiers Setting 5 fold CV Baseline check Feature importances Applying Isolation Forest Checking isolated models Applying Elliptical Envelope Applying K bins discretizer Plot learning curve Displaying learning curves Searching parameters for fine tuning Checking binned models Fitting PCA Explaining variance ratio 5 Component PCA Displaying 50 of the variance 3 Component PCA Project from 46 to 3 dimensions. That can show us how fast the models learning and especially how is the model doing with the number of data given so we can decide if more data needed for better results. Classification is computed from a simple majority vote of the nearest neighbors of each point a query point is assigned the data class which has the most representatives within the nearest neighbors of the point. For this part we going to inspect how s the data distribution is and what patterns we can inspect. Lastly older patients are more likely to have heart disease. Reduced Dimension Model Results These are pretty good results We almost have same model metrics for most of the classifiers and even got some better regularization for some estimators Decision Regions With these contour plots we can see how the models decide on their predictions based on 2D data with confidence intervals. com cherngs heart disease cleveland uci. Again renaming the categorical variables for easier EDA interpretation. In this part we goin to take our variables and compare them against our target condition which is if the observed patient has disease or not. I m going to choose small amount of estimators and not many parameters to search for timing purposes but you ll see even that s useful Tuned Model Results Alright As you can see even little bit tuned parameters added regularization to our models and increased the CV score for them. Having exercise induced angina is pretty strong indicator for heart disease patients are almost 3 times more likely to have disease if they have exercise induced angina. Thankfully sklearn is coming to help with useful tools for this case too We going to use RandomizedSearchCV for this While using a grid of parameter settings is currently the most widely used method for parameter optimization other search methods have more favourable properties. But I wanted to use what sklearn can offer us for this so we gonna try couple sklearn features. Uses a subset of training points in the decision function called support vectors so it is also memory efficient. So it s safe to reduce some. Most common ches pain type is Asymptomatic ones which is almost 50 of the data 85 of the patients has no high levels of fastin blood sugar. I d say it gave me more reasonable results and decided to stick with it both datasets are pretty close but targets are reversed. RandomizedSearchCV Let s get rid of overfitting one of the easiest ways of doing it is tuning parameters for our estimators and regularize them. Even though it s pretty rare in the data if you ST T wave abnormality you are 3 times more likely to have heart disease. Blood sugar has no direct effect on the disease. Cholesterol Serum Cholesterol in mg dl Fasting Blood Sugar 0 Less Than 120mg ml 1 Greater Than 120mg ml Resting Electrocardiographic Measurement 0 Normal 1 ST T Wave Abnormality 2 Left Ventricular Hypertrophy Max Heart Rate Achieved Maximum Heart Rate Achieved Exercise Induced Angina 1 Yes 0 No ST Depression ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest. Chest pain type is very subjective and has no direct relation on the outcome asymptomatic chest pains having highest disease outcome. Basically I set contamination rate of our data to 10 and dropped them using masks. I find max heart rate distribution a bit interesting expecting the other way around but it might be due to testing conditions and if you have normal results on ECG while exercising instructors might be increasing your excercise density It s pretty clear that heart disease likelihood increases with ST depression levels. Since our decision tree based models overfitting I wanted to look which features are most effecting these decisions I sampled two of the tree based models you can see below Automatic Outlier Detection Before going to tune our models I decided to get rid of some outliers we have pretty small database and we can actually remove them by hand or more basic methods. Slope Slope of the peak exercise ST segment 0 Upsloping 1 Flat 2 Downsloping Thalassemia A blood disorder called Thalassemia 0 Normal 1 Fixed Defect 2 Reversable Defect Number of Major Vessels Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy. Features are like Age Obvious one. Bivariate analysis can be helpful in testing simple hypotheses of association. Random partitioning produces noticeably shorter paths for anomalies. It s important for this case since we don t want our models to predict no disease on actually unhealty person or vice versa. GaussianNB GaussianNB implements the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm for classification. Reducing dimensions is useful for bigger datasets because by transforming a large set of variables into a smaller one that still contains most of the information in the large set makes your modelling faster. So we want less false positives and negatives but don t forget we still have some overfitted models so be careful about checking overfitted models like decision tree etc. Inspecting Age Closer Correlations We going to use pearson correlation for to find linear relations between features heatmap is decent way to show these relations. It d be very bad for patients in actual use. Again there are some outliers espacially a strong one in Cholesterol worth to take a look later. The likelihood of the features is assumed to be Gaussian. On 2D space we can still diverse the clusters according to our target variables. MLP Classifier Multi layer Perceptron classifier. In scikit learn PCA is implemented as a transformer object that learns components in its fit method and can be used on new data to project it on these components. Number of major vessels observed seems on similar levels for patients who have disease but 0 observations is good sign for not having disease. But we can see most of our decision tree based models are overfitting that s something we should take a look at soon. Univariate Analysis Univariate analysis is the simplest form of analyzing data. Resing electrocardiographic observations are evenly distributed between normal and left ventricular hypertrophy with ST T minority 67 of the patients had no exercise induced angina Peak exercise slope seems mainly divided between upsloping and flat. Feel free to comment I ll try to answer it all and as usual if you liked my work please don t forget to vote have good one all Loading packages. These two components explains almost one third of the variance. Displaying 3 components 2 Component PCA project from 46 to 2 dimensions Displaying 2 PCA Reduced Dimension Model Results preprocess dataset split into training and test part Just plot the dataset first Iterate over classifiers Plot the decision boundary. By looking at the results binning improved some models little but few of them like SVC got huge boost to their score. Looking at our first results showing RandomForestClassifier is the best performing one in the list of not tuned classifiers followed by MLP and GradientBoosting classifiers. Adding parameters that do not influence the performance does not decrease efficiency. Since recursive partitioning can be represented by a tree structure the number of splittings required to isolate a sample is equivalent to the path length from the root node to the terminating node. It didn t do great on the results we have pretty small dataset and removing some more damaging model performances probably. That s a good sign Now we have three decent models to make predictions Dimension Reduction Using PCA PCA is used to decompose a multivariate dataset in a set of successive orthogonal components that explain a maximum amount of the variance. 3D scatterplot is great tool for doing that. Baseline Results We have many metrics but I decided to sort them by F1 score since precision and recall is pretty important on this case. Since we have small and noisy data I thougt binning them would be better choice of action for this purpose I m going to choose another sklearn tool K Bbins Discretization This method discretizes features into k bins. It involves the analysis of two variables for the purpose of determining the empirical relationship between them. Final Words Well this concludes my notebook. Both algorithms are perturb and combine technique specifically designed for trees. Bivariate Analysis Bivariate analysis is one of the simplest forms of quantitative analysis. This means a diverse set of classifiers is created by introducing randomness in the classifier construction. RandomForestClassifier The sklearn. Typically MVA is used to address the situations where multiple measurements are made on each experimental unit and the relations among these measurements and their structures are important. Numerical Data vs Target Here we can do these observations Having higher resting blood pressure shows you are little bit more likely to have heart disease. AdaBoostClassifier An AdaBoost classifier is a meta estimator that begins by fitting a classifier on the original dataset and then fits additional copies of the classifier on the same dataset but where the weights of incorrectly classified instances are adjusted such that subsequent classifiers focus more on difficult cases. Looks cool Confusion Matrix One last thing before we finish our sklearn journey I wanted to use another cool sklearn tool to show confusion matrices for each model. Categorical Data Here we can do these observations Males on the dataset is more than double of the female observations. One hot encoded discretized features can make a model more expressive while maintaining interpretability. Hence when a forest of random trees collectively produce shorter path lengths for particular samples they are highly likely to be anomalies. Again same for Cholesterol it s not strong indicator but patients are little bit more likely to have disease with high cholesterol. Patients who had flat slope distribution are more likely to have disease. On X axis we have Cholesterol levels on Y Max Heart Rate presented and Z axis is patient Age marker sizes are based on ST_Depression levels and coloring based on the patient condition. After doing some usual exploratory data analysis I noticed some of the results doesn t make sense I ain t no expert in field but made me curious and then I found this topic here The ultimate guide to this dataset https www. It also serves as a convenient and efficient tool for outlier detection. Sklearn module takes several strategy parameters but we going to use kmeans strategy which defines bins based on a k means clustering procedure performed on each feature independently. For that we will assign a color to each point in the mesh x_min x_max x y_min y_max. Numerical Data Most of the continuous variables somewhat close to gaussian distribution with small skews left or right except for oldpeak. Disabling warnings Styling Seeding Reading csv file Taking random samples from data Checking null values Renaming columns. In our case we can see that some models overfitting and most of our models can get better with the more data. For instance pre processing with a discretizer can introduce nonlinearity to linear models. We assumed our distribution close to gaussian while inspecting the data so elliptic envelope worth to take a look. Explained Variance This graph shows that first 15 components explains more than 80 of the variance in the data and currently we have 46 of them. Uni means one so in other words your data has only one variable. Here I chose top related features with outcome condition seems thal is the most correlated one. ensemble module includes two averaging algorithms based on randomized decision trees the RandomForest algorithm and the Extra Trees method. Well let s get goin then Loading Data I decided to rename columns for easier understanding in EDA part. It was fun sklearn journey for me I hope you had fun while reading it and thanks for taking a look. The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features. It doesn t deal with causes or relationships unlike regression and it s major purpose is to describe It takes data summarizes that data and finds patterns in the data. Introduction Hello all In this notebook I tried to play with some sklearn features while exploring and visualizing the heart disease data we have given. This path length averaged over a forest of such random trees is a measure of normality and our decision function. Support Vector Machines Support vector machines SVMs are a set of supervised learning methods used for classification regression and outliers detection. Certain datasets with continuous features may benefit from discretization because discretization can transform the dataset of continuous attributes to one with only nominal attributes. It s up to you what dataset you choose the original one gave me better F1 score but as I said EDA didn t make sense to but I have to tell I m just inspecting the data and have no medical knowledge on the field. Still effective in cases where number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples. There s is also one outlier there with no disease pretty interesting. Classifiers Here I selected some common sklearn classifiers I didn t want to include some common ml algorithms like xgboost lightgbm or catboost since I wanted to play with sklearn only for this notebook. KNeighborsClassifier Neighbors based classification is a type of instance based learning or non generalizing learning it does not attempt to construct a general internal model but simply stores instances of the training data. Common kernels are provided but it is also possible to specify custom kernels. This is not the case here since we have very small data but we still can use it for visualization which I find it cool. 3 Components More we reduce dimensions further we can visualize it better for our graphs. Decision trees learn from data to approximate a sine curve with a set of if then else decision rules. This has two main benefits over an exhaustive search A budget can be chosen independent of the number of parameters and possible values. DecisionTreeClassifier Decision Trees DTs are a non parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. Sex 0 Female 1 Male Chest Pain Type 0 Typical Angina 1 Atypical Angina 2 Non Anginal Pain 3 Asymptomatic Resting Blood Pressure Person s resting blood pressure. The prediction of the ensemble is given as the averaged prediction of the individual classifiers. This one did a little bit better than isolation forest so let s stick with it for this case. Categorical Data vs Target Here we can do these observations Males are much more likely for heart diseases.
