Since the majority of this dataset contains orders from the UK we can explore the UK market further analysis by finding out what products the customers buy together and any other buying behaviors to improve our sales and targeting strategy. You can use the logarithm method to normalize the values in a column. K means has also been widely used for market segmentation and has the advantage of being simple to implement. com exploratory data analysis with pandas profiling de3aae2ddff3 https analyticsindiamag. StockCode Product item code. Importing Related Libraries. We will try different cluster numbers and check their silhouette coefficient http scikit learn. To calculate recency we need to choose a date as a point of reference to evaluate how many days ago was the customer s last purchase. Create a new column called Date which contains the invoice date without the timestamp. You could also call it customer churn analysis. In SilhouetteVisualizer plots clusters with higher scores have wider silhouettes but clusters that are less cohesive will fall short of the average score across all clusters which is plotted as a vertical dotted red line. 5 then the dataset is not clusterable. 1 A General Look at the Data 4. You will use this function to extract the integer values for Invoice as well as Cohort Date in 3 seperate series for each of the two columnsUse the variables created above to calcualte the difference in days and store them in cohort Index column.
