This is one such example. field2token method is generic and can be used in any similar situation. In this section we list the short cuts and reverse indices that are added to the NuScenes class during initialization. We provide a data key to access these Notice that the keys are referring to the different sensors that form our sensor suite. list_categories lists all categories counts and statistics of width length height in meters and aspect ratio. You can apply your data analysis skills in this competition to advance the state of self driving technology. com timzhang642 3D Machine Learning https towardsdatascience. scene 25 45 seconds snippet of a car s journey. Instead the sample_annotation table points to a record in the instance table. field2token method but that is slow and inconvenient. instance Enumeration of all object instance we observed. NOTE These methods use OpenCV for rendering which doesn t always play nice with IPython Notebooks. It also has a token field which is a unique record identifier. sample_submission. Memory The map can e. Additionally we can aggregate the point clouds from multiple sweeps to get a denser point cloud. list_scenes lists all scenes in the loaded DB. Let s look at a scene s metadata 2. be displayed in the background of top down views I don t run this we need more RAM. Thanks rishabhiitbhu for this comment https www. Since the record is a dictionary the token can be accessed like so If you know the token for any record in the DB you can retrieve the record by doing_As you can notice we have recovered the same record _OK that was easy. This points to the instance table. If you want to learn more about this please check the post Some important links to get started https www. csv contains all sample_tokens in the test set with empty predictions. Here we list the provided attributes and the number of annotations associated with a particular attribute. Autonomous vehicles are expected to redefine transportation and unlock a myriad of societal environmental and economic benefits. In addition it has several fields of the format a z _token _e. You may also need the train. sensor A specific sensor type. These are meant both as convenience methods during development and as tutorials for building your own visualization methods. This dataset features the raw sensor camera inputs as perceived by a fleet of multiple high end autonomous vehicles in a restricted geographic area. render_scene which renders the video for all camera channels. zip and test_lidar. This also has a token field they all do. A keyframe is a frame where the time stamps of data from all the sensors should be very close to the time stamp of the sample it points to. com xhlulu lyft quick eda and creating useful files by xhlulu Official Devkit for the public 2019 Lyft Level 5 AV Dataset https github. Reverse indicesThe devkit adds two reverse indices by default. Let us look at an example. This in turn points to a record in the category table where finally the name fields stores the required information. Dataset and Devkit BasicsLet s get a bit technical. Let s check the number of logs and the metadata of a log. If you look carefully at the tables you will see that the sample_annotation table points to the instance table but the instance table doesn t list all annotations that point to it. zip are in JSON format. zip and test_maps. Let s store these in a set for nowThe level5data. Introduction to the dataset structureIn this part of the tutorial let us go through a top down introduction of our database. log Log information from which the data was extracted. ShortcutsThe sample_annotation table has a category_name shortcut. ContinueI ll keep adding stuff here mainly EDA and Visualization. So how can we recover all sample_annotations for a particular object instance There are two ways 1. InstanceObject instance are instances that need to be detected or tracked by an AV e. json train_maps. com SmartLabAI 3d object detection from lidar data with deep learning 95f6d400399a https github. g a particular vehicle pedestrian. In this competition you will build and optimize algorithms based on a large scale dataset. ego_pose ego_pose contains information about the location encoded in translation and the orientation encoded in rotation of the ego vehicle body frame with respect to the global coordinate system. This way we can connect all annotations of a particular object. These are foreign keys in database speak meaning they point to another table. A category record contains the name and the description of that particular category. sample_annotation An annotated instance of an object within our interest. Each table is a list of records and each record is a dictionary. I modified the code for running it here and I ll add new stuff. But there are plenty of situations where you have a log and want to find the corresponding map So what to do You can always use the level5data. RenderFirst let s plot a lidar point cloud in an image. logThe log table contains log information from which the data was extracted. By conducting a competition we hope to encourage the research community to focus on hard problems in this space namely 3D object detection over semantic maps. A log record corresponds to one journey of our ego vehicle along a predefined route. zip and test_data. Let s examine its metadata click output A useful method is list_sample which lists all related sample_data keyframes and sample_annotation associated with a sample which we will discuss in detail in the subsequent parts. Let s try something harder. This table enumerate the object _instances_ we have encountered in each scene. Check the official repository for more impormation. The sample_annotation table doesn t hold this information since the category is an instance level constant. These are all created in the NuScenes. They are implemented in the NuScenesExplorer class with shortcuts through the NuScenes class itself. Further there are situations where one needs to go through several tables to get a certain piece of information. Since it is quite common to want to know the category name of an annotation we add a category_name field to the sample_annotation table during initialization of the NuScenes class. png This dataset aims to democratize access to such data and foster innovation in higher level autonomy functions for everyone everywhere. Lyft 3D Object Detection for Autonomous Vehicles Self driving technology presents a rare opportunity to improve the quality of life in many of our communities. field2token Reverse indexing and short cutsThe dataset tables are normalized meaning that each piece of information is only given once. There are two options here 1. We can also render an annotation to have a closer look. If everything is set up correctly you should be able to execute the following cell successfully. get we can grab any of these in constant time. org and was adjusted for the Level 5 AV dataset. For example there is one map record for each log record. A map_token field is added to the log records. Finally let us visualize all scenes on the map for a particular location. com the state of 3d object detection f65a385f67a8Also you can read about resources and experiences here new quota Competition Expectations experiences https www. SampleWe define sample as an annotated keyframe of a scene at a given timestamp. SensorThe Level 5 dataset consists of data collected from our full sensor suite which consists of 1 x LIDAR up to three in final dataset 7 x cameras Every sample_data has a record on which sensor the data is collected from note the channel key 9. We can also plot all annotations across all sample data for that sample. json train_lidar. Lyft Level 5 AV dataset and nuScenes devkit tutorial IMPORTANT This is a modification of the official devkit tutorial https github. com seshurajup lyft level 5 av dataset notebook from github 625566 1. zip and test_images. Let s examine an example from our sample above. The data files test_data. render_scene renders the video for all surround view camera channels. Let s look at the sample_annotation table. However we do not track them across different scenes. In this example we have 16 annotated samples for this instance across a particular scene. For certain situation we provide some reverse indices in the tables themselves. SceneLet s take a look at the scenes that we have in the loaded database. Let s take a look at the metadata of a sample_data taken from CAM_FRONT. Calibrated_sensor calibrated_sensor consists of the definition of a particular sensor lidar camera as calibrated on a particular vehicle. with LIDAR_TOP The following call can be slow and requires a lot of memory Shortcut No shortcut The rendering command below is commented out because it tends to crash in notebooks level5data. AttributeAn attribute is a property of an instance that may change throughout different parts of a scene while the category remains the same. If you experience any issues please run these lines from the command line. com lyft nuscenes devkit. Let s try it This returns a list of all sample_annotation records with the instance_token one_instance token. csv which includes the sample annotations in the form expected for submissions. The correct dataset path contains at least the following four folders or similar images lidar maps v1. com kaggle media competitions Lyft Kaggle Kaggle 01. We can even render a specific annotation. list_sample method in the previous section for more details on this. com c 3d object detection for autonomous vehicles discussion 108613 latest 625428 https medium. Let s get started Make sure that you have a local copy of a dataset for download instructions see https level5. We can also render the sample_data at a particular sensor. calibrated sensor Definition of a particular sensor as calibrated on a particular vehicle. Looking at the schema you will notice that the map table has a log_token field but that the log table does not have a corresponding map_token field. All location data is given with respect to the global coordinate system. Notice that it contains a variety of information such as the date and location of the log collected. MapMap information is currently stored in a 2D rasterized image. For example the first record of the category table is stored at The category table is simple it holds the fields name and description. zip contains maps of the entire sample area. csv contains all sample_tokens in the train set as well as annotations in the required format for all train set objects. Now let us look at the first annotated sample in this scene. Let us examine an instance metadataWe generally track an instance across different frames in a particular scene. 1 train my_sample_token level5data. The most important is sample_data. There is also a method level5data. Recovering this record is easy. Finally let s assert that we recovered the same ann_records as we did using level5data. The sample_submission. attribute Property of an instance that can change while the category remains the same. An instance record takes note of its first and last annotation token. csv file contains all of the sample Ids for the test set. zip test_lidar. com c 3d object detection for autonomous vehicles discussion 108609 latest 625543 Load the SDK Load the dataset Adjust the dataroot parameter below to point to your local dataset path. __make_reverse_index__ method. get sample my_sample_token next proceed to next sample also try this e. json which contains the primary identifiers used in the competition as well as links to key image lidar information. References Lyft Quick EDA and creating useful files https www. Consider for example the category name of a sample_annotation. Instead of looking at camera and lidar data separately we can also project the lidar pointcloud into camera images 3. Welcome to the Level 5 AV dataset nuScenes SDK tutorial This notebook is based on the original nuScenes tutorial notebook https www. ego_pose Ego vehicle poses at a particular timestamp. Note that in our dataset we don t provide num_lidar_pts and set it to 1 to indicate this. sample_data Data collected from a particular sensor. zip contains JSON files with multiple tables. render_sample my_sample token. Note that one log can contain multiple non overlapping scenes. Our dataset comprises of elemental building blocks that are the following 1. Let s take a look at an example how an attribute may change over one scene 8. jpeg files corresponding to samples in sample_data. render_scene_channel renders the video for a particular channel. list_attributes lists all attributes and counts. category Taxonomy of object categories e. Sample_dataThe dataset contains data that is collected from a full sensor suite. The sample records have shortcuts to all sample_annotations for that record as well as sample_data key frames. visibility currently not used 9. Avoidable collisions single occupant commuters and vehicle emissions are choking cities while infrastructure strains under rapid urban growth. This example dataset only has one scene but there are many more to come. _Using shortcut __Not using shortcut _The sample_data table has channel and sensor_modality shortcuts Data VisualizationsWe provide list and rendering methods. zip train_data. List methodsThere are three list methods available. sample An annotated snapshot of a scene at a particular timestamp. Let s render them 6. Let s look at the category table we have in our database. Let s check the number of maps and metadata of a map. Now we can traverse all annotations of this instance using the next field. The NuScenes class holds several tables. Then adjust dataroot below to point to your local dataset path. Finally we can render a full scene as a video. The instance record has a field first_annotation_token which points to the first annotation in time of this instance. Lidar allows us to accurately map the surroundings in 3D. Note that the translation and the rotation parameters are given with respect to the ego vehicle body frame. It also gives out information about the map from where the data was collected. Or if we only want to render a particular sensor we can specify that. CategoryA category is the object assignment of an annotation. The devkit therefore adds reverse mappings for some common situations including this one. Sample_annotation sample_annotation refers to any bounding box defining the position of an object seen in a sample. Hence for each snapshot of a scene we provide references to a family of data that is collected from these sensors. com lyft nuscenes devkit by iglovikov DataYou will need the LIDAR image map and data files for both train and test test_images.
