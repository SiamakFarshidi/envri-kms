Also the team size is half the time bigger than 10 people however 40 of cases are in small teams of a maximum of 4 people. Moreover this graph is also a relief for beginners you don t necessarily need heavy computing power to be very good or earn well. Unfortunately points 2. com christofhenkel might agree with me as well. But let s discover what languages they use most what is their DS setup how do they deal with cloud and big data and what advice they have to share. Most of this 88 percent have never even tried TPUs before and if they did they only used it between 2 to 5 times. 100 The Pareto PrincipleOur McMeal units distribution match the Pareto Principle very well roughly 80 of consequences come from 20 of the causes https en. As for tools and methods even though one would expect some complicated answers they still use and rely the most on simple structures like Regressions Tree Based models Image Classification or Word Embeddings for NLP. Classification and General Image Methods like cv2 PIL or skimage are the most popular in the Computer Vision department. They also use cloud computing services like Google Cloud Datalab AI Platform but most excessively Colab or Kaggle Notebooks. Analysis at Work and DeploymentThe visualization and discussion below are representative for all 3 Pay Categories Regarding Deployment most of our top respondents prefer to either deploy on GitHub or keep their models locally on their personal gear. input 2020 cost of living pirate_patch. Some assumptions were. I know it helped me at least. Note From now on when I ll mention pay I will refer to the units we got after the pay normalization on the McMeal units 3. We can see that the respondents with High Pay are located in companies that spend much less on ML than the other 2 groups. We can say our map is already laid out in front of us well structured and ready but still empty hence we now need to follow the steps to our treasure. To conclude the top data scientists have similar behavior in terms of environments and IDE with the average Kaggler use the most the personal gear Colab and Kaggle Notebooks and work on a combination of Jupyter PyCharm and RStudio environments. This aspect might have significantly influenced the overall decision. Takeaway We ve learned that our high end respondents are usually Data Scientists or Software Machine Learning Engineers with lots of coding experience but not necessarily ML seniority. I would also believe that highly skilled people usually have very high pay and the exceptions from that rule aren t that many. org wiki Pareto_principle TPU vs GPU https analyticsindiamag. They come from large and small companies but the higher the investment and interest of the company in ML the higher the individual income received. Accelerators Yay or Nay First let s understand some concepts. What s the best setup The graphs below are about the same for all 3 Pay Categories Most work on their personal laptop computer. A reason for that could be the inclination towards old school coding as they might prefer writing everything from scratch going through the data the patterns and the models with their own hands instead of relying on a service. Respondents are split in half with very few exceptions 44 use no Acceleration while the other 44 use GPUs most often. There IS something to learn here. 05 offset 0 border 1 offset_png x 2. Most loved frameworks are Scikit learn Tensorflow and Matplotlib with no complicated or additional current preference for miscellaneous tools. Buckle up pirates the treasure hunt is ON. Dieter https www. Languages Used and Advice to CommunityMost coders secretly root for Python but are all the other languages obsolete Python is by far the most popular language in most areas both in usage and as a recommendation for future users. Afterward we can use the McMeal units as our non bias indicator. How long does it take to get there How hard do we need to work What job roles should we pursue For how long have they been practicing The most important points here These exceptional people have more coding experience than ML in terms of time. The top 2 countries for all categories are the USA and India. More than 50 of the respondents didn t respond altogether so only half remain available. tg c3ow border color 010307 text align center vertical align top Category Name Meaning Number of respondents High 10 000 20 000 units These people can buy more McMeals than more than 75 of our base users.

The Interest of the Company in Machine LearningThis question might have some bias because some people could have guessed a rough estimate as they might not know of the business side of the company. Takeaway We now know that the high end of respondents is mostly from the US and India but also located in Japan China Indonesia UK Russia or Canada and have a Male 30 45 yo profile. tg c3ow border color 010307 text align center vertical align top Criteria Value Strength Flaw Level of Education Masters Doctoral Majority of Grandmasters havesome level of upper education Many bright data scientists areself taught Years of Programming ML 4 5 years Might show increased experience The passing of time doesn t reflecthow much one has learned Pay USD 100 000 Very high pay can signal high skill High pay doesn t guarantee skill Regional bias also involved Spending USD 100 000 A company investing thousands in MLis investing in bright DS employees How much a company spends on ML doesn tdefine the skill of the employer In the end I decided to use pay as my delimiter. 1 The problemOk so we agreed on using the pay as the indicator. tg td border color 010307 border style solid border width 1px font family Source Code Pro monospace font size 14px overflow hidden padding 10px 5px word break normal. 1600 Very High 20 000 50 000 units These people can buy more McMeals than more than 90 of our base users. However these personal aspects don t define an outstanding Data Scientist. The next 3 most used languages are SQL R and Bash all very useful in the Data Science discipline. 3 The Expertise and Work EnvironmentHere is our chance to take a glimpse into the work environment and skills acquired. 1 The Personal ProfileWhere do they reside Some pointers we observe here The top countries do match the profile of the majority of masters grandmasters on Kaggle. Machine Learning Course Stanford https www. In the Very High Pay and Crazy High Pay groups more than 50 of the respondents are employed in companies that spend tens of thousands of dollars on their ML equipment and team. My personal opinion is that the 20s and 30s are hectic anyway and the golden ages are still after 40. Hence the majority of extremely well paid respondents choose to continue their superior studies to a Doctoral. Is GPU better Technically no either if you choose CPU GPU or TPU they all outperform in some areas and underperform in others. CriteriaUnfortunately there will need to be some bias involved. 5 The Machine Learning PreferencesIn this last chapter we ll find out what machine learning tools and resources these Data Science veterans use as well as what we need to focus on when we start our Machine Learning journey. a person in Ukraine with 90k a year may buy more valuables in their country than another person in Japan with 150k a year. Hence ML products Experiments or Automated ML aren t a popular choice between our top respondents. Introducing the subject Ahoy If you are like me you ve always been looking up to the top Data Scientists the cream of the community the very few that somehow through some magic only they know manage to understand teach and perform like none others. Libraries below 2. Looking at the ML expertise the donut is more evenly split between 1 and 10 years with less than 10 having 10 years of experience. Or are they The following graphs show some fascinating insights Firstly respondents around all groups agreed that their company is either using well established ML or they ve just started implementing ML into the business and these numbers are increasing as the years pass according to the general summary https www. 17 CSS STYLE Add unique ID There is no missing data for country Remove people with NA for yearly compensation This operation removes half of the data Remove Country Other Compute middle pay the middle of the interval Rename columns Add the price of a McDonalds Menu Remove countries where no McMeal price was found meaning Ghana Compute the McMeal units border size in pixel resolution number of pixels in x and y rgb or rgba array grayscale image if bar_is_too_short x 0 Columns Select data Rename Apply role coding Environment Social Media and First Steps Columns Exclude none others Data Data prep ML Products ML Experiments Auto ML Append category Create dataframes Change dataframes Results https www. It might be misunderstood there might be people that completed the salary in their base currency. org wiki Pareto_principle. png ax ax1 zoom 0. ConclusionI for one would have loved to see a survey like this when I started some 1 year and a half ago. Later age 45 50s are also visible. Now the only thing that remains is where do we draw the line in the McMeal units About 2 300 people have at least 10 000 Meals or more 10 000 threshold was chosen looking at Q3. There was a tweet from Grandmaster Bojan Tunguz that was sarcastically stating that all models besides Neural Nets are obsolete and you should focus only on these. Who are they Let s take it step by step As the percentage of the entire population of the survey is mostly formed by males the high end people we re studying match accordingly. For Tools Analysis the most popular are the Local Development Environments like Jupyter Notebooks or R Studio. The map is BLANK for the moment but it will start revealing itself once we begin discovering new Realms. Looking at age we can observe that the average age increases by category High Pay the average age is around 35 yo Very High Pay average age starts moving towards 40 yo and 45 yo these bars start to rise Crazy High Pay the 30s drop suddenly whereas the beginning of 40s stays the same. However most respondents say that they would like to gain knowledge of Google Cloud Products in the next 2 years. add_patch arrow Set columns Speciffic data Prep Sankey Data Get the graph data Colors Data to dict dict to sankey PLOT Cloud Big Data BI Tools Data Prep Plots Plot 1 Plot 2 Beautify Libraries PLOT The barplot Bubbles Beautify Images ML DL Plot Bar1 Bar2 Bar3 Beautify ML at Work School Columns Plot Pie 1 draw circle Pie 2 Settings Image Get Data Erase Other category Group by Code values Plots Plot 1 Plot 2 Plot 2 Beautify offset_png x 3. Kaggle and Colab however are popular options as well. And another area of the map has revealed itself the Work Habitat Closer look 3. com kaggle survey 2020 Libraries Set defaults of the notebook Color Palettes Data Import Cost of Living Data Data Plot ax. Looking at the coding expertise we see more than 50 of them having 10 years of coding experience. Instead of using pay we can look around the world at how many McMeals can one respondent buy with their salary in their own country. Basically they need to know everything. Some of the most crucial duties are Software Engineer more oriented towards data infrastructure exploration and creating ML models. There is a lack of frequent usage in Automated ML as well however there can be seen a general trend for Automated Model Selection for the next 2 years. https analyticsindiamag. The usual environments used are Jupyter Notebooks PyCharm Colab and Kaggle. input 2020 cost of living pirate_hat. Hence complicated methodologies aren t necessarily better. 2 The Solution Thanks to a good friend who gave me this idea we can all have a snack break now. This is also the oldest 13 years the most volatile and versatile library so the fact that it has the most popularity isn t a shock. Out of the deep learning frameworks Tensorflow is the most popular but PyTorch is starting to gain some visibility itself it is 1 year younger than Tensorflow so it s only natural that it is a little bit behind. Hence I had to define what is a successful data scientist. And finally our map is completely revealed Closer look 4. In the Kaggle Survey there is no feature or clue to identify which of the respondents are Masters Grandmasters neither the rank nor any performance within the Kaggle Community. add_artist ab Arrow Get mcmeal_units Plot Arrow Fries plt. are systematic issues so we ll have to go ahead and trust the Kagglers that they completed the pay question to the best of their abilities. On our way to finding the treasureAlright We established our feature normalized it excluded the regional bias and segmented our target respondents. However this feature has many issues on its own. As resources for getting the daily Data Science intake Youtube had the lead possibly from the multitude of videos on different abstract topics which are better understood from animated content rather than by only reading them. Takeaway Our top respondents use Youtube Personal Blogs and Twitter to keep informed on the latest Data Science gossips while having lots of trust in Coursera as a reliable source of learning. Building a Smarter and Faster Path to Greatness Functions below 1. 05 offset 0 border 1. that they have a Doctoral in a field supported by Data Science work. Glad that this survey also reflects that. com kaggle survey 2020 On average most respondents regardless of their pay are located in small companies in 20 of the cases and more than 50 of the cases in large ones 1000 employees. tg c3ow border color 010307 text align center vertical align top Accelerator Explanation GPU Graphics Processing Unit Designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images. But how This survey is an opportunity to take this curiosity very close and personal in the search for the treasure that might reveal us the steps to reach that greatness. However Crazy High Pay steals 15 percentage points from the Master category and adds to the Doctoral category. Hence the graph shows that the bigger the individual pay the more the company invests in ML in its business model. tg th border color 010307 border style solid border width 1px font family Source Code Pro monospace font size 14px font weight normal overflow hidden padding 10px 5px word break normal. ML Engineer most prominent duties are for building and exploring new ideas for ML models. The difference between High Pay and Crazy High Pay is in majority s choice to pursue their passion further to a Doctoral. Hence the industry s top data scientists use lots of Scikit learn Tensorflow Matplotlib and Seaborn. Hence we are noticing a top 20 of the top 20 of the top 20 situation meaning out of 9 893 total respondents 2 301 25 have more than 10 000 units out of the 2 301 respondents 705 20 have more than 20 000 units out of the 705 respondents 100 15 have more than 50 000 units What does this mean It doesn t matter to which category you look the distribution is always going to be skewed to the right. So what are the top Data Scientists using to move fast during competitions and achieve the best scores We know that they mostly use their personal laptop workstation but how do these look like The visualization below is representative of all 3 Pay Categories. 2 The EducationAs for education the 3 Pay Categories differentiate through High Pay and Very High Pay have very similar distributions. So ML Experiments not so popular at the moment. And this chapter shows precisely that. 50 of the respondents have or plan to complete a Masters s degree in the next 2 years. what do we choose We can t just take all people with a salary 80k this would be highly bias and inefficient 80k is lots of money in the UK but not that much in the US. Japan China Indonesia Russia Canada and the UK are the other 6 places where these highly skilled people reside. Hence the go to reliable sources for getting that Data Science information were Coursera Kaggle Learn Udemy Youtube and Blogs. As you may know indeed many Masters Grandmasters discuss on Twitter podcasts etc. What does this mean It means that exceptional people do have lots of coding experience but NOT ML necessarily and most of them are on Kaggle because they might have recently or in the last years found their passion in data. Takeaway We ve learned that our high end respondents are Python people usually coding on their personal gear. Let the hunt conclude in elegance Reliable Sources to Keep InformedThe learnings below are representative for all 3 levels of Pay Categories meaning that all behave in the same manner so the split wasn t shown For learning the most popular choice was Coursera as you may know Coursera has the most popular Machine Learning course https www. TPU Tensor Processing Unit AI accelerator developed by Google specifically for neural network machine learning. Mostly used in Deep Learning problems. When working on the personal computer the usage is usually oriented towards the classics Jupyter RStudio and PyCharm. com cost of living rankings_by_country.

As for the visualization libraries our top end respondents mainly prefer and use the originals Matplotlib Seaborn and Plotly with Ggplot for R. 700 Crazy High 50 000 units These people can buy more McMeals than more than 99 of our base users. They most often use GPUs but no worries No Accelerator whatsoever is a popular choice as well meaning skill only can bring you some pretty awesome results as well. Hence there is a clear direct correlation between high pay and age the older the wiser the wealthier. Hence I truly hope that this analysis will bring some light for anybody in any query they might have. Happy Data Sciencin 5. I will be analyzing these people from now on. Regarding ML Experiments there is even a more prominent lack of interest as None is the predominant answer followed from far by TensorBoard. Hence all our top respondents regardless of the Pay Category use and recommend the most Python followed by SQL R and Bash. How large are the company and the team The 2 plots match very well the overall distribution of the respondents you can see the overall summary here https www. It doesn t take into account the purchasing power e. The takeaway here is that no simple method tool or model is redundant not even for the great of the great. FancyArrowPatch 8 0 1 1 connectionstyle arc3 rad 0 kw plt. And the Education Mountains revealed themselves Closer look 3. Takeaway The high end respondents have mostly a high to very high education the majority have at least a Masters s complete. What Frameworks to have in your Pocket The below graphs and explanations are representative for all 3 Pay Categories For the overall Frameworks Scikit learn has the lead. Oh and look The first portion of the map is clear now Closer look 3. However because we re talking about high end Data Scientists who most certainly are involved in their projects finances this bias might be lower. The Code Waters is now visible Closer look 3. There are the occasional trolls who might give a lower or a much higher salary than they actually have. A McMeal may solve our regional bias problem. 4 The Coding PreferencesNow we know that more than half of our respondents have 10 years of coding experience. Nevertheless this column is expressed in dollars. However small or big I think that it s best to ask a professional a great veteran in the discipline a guru a Grandmaster what is the best way to learn that specific subject And if this notebook helped you just a bit getting closer to your answers or a mentor I can declare myself happy and fulfilled. Learn more about this comparison here. Hence the vast majority of our respondents use GPU acceleration however there are a few very experienced TPU users that rely mostly on TPU during their work competitions. for the love of God GPUs And with the internet full of healthy and diverse opinions it is easy to get lost and start not to trust the sources. So our top respondents analyze data mostly on Local Environments and deploy models either on GitHub or keep them on their local machine. How many McMeal menus can you buy 2. Hence the most popular choices were the simpler ones such as Regressions Tree Based Methods General Classification methods and Word Embeddings. This is a direct implication of the companies size there are many respondents in tiny companies hence smaller DS teams and vice versa. org learn machine learning Specs tools that helped visualisation creating the pirate map Z8 G4 Workstation 2 CPUs 96GB Memory NVIDIA Quadro RTX 8000 RAPIDS version 0. TPU users are 7 out of all respondents however half of them have been using TPUs more than 6 times and around a quarter of them more than 25 times. With no experience and no slight clue what data science is what programming language do I need to know how do you do machine learning what is a notebook how deep is deep learning and. Good luck and may we all succeed with grace. Regarding NLP our top respondents were Word Embeddings and Transformers. tg border collapse collapse border spacing 0. However I will also be segmenting them into three categories. com kaggle survey 2020. Machine Learning Miscellaneous ToolsFinally the visualization and discussion below are representative for all 3 Pay Categories as well For ML Products there is a general lack of interest for all the presented options as None was the most popular choice. jsp Pareto Principle https en. Blogs such as Towards Data Science Twitter and Publications were a popular choice as well. This is why segmentation is so important here. Secondly I could lower the regional bias significantly more of that in the next chapter. Role and Duties at WorkPointers here The most frequent jobs for the top respondents are Data Scientist ML Engineer or Software Engineer Analyst incorporates 3 jobs Data Analyst Business Analyst and Statistician. org learn machine learning from Stanford University with the top instructor being the King of ML Andrew Ng. Hence we ll start from now on to look at education expertise work ethic and knowledge rather than focusing on biological racial or other environmental aspects. However we mustn t lose sight of the emerging libraries that have the potential to overcome soon the giants such as PyTorch can you already tell I m a fan of PyTorch Machine Learning Deep Learning BasicsThe below graphs and explanations are representative for all 3 Pay Categories Awkwardly enough the most frequent choices for ML Methods were Regressions and Tree Based methods which are more straightforward approaches than Neural Nets.
