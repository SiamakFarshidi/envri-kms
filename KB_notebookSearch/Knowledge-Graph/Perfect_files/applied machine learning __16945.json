Clustering A clustering problem is where you want to discover the inherent groupings in the data such as grouping customers by purchasing behaviour. Market Segmentation of companies by location industry vertical. These regression estimates are used to explain the relationship between one dependent variable and one or more independent variables. Libraries and Data Model and Accuracy Gaussian NB BernoulliNB KNN KNN does not learn any model. The model fits a Gaussian density to each class assuming that all classes share the same covariance matrix. Bayesian approach is a general way of defining and estimating statistical models that can be applied to different models.

Create an instance of the Prophet class and then fit our dataframe to it. It extracts low dimensional set of features from a high dimensional data set with a motive to capture as much information as possible and to visualise high dimensional data it also reduces noise and finally makes other algorithms to work better because we are injecting fewer inputs. Unsupervised Machine Learning Unsupervised learning is the training of an algorithm using information that is neither classified nor labeled and allowing the algorithm to act on that information without guidance. Unsupervised Machine Learning 3. Along with simplicity Naive Bayes is known to outperform even highly sophisticated classification methods Example Emails are given and we have to find the spam emails from that. Time of predicting Linear Regression It is a basic and commonly used type of predictive analysis. Each instance in essence votes for their class and the class with the most votes is taken as the prediction Example Should the bank give a loan to an individual Would an individual default on his or her loan Is that person closer in characteristics to people who defaulted or did not default on their loans Libraries and Data As Classifier Model and Accuracy As Regression Library and Data Model and Accuracy Perceptron It is single layer neural network and used for classification Random Forest Random forest is collection of tress forest and it builds multiple decision trees and merges them together to get a more accurate and stable prediction.

Instead the focus is on performance which involves finding a balance between exploration of uncharted territory and exploitation of current knowledge Application of Supervised Machine Learning 1. Y a bX where Y Dependent Variable a intercept X Independent variable b Slope Example University GPA 0. Then specify the number of days to forecast using the periods parameter. Steps of Machine Learning4. Object recognition in computer vision 9. If we put the number back in the bowl it may be selected more than once. The choice of priors can have the regularizing effect. Library and Data Model and Accuracy LDA A classifier with a linear decision boundary generated by fitting class conditional densities to the data and using Bayes rule. Capable of handling large scale data. In prediction problems involving unstructured data images text etc. A spam filter looks at email messages for certain key words and puts them in a spam folder if they match. Evaluate Algorithms Machine Learning Machine Learning is the science of getting computers to learn and act like humans do and improve their learning over time in autonomous fashion by feeding them data and information in the form of observations and real world interactions. Call predict to make a prediction and store it in the forecast dataframe. Example To analyse data for frequent if then patterns and using the criteria support and confidence to identify the most important relationships. It is capable of learning order dependence LSTM can be used for machine translation speech recognition and more. Using these set of variables we generate a function that map inputs to desired outputs. There are many algorithm for getting machines to learn from using basic decision trees to clustering to layers of artificial neural networks depending on what task you re trying to accomplish and the type and amount of data that you have available. 4 Calculate the centroid or mean of all objects in each cluster. Library and Data Model and Forecast Arima Library and Data Model Prediction Evaluate Algorithms The evaluation of algorithm consist three following steps 1. The main idea behind unsupervised learning is to expose the machines to large volumes of varied data and allow it to learn and infer from the data. It is mainly used for sorting large amounts of data. Web System Configuration 5. Reinforcement Machine Learning Reinforcement Learning is a type of Machine Learning which allows machines to automatically determine the ideal behaviour within a specific context in order to maximize its performance. Libraries and data Model and Accuracy Confusion Matrix Report Gaussian Process Classifier Support Vector Machine Support Vector Machines are perhaps one of the most popular and talked about machine learning algorithms. Input and output data are labeled for classification to provide a learning basis for future data processing. What s neat here is that you can inspect the dataframe and see the predictions as well as the lower and upper boundaries of the uncertainty interval. Traffic Light Control 3. It can be used for both classification and regression problems. Pattern recognition Application of Unsupervised Machine Learning 1. Application of Reinforcement Machine Learning 1. 3 Assign objects to their closest cluster center according to the Euclidean distance function. Example When we have to bring out strong patterns in a data set or to make data easy to explore and visualize Apriori It is a categorisation algorithm attempts to operate on database records particularly transactional records or records including certain numbers of fields or items. com vanshjatana data visualization NLP https www. Evaluate Algorithm 5. Organizing computing clusters based on similar event patterns and processes. Quantitative structure 3. There are three types of machine learning 1. hough using the whole dataset is really useful for getting to the minima in a less noisy or less random manner but the problem arises when our datasets get really huge and for that SGD come in action Library and Data Model and Accuracy Lasso In statistics and machine learning lasso least absolute shrinkage and selection operator also Lasso or LASSO is a regression analysis method that performs both variable selection and regularization in order to enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the statistical model it produces. It is primarily a classier method that performs classification tasks by constructing hyperplanes in a multidimensional space that separates cases of different class labels. Prophet only takes data as a dataframe with a ds datestamp and y value we want to forecast column. Database marketing 4. It differs from standard supervised learning in that correct input output pairs need not be presented and sub optimal actions need not be explicitly corrected. Machine Learning and Types2. It is designed to be distributed and efficient with the following advantages 1. Support of parallel and GPU learning. Personalized Recommendations 6.

Deep Learning We can apply machine learning model by following six steps 1. It combines feature elimination from Lasso and feature coefficient reduction from the Ridge model to improve your model s predictions. It is similar to Support vector Regression but relatively very fast. We want to select a random sample of numbers from the bowl. The output can be calculated as the class with the highest frequency from the K most similar instances.

Create a dataframe with the dates for which we want a prediction to be made with make_future_dataframe. Association An association rule learning problem is where you want to discover rules that describe large portions of your data such as people that buy X also tend to buy Y. This algorithm consist of a target outcome variable or dependent variable which is to be predicted from a given set of predictors independent variables. Unsupervised learning problems can be further grouped into clustering and association problems. The idea of Logistic Regression is to find a relationship between features and probability of particular outcome. com vanshjatana text classification Table of Content1.
