Example Almost all classification algorithms. To calculate a measure of the error of our model we may classify all the observations having values 0. To train binary classifiers choose the appropriate metric for the task evaluate the classifiers using cross validation select the precision recall tradeoff that fits our needs and compare various models using ROC curves and ROC AUC scores. In particular if we have many more pictures of Alice than of Bob or Charlie we may want to give more weight to the classifier s score on pictures of Alice. This means that a dumb model that always predicts 0 1 would be right null_accuracy of the time. 5 represents a model as good as random. When we add more features the term in the denominator n k 1 decreases so the whole expression increases. png Recall Sensitivity It is the number of True Positives divided by the number of all relevant samples all samples that should have been identified as positive. Such a classification system that outputs multiple binary labels is called a multilabel classification system. On the other hand suppose we train a classifier to detect shoplifters on surveillance images it is probably fine if our classifier has only 30 precision as long as it has 99 recall sure the security guards will get a few false alerts but almost all shoplifters will get caught. let s suppose you decide to aim for 80 recall. The model may give satisfying results when evaluated using a metric say accuracy_score but may give poor results when evaluated against other metrics such as logarithmic_loss or any other such metric. Ideally if we have a perfect model all the events will have a probability score of 1 and all non events will have a score of 0. This is where we can use R Squared metric. To make predictions on the training set for now instead of calling the classifier s predict method you can just run this code Conclusion Comparison of Log loss with ROC F1 Case 1 Balanced Dataset S. 9 Predicted Model 1 0. Scikit Learn detects when we try to use a binary classification algorithm for a multi class classification task and it automatically runs OvA except for SVM classifiers for which it uses OvO. We can call predict_proba to get the list of probabilities that the classifier assigned to each instance for each class. Now we can make a prediction and notice that it outputs two labels There are many ways to evaluate a multilabel classifier and selecting the right metric really depends on the project. But it only takes into account the order of probabilities and hence it does not take into account the model s capability to predict higher probability for samples more likely to be positive Log Loss. jpg This Scikit learn https scikit learn. AUC is useful even when there is high class imbalance unlike classification accuracy Fraud case Null accuracy almost 99 AUC is useful hereGeneral AUC predictions. Let s raise the thresholdThis confirms that raising the threshold decreases recall. Now this value is as large as possible as Case 1 s and Case 3 s which indicates a good prediction. The RMSE is analogous to the standard deviation and is a measure of how large the residuals are spread out. Interpreting ROC Plot Interpreting the ROC plot is very different from a regular line plot. If one number is really small between precision and recall the F1 Score of raises a flag and is more closer to the smaller number than the bigger one giving the model an appropriate score rather than just an arithmetic mean. png attachment Screen 20Shot 202019 10 17 20at 2009. Because though there is an X and a Y axis we don t read it as for an X value of 0. Logarithmic Loss Log Loss Logistic Loss Cross Entropy Loss When working with Log Loss the classifier must assign probability to each class for all the samples. hat y_ ij outputs a probability 0 1 log x is nagative if 0 x 1. False Positive Rate corresponds to the proportion of negative data points that are mistakenly considered as positive with respect to all negative data points. Inferences drawn from the above example balanced dataset If we care for absolute probabilistic difference go with log loss. Before applying MSE we must eliminate all nulls infinites from the input. True Positive Rate corresponds to the proportion of positive data points that are correctly considered as positive with respect to all positive data points. Why should we choose Adjusted R\u00b2 over R\u00b2 Adjusted R\u00b2 will consider the marginal improvement added by an additional term in our model. One vs One OvO Strategy Train a binary classifier for every pair of digits one to distinguish 0s and 1s another to distinguish 0s and 2s another for 1s and 2s and so on. com Why is logistic regression considered a linear model answer Sebastian Raschka 1 EndIf you reached this far please comment and upvote this kernel feel free to make improvements on the kernel and please share if you found anything useful Train multiple models with various hyperparameters using the training set select the model and hyperparameters that perform best on the validation set. predicted probabilities for class 1 probabilities of positive class SGD Classifier fit model make class predictions for the validation set predicted probabilities for class 1 Random Forest Classifier fit model make class predictions for the validation set predicted probabilities for class 1 Method 2 calculate null accuracy for binary multi class classification problems null_accuracy y_train. ROC AUC score is independent of the threshold set for classification because it only considers the rank of each prediction and not its absolute value. Confusion Matrix A confusion matrix is an N X N matrix where N is the number of classes being predicted. Example Consider a face recognition classifier it s task is to recognizes several people on the same picture. RMSE Because the MSE is squared its units do not match that of the original output. Example Reference The cat is sitting on the matMachine Translation 1 On the mat is a catMachine Translation 2 There is cat sitting catMachine Translation 3 The cat is sitting on the tam Bonus Multi Class Classification MultiClass Classifiers can distinguish between more than two classes. png F1 Score F1 Score is the Harmonic Mean between precision and recall. Mean Absolute Error Average of the difference between the Original Values and the Predicted Values. Precision It is the number of True Positive divided by the number of positive results predicted by the classifier. But doing so we are at a high risk of increasing the misclassification. 24 The only difference in model1 and model2 is their prediction for observation 13 14. Comparison of Adjusted R\u00b2 over RMSEAbsolute value of RMSE does not actually tell how good bad a model is. Loss_ mse 1 Loss_ logloss infty. Scikit Learn did not have to run OvA or OvO on Random Forest because Random Forest classifiers can directly classify instances into multiple classes. MSE Being more complex and biased towards higher deviation RMSE is still the default metric of many models because loss function defined in terms of RMSE is smoothly differentiable whereas Mean Absolute Error requires complicated linear programming to compute the gradient. In other words sensitivity and specificity. Instead of calling the classifier s predict method we can call its decision_function method which returns a score for each instance and then make predictions based on those scores using any threshold we want Classifier uses a threshold equal to 0 so the previous code returns the same result as the predict method i. The metric explains the performance of a model. This is a way of analyzing how the sensitivity and specificity perform for the full range of probability cutoffs that is from 0 to 1. png To minimising False Negatives we would want our Recall to be as close to 100 To minimising False Positives we would want our Precision to be as close to 100 Specificity TNR True Negative Rate Proportion of actual negative cases which are correctly identified. With that threshold the precision is 80 4 out of 5. B Imbalanced Few Negatives S. smaller the UNCERTAINTY better is the model. MSE doesn t strongly penalize misclassifications even for the perfect mismatch. Random Forest Classifiers or Naive Bayes Classifiers are capable of handling multiple classes directly. Others Support Vector Machine classifiers or Linear classifiers are strictly binary classifiers. Figure below shows a few digits positioned from the lowest score on the left to the highest score on the right the task is to predict number 5 from the images. Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error. give probability outputs. Example Let the training labels are 0 and 1 but our training predictions are 0. Classification Accuracy may give us the false sense of achieving high accuracy. smaller the logloss better is the model i. The correct predictions falls on the diagonal line of the matrix. When not to use accuracy metric When only one class holds majority of samples. Screen 20Shot 202019 11 08 20at 2017. Case 2 Imbalanced Dataset A Imbalanced Few Positives S. Both F1 score and ROC AUC score is doing better in preferring model 2 over model 1. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 Actual Balanced 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Predicted Model 1 0. If we want to force ScikitLearn to use OvO or OvA we can use the OneVsOneClassifier or OneVsRestClassifier classes. Inferences drawn from the above example imbalanced dataset If we care for a class which is smaller in number independent of the fact whether it is positive or negative go for ROC AUC score. Evaluation Algorithm Logistic Regression. When will we prefer F1 over ROC AUC Prefer PR curve whenever the positive class is rare or when we care more about the false positives than the false negatives. Once model type and hyperparameters have been selected train final model using these hyperparameters on the full training set the generalized error is finally measured on the test set. Hence if the loss function is not convex it is not guaranteed that we will always reach the global minima rather we might get stuck at local minima. 8 we could gauge how good our model is against a random model which has an accuracy of 0. For a perfect match between predicted values and actual labels both the loss values would be 0. There can be 4 major cases for the values of y_ ij and p_ ij Case 1 y_ ij 1 p_ ij High Case 2 y_ ij 1 p_ ij Low Case 3 y_ ij 0 p_ ij Low Case 4 y_ ij 0 p_ ij HighHow does LogLoss measures uncertainity If we have more of Case 1 s and Case 3 s then the sum and mean inside the logloss formula would be greater and will be substantially larger in comparison to what it would have been if Case 2 s and Case 4 s got added. The goal is to see which model actually captures the difference in classifying the imbalanced class better class with few observations here it is label 1. It is clear that the above result comes from a dumb classifier which just ignores the input and just predicts one of the classes as output. R Squared does not penalize for adding features that add no value to the model. True Positive Rate Sensitivity Recall True Positive Rate is defined as TP FN TP. TPR and FPR both are computed at threshold values such as 0. Since the MSE and RMSE both square the residual they are similarly affected by outliers. Then our model can easily get 98 training accuracy by simply predicting every training sample belonging to class A. 8 Consider Case 1 Balanced Data it looks like model 1 is doing a better job in predicting the absolute probabilities whereas model 2 is working best in ranking observations according to their true labels. The greater the F1 Score the better is the performance of our model. For instance in a binary classification problem the outputs will be either 0 or 1. Smaller the MAE better is the model. Suppose the decision threshold is positioned at the central arrow we will find 4 true positives actual 5s on the right of that threshold and one false positive 6. Multilabel ClassificationClassifier outputs multiple classes for each instance. If either predicted or the actual value is big RMSE RMSLE If both predicted and actual values are big RMSE RMSLE RMSLE becomes almost negligible Root Mean Squared Log Error sqrt frac 1 N sum_ i 1 N log y_ i 1 log hat y_ i 1 2 R_squared In the case of a classification problem if the model has an accuracy of 0. RMSE is the square root of MSE. Precision Recall TradeoffIn some contexts we mostly care about precision and in other contexts we care about recall. 1 and predicted value ex. False Positive Rate Specificity False Positive Rate is defined as FP FP TN. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 Actual Balanced 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Predicted Model 1 0. This is where logLoss comes into picture. Regression Metrices Dataset Boston House Price dataset. In regression problems the output is always continuous in nature and requires no further treatment. True Negatives The cases in which we predicted NO and the actual output was NO. This is because it may so happen that many values having probabilities 0. html page provides the excellent reference. Specificity frac True Negatives True Negatives False Positives Screen 20Shot 202019 10 17 20at 2009. Let s verify with the actual score F1 threshold 0. So the random model can be treated as a benchmark. Log Loss exists in the range 0. What changes are the variance that we are measuring. Now let us closely follow the formula of LogLoss. AUC The probabilistic interpretation of ROC AUC score is that if we randomly choose a positive case and a negative case the probability that the positive case outranks the negative case according to the classifier is given by the AUC. However R\u00b2 increases with increasing terms even though the model is not actually improving. To do this simply set average weighted in the preceding code. Regression Metrics Mean Absolute Error. Specificity is the exact opposite of Recall. roc_auc_score y_test y_pred_prob fit model make class predictions for the testing set calculate Mean Absolute Error calculate Mean Squared Error calculate Root Mean Squared Error calculate Mean Squared Log Error calculate R2 score from sklearn. For example if a model has adjusted R\u00b2 equal to 0. Here rank is determined according to order by predicted values. If the classifier has been trained to recognize three faces Alice Bob and Charlie when it is shown a picture of Alice and Charlie it should output 1 0 1. True Positive Rate and False Positive Rate both have values in the range 0 1. KNeighborsClassifier supports multilabel classification. To understand this tradeoff let s look at how the SGDClassifier LogisticRegression RandomForestClassifier makes their classification decisions. It tells how precise the classifier is how many instances it classifies correctly as well as how robust it is it does not miss a significant number of instances. False Positives The cases in which we predicted YES and the actual output was NO. Recall frac True Positives True Positives False Negatives Screen 20Shot 202019 10 17 20at 2009. Classification Metrices Dataset Pima Indians onset of diabetes dataset. Conversely lowering the threshold increases recall and reduces precision. Root Mean Squared Error. 00 and a graph is drawn. Task 0 9 digits classification One vs All OvA Classification Strategy Train 10 binary classifiers one for each digit a 0 detector a 1 detector a 2 detector and so on. It should attach one label per person it recognizes. F1 score is sensitive to threshold and we would want to tune it first before comparing the models. Log loss is only defined for two or more labels. But when x and y are different then it s closer to the smaller number as compared to the larger number. It uses a modified form of precision metric. the number of instances with that target label. 5 ROC AUC LogLoss Model 1 0. To decide which threshold to use we first need to get the scores of all instances in the training set using the cross_val_predict function again but this time specifying that you want it to return decision scores probability instead of class Now we can simply select the threshold value that gives us the best precision recall tradeoff for our task. Probability outputs can be converted to class output by creating a threshold probability. Suppose there are N samples belonging to M classes then the Log Loss is calculated as below Log Loss frac 1 N sum_ i 1 N sum_ i 1 M y_ ij log hat y_ ij where y_ ij indicates whether sample i belongs to class j or not p_ ij indicates the probability of sample i belonging to class jThe negative sign negates log hat y_ ij output which is always negative. The Confusion matrix in itself is not a performance measure as such but almost all of the performance metrics are based on Confusion Matrix and the numbers inside it. The AUC represents a model s ability to discriminate between positive and negative classes. Classification Metrics Accuracy. 6If we consider log loss Model 2 is worst giving a high value of log loss because the absolute probabilities have big difference from actual labels. As we take square of the error the effect of larger errors sometimes outliers become more pronounced then smaller error. 9 F1 threshold 0. For MNIST problem Under the hood Scikit Learn trained 10 binary classifiers get their decision scores for the image and selected the class with the highest score. IMPORTANT first argument is true values second argument is predicted probabilities we pass y_test and y_pred_prob we do not use y_pred_class because it will give incorrect results without generating an error roc_curve returns 3 objects false positive rate fpr true positive rate tpr thresholds define a function that accepts a threshold and prints sensitivity and specificity Logistic Regression Random Forest Classifier SGD IMPORTANT first argument is true values second argument is predicted probabilities print metrics. 5 F1 threshold which maximize score ROC AUC LogLoss Model 1 0. multiclass import OneVsOneClassifier ovo_clf OneVsOneClassifier SGDClassifier random_state 42 ovo_clf. They influence how we weight the importance of different characteristics in the results. In that case the curve will rise steeply covering a large area before reaching the top right. c_ y_train_large y_train_odd knn_clf KNeighborsClassifier knn_clf. We can set SGDClassifier as the base estimator in Scikit learn s CalibratedClassifierCV which will generate probability estimates. But when we talk about the RMSE metrics we do not have a benchmark to compare. Minimizing the squared error \ud835\udc3f2 over a set of numbers results in finding its mean and minimizing the absolute error \ud835\udc3f1 results in finding its median. The formula for R Squared is as follows R 2 1 frac MSE model MSE baseline 1 frac sum_ i 1 N y_1 hat y_1 2 sum_ i 1 N bar y_1 hat y_1 2 MSE model Mean Squared Error of the predictions against the actual valuesMSE baseline Mean Squared Error of mean prediction against the actual valuesIn other words how good our regression model as compared to a very simple model that just predicts the mean value of target from the train set as predictions. This is because log loss function is symmetric and does not differentiate between classes. So an improved version over the R Squared is the adjusted R Squared. However if we care only about prediction accuracy then RMSE is best. neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier y_train_large y_train 7 y_train_odd y_train 2 1 y_multilabel np. 24 ROC AUC score handled the case of few negative labels in the same way as it handled the case of few positive labels. If both predicted and actual values are small RMSE and RMSLE are same. When the same model is tested on a test set with 60 samples of class A and 40 samples of class B then the test accuracy would drop down to 60. When we want to classify an image we get the decision score from each classifier for that image and we select the class whose classifier outputs the highest score. Instead what we have here is a line that traces the probability cutoff from 1 at the bottom left to 0 in the top right. whether we are under predicting the data or over predicting the data. Precision frac True Positives True Positives False Positives Screen 20Shot 202019 10 17 20at 2009. This code computes the average F1 score across all labels This assumes that all labels are equally important which may not be the case. For each instance they computes a score based on a decision function predict_proba and if that score is greater than a threshold they assigns the instance to the positive class or else it assigns it to the negative class. This is called the Precision Recall Tradeoff. A model performing equal to baseline would give R Squared as 0. NLP Metric BLEU Bilingual Evaluation Understudy It is mostly used to measure the quality of machine translation with respect to the human translation. Harmonic mean is an average when x and y are equal. head 1 len y_train calculate accuracy calculate logloss SGDClassifier s hinge loss doesn t support probability estimates. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 Actual Balanced 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 Predicted Model 1 0. Main advantage of OvO is that each classifier only needs to be trained on the part of the training set for the two classes that it must distinguish. fit X_train y_multilabel knn_clf. It can only be used to compare across two models whereas Adjusted R\u00b2 easily does that. Clearly log loss is failing in this case because according to log loss both the models are performing equally. fit X_train y_train Dataset MNIST from sklearn. The next lines create a KNeighborsClassifier instance which supports multilabel classification but not all classifiers do and we train it using the multiple targets array. Choosing the best model is sort of a balance between predicting 1 s accurately or 0 s accurately. Root Mean Squared Error sqrt frac 1 N sum_ i 1 N y_ i hat y_ i 2 Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error We take the log of the predictions and actual values. Model 1 is doing a better job in classifying observation 13 label 0 whereas Model 2 is doing better in classifying observation 14 label 1. StratifiedKFold class performs stratified sampling to produce folds that contain a representative ratio of each class. Do not gives any idea of the direction of the error i. Now if we raise the threshold move it to the arrow on the right the false positive 6 becomes a true negative thereby increasing precision up to 100 in this case but one true positive becomes a false negative decreasing recall down to 50. Logistic Regression fit model Make class predictions for the validation set. RMSLE is usually used when we don t want to penalize huge differences in the predicted and the actual values when both predicted and actual values are huge numbers. Classification Accuracy Classification Accuracy or Accuracy is the ratio of number of correct predictions to the total number of input samples. Probability output Algorithms like Logistic Regression Random Forest Gradient Boosting Adaboost etc. Generally RMSE will be higher than or equal to MAE. Better the model higher the r2 value. Why is logistic regression considered a linear model A https www. You look up the first plot zooming in a bit and find that you need to use a threshold of about 0. When we want to classify an image we have to run the image through all 45 classifiers and see which class wins the most duels. The ROC curve is the only metric that measures how well the model does for different values of prediction probability cutoffs. Units of both RMSE MAE are same as y values which is not true for R Square. Classification Report. 4 important terms in Confusion Matrix True Positives The cases in which we predicted YES and the actual output was also YES. Not robust to outliers Range 0 infinity Mean Squared Error frac 1 N sum_ i 1 N y_ i hat y_ i 2 MAE vs. Multioutput Classification Multioutput Multiclass classification or simply multioutput classification is simply a generalization of multilabel classification where each label can be multiclass i. The same is not true for F1 score which needs a threshold value in case of probabilities output AUC is the percentage of the ROC plot that is underneath the curve. False Negatives The cases in which we predicted NO and the actual output was YES. In problems like fraud detection spam mail detection where positive labels are few we would like our model to predict positive classes correctly and hence we will sometime prefer those model who are able to classify these positive labels. If we multiply it by 1 we would make the value as small as possible. Range infinity 1 Adjusted R Squared On adding new features to the model the R Squared value either increases or remains the same. Answer 2 In classification scenarios we often use gradient based techniques Newton Raphson gradient descent etc. Accuracy frac Number of correct predictions Total number of predictions made frac TP TN TP TN FP FN Screen 20Shot 202019 10 17 20at 2009. In classification problems we use two types of algorithms dependent on the kind of output it creates Class output Algorithms like SVM and KNN create a class output. to find the optimal values for coefficients by minimizing the loss function. Why not Mean Squared Error as a loss function for Logistic Regression Equation for both the loss functions are as follows text log loss sum_ i 1 n y_i log hat y_i 1 y_i log 1 hat y_i text MSE sum_ i 1 n y_i hat y_i 2 Answer 1 Let us compute the loss value when there is a complete mismatch between actual value ex. org stable modules model_evaluation. It is computationally simple easily differentiable and present as default metric for most of the models. If we want a metric just to compare between two models from interpretation point of view then MAE may be a better choice. Model will be penalized more for making predictions that differ greatly from the corresponding actual value. One simple option is to give each label a weight equal to its support i. Log Loss gradually declines as the predicted probability improves thus Log Loss nearer to 0 indicates higher accuracy Log Loss away from 0 indicates lower accuracy. One approach is to measure the F1 score for each individual label or any other binary classifier metric discussed earlier then simply compute the average score. Hence it is very much important to choose the right metric to evaluate the Machine Learning model. For example if we trained a classifier to detect videos that are safe for kids ew would probably prefer a classifier that rejects many good videos low recall but keeps only safe ones high precision. Whereas the AUC is computed with regards to binary classification with a varying decision threshold log loss actually takes certainty of classification into account. Therefore the larger the area under the ROC curve the better is the model. predict 5 output array False True dtype bool y_train_knn_pred cross_val_predict knn_clf X_train y_train cv 10 f1_score y_train y_train_knn_pred average macro. 49 can have a true value of 1. But this is in complete disagreement with F1 AUC score according to which Model 2 has 100 accuracy. Null accuracy Accuracy that could be achieved by always predicting the most frequent class. The instance actually represents a 1 True and the classifier detects it when the threshold is 0 but it misses it when the threshold is increased to 2. It will increase if we add the useful terms and it will decrease if we add less useful predictors. Choice of metrics influences how the performance of machine learning algorithms is measured and compared. png attachment Screen 20Shot 202019 11 08 20at 2017. png When to use accuracy metric When there are roughly equal number of samples belonging to each class. Robust to outliers Range 0 infinity Mean Absolute Error frac 1 N sum_ i 1 N y_ i hat y_ i Mean Squared Error Takes the average of the square of the difference between the original values and the predicted values. This code creates a y_multilabel array containing two target labels for each digit image the first indicates whether or not the digit is large 7 8 or 9 and the second indicates whether or not it is odd. ROC Curve ROC can be broken down into sensitivity and specificity. Confusion Matrix gives us a matrix as output and describes the complete performance of the model. For such a model the area under the ROC will be a perfect 1. png Scikit Learn does not let us set the threshold directly but it does give us access to the decision scores that it uses to make predictions. If we care only for the final class prediction and we don t want to tune threshold go with AUC score. Evaluation Algorithm Logistic Regression SGDClassifier RandomForestClassifier. Quick Note SkLearn s predict_log_proba gives the logarithm of the probabilities this is often handier as probabilities can become very very small. Example Consider that there are 98 samples of class A and 2 samples of class B in our training set. Classification Report The classification_report function displays the precision recall f1 score and support for each class. For the MNIST problem this means training 45 binary classifiers. Example Support Vector Machines scale poorly with the size of the training set it is faster to train many classifiers on small training sets than training few classifiers on large training sets. it can have more than two possible values. MSE loss function for logistic regression is non convex and not recommended. This would now intuitively mean Smaller the value better is the model i. After doing the usual feature engineering selection implementing a model and getting some output in the form of a probability or a class the next step is to find out how effective is the model based on some metric using test datasets. So if we trace the curve from bottom left the value of probability cutoff decreases from 1 towards 0. 0 represents a model that made all predictions perfectly. F1 2 frac 1 frac 1 precision frac 1 recall Why Harmonic Mean Ex We have a binary classification model with the following results Precision 0 Recall 1If we take the arithmetic mean we get 0. Now if we were to take HM we will get 0 which is accurate as this model is useless for all purposes. Increasing Precision reduces Recall and vice versa. Log loss measures the UNCERTAINTY of the probabilities of the model by comparing them to the true labels and penalising the false classifications. Also we would like to note that with different thresholds F1 score is changing and preferring model 1 over model 2 for default threshold of 0. If there are N classes we need to train N N 1 2 classifiers. jpg attachment 570735. F1 score is very much same for both Model 1 Model 2 because positive labels are large in number and it cares only for the misclassification of positive labels. KNeighborsClassifier supports multioutput classification. 05 then it is definitely bad. If we have a good model more of the real events should be predicted as events resulting in high sensitivity and low FPR. The formula for adjusted R Squared is given by bar R 2 1 1 R 2 frac n 1 n k 1 k number of featuresn number of samplesThis metric takes the number of features into account. So we can use both these methods for class imbalance. SKLearn s Other algorithms can convert these class outputs to probability. 60 FailAUC ROC considers the predicted probabilities for determining the model s performance.
