Get the raw bounding box Ref https www. csv file Since there are over 2000 rows without bounding box coordinates. In this kernel we will try to understand the relationship better. gif Work In ProgressUpcoming Visualize the entire training dataset using W B Tables. Imports and Setups Hyperparams Load DatasetThis competition is unique because of how the data is presented and thus the problem statement. Get insight from the tables. com yujiariyasu plot 3positive classes Scale the bounding boxes. In this competition the task is to provide image level predictions none vs opacity as well as study level predictions negative typical atypical indeterminate. com xhlulu siim covid19 resized to 256px jpg. com xhlulu resized dataset. Click on the run page https wandb. Every image with bounding box coordinates belong to opacity label. e image level label we need to train an object detector for localization. Check out his amazing kernel https www. What s study and image There are 6334 unique chest scans or images while 6054 unique study directories. Click on the icon to interact with the UI. Better Data Understanding using W B Tables Check out the Table rightarrow https wandb. json img https i. ai ayush thakur kaggle covid artifacts basic eda eda c17893f765f142a4acbf files Radiogram 20EDA. The DICOM formatted radiograms of chest scans are available in this directory structure study series images. Visualize Metadata. log radiogram_eda table. The steps below can be used as it is with a training pipeline with littleeee modification. This kernel can be used to visualize the bounding boxes interactively using W B and will walk you through the process of logging bounding boxes. Visualize Bounding BoxesThis section will walk you through the steps required to use W B to log bounding boxes. csv Study level labels. This means that in some study directory there are more than one images. Load image Get bboxes Scale bounding boxes Get ground truth label W B image create an artifact for all the raw data Load image Get bboxes Scale bounding boxes Get ground truth label Get image with bounding boxes Add info in the table as new row wandb. Then when bounding boxes or localization For images with opacity label i. gif Credits I am using xhlulu s https www. com xhlulu siim covid 19 convert to jpg 256px that can be used to generate resized images with different resolution. Note Even though the true_label is opacity or none but I have logged the study level labels for more insight. Get scaling factor xmin ymin xmax ymax To log a bounding box you ll need to provide a dictionary with the following keys and values to the boxes keyword argument of wandb. This kernel can be considered a simple EDA kernel with the focus on deriving insights by interactively playing with the bounding boxes for each images. train_study_level. csv Image level labels. Notes Since some of the images don t have bounding box coordinates we will drop those rows. ai ayush thakur kaggle covid runs 3vxougc9 workspace user ayush thakur to interactively play with the bounding box coordinates.
