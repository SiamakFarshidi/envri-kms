Here I m going to use five features that were inspired by this script https www. I purposely avoid jumping into complicated models or joining together lots of data in order to show the basics of how to get started in machine learning Any comments or suggestions are much appreciated. We will do a lot of feature engineering when we start using the other data sources but in this notebook we will try only two simple feature construction methods Polynomial features Domain knowledge features Polynomial FeaturesOne simple feature construction method is called polynomial features http scikit learn. We first made sure to understand the data our task and the metric by which our submissions will be judged. com questions 266387 can auc roc be between 0 0 5. I m not sure what this exactly means but it may be a cumulative sort of credit rating made using numerous sources of data. Let s start looking at this variable. fit and then we make predictions on the testing data using. Now that the model has been trained we can use it to make predictions. We may use these feature importances as a method of dimensionality reduction in future work. This will get us slightly better results than the default LogisticRegression but it still will set a low bar for any future models. The following code performs both of these preprocessing steps. According to the documentation these features represent a normalized score from external data source. Now we can see whether any of these new features are correlated with the target. A model with a high ROC AUC will also have a high accuracy but the ROC AUC is a better representation of model performance. The submission has now been saved to the virtual environment in which our notebook is running. Pairs PlotAs a final exploratory plot we can make a pairs plot of the EXT_SOURCE variables and the DAYS_BIRTH variable. com koehrsen_willWill Just for Fun Light Gradient Boosting MachineNow if you want this part is entirely optional we can step off the deep end and use a real machine learning model the gradient boosting machine https machinelearningmastery. Feature importances are not the most sophisticated method to interpret a model or perform dimensionality reduction but they let us start to understand what factors our model takes into account when it makes predictions. We can clearly see that this feature has some relationship to the likelihood of an applicant to repay a loan. The Reciever Operating Characteristic ROC curve https en. io en latest Quick Start. com wp content uploads 2016 08 ROC curve. There is a clear trend younger applicants are more likely to not repay the loan The rate of failure to repay is above 10 for the youngest three age groups and beolow 5 for the oldest age group. com blog secret to data science success. Examine Missing ValuesNext we can look at the number and percentage of missing values in each column. The target 1 curve skews towards the younger end of the range. Exterior SourcesThe 3 variables with the strongest negative correlations with the target are EXT_SOURCE_1 EXT_SOURCE_2 and EXT_SOURCE_3. ConclusionsIn this notebook we saw how to get started with a Kaggle machine learning competition. Each previous credit has its own row in bureau but one loan in the application data can have multiple previous credits. The Pairs Plot https towardsdatascience. In future notebooks we will see how to work with more advanced models which mostly means adapting existing code to make it work better feature engineering and feature selection. This returns an m x 2 array where m is the number of observations. png The problem with label encoding is that it gives the categories an arbitrary ordering. html that creates the polynomials and the interaction terms up to a specified degree. org stable auto_examples model_selection plot_underfitting_overfitting. This creates a considerable number of new features. pdf or other dimensionality reduction methods https www. As an extremely important note anything we do to the training data we also have to do to the testing data. As Andrew Ng is fond of saying applied machine learning is basically feature engineering. There are many techniques we can use to both create features and select features. First we can show the correlations of the EXT_SOURCE features with the target and with each other. Along the way we performed necessary preprocessing steps such as encoding categorical variables imputing missing values and scaling features to a range. This may be confusing because we usually like to think in terms of accuracy but when we get into problems with inbalanced classes we will see this is the case accuracy is not the best metric. org wiki

Given these results it does not appear that our feature construction helped in this case. For all of these we will make the same KDE plot colored by the value of the TARGET. In this method we make features that are powers of existing features as well as interaction terms between existing features. org wiki Interaction_ statistics because they capture the interactions between variables. This is information that could be directly used by the bank because younger clients are less likely to repay the loan maybe they should be provided with more guidance or financial planning tips. Once the data exploration data preparation and feature engineering was complete we implemented a baseline model upon which we hope to improve. html to help us out. installments_payment payment history for previous loans at Home Credit. __ Improved Model Random ForestTo try and beat the poor performance of our baseline we can update the algorithm. One way to support anomalies quantitatively is by looking at the statistics of a column using the describe method. One way to try and understand the data is by looking for correlations between the features and the target. By itself the distribution of age does not tell us much other than that there are no outliers as all the ages are reasonable. This represents one of the patterns in machine learning feature engineering has a greater return on investment than model building and hyperparameter tuning. pdf but these variables will still be useful for a machine learning model to predict whether or not an applicant will repay a loan on time. The Random Forest is a much more powerful model especially when we use hundreds of trees. Although if we want to have any hope of seriously competing we need to use all the data for now we will stick to one file which should be more manageable. aspx a service dedicated to provided lines of credit loans to the unbanked population. For example the blue model is better than the red model which is better than the black diagonal line which indicates a naive random guessing model. com WillKoehrsen Machine Learning Projects master one_hot_encoding. From experience this will definitely help our model Model Interpretation Feature ImportancesAs a simple method to see which variables are the most relevant we can look at the feature importances of the random forest. The first column is the probability of the target being 0 and the second column is the probability of the target being 1 so for a single row the two columns must sum to 1. int64 and float64 are numeric variables which can be either discrete or continuous https stats. The correlation coefficient is not the greatest method to represent relevance of a feature but it does give us an idea of possible relationships within the data. At some point we probably will want to try dimensionality reduction removing features that are not relevant https en. This allows the entire world to see your work Follow up NotebooksFor those looking to keep working on this problem I have a series of follow up notebooks Manual Feature Engineering Part One https www. com 2017 01 23 a kaggle master explains gradient boosting. org wiki Dimensionality_reduction to reduce the size of the datasets. except for TARGET because the correlation of a variable with itself is always 1 Looking at the documentation DAYS_BIRTH is the age in days of the client at the time of the loan in negative days for whatever reason. In later work we will use models such as XGBoost that can handle missing values with no need for imputation https stats. Although this is not a significant correlation 0. com willkoehrsen intro to model tuning grid and random search As always I welcome feedback and constructive criticism. In this notebook we will take an initial look at the Home Credit default risk machine learning competition currently hosted on Kaggle. com willkoehrsen introduction to manual feature engineering p2 Introduction to Automated Feature Engineering https www. We see that there are only a handful of features with a significant importance to the model which suggests we may be able to drop many of the features without a decrease in performance and we may even see an increase in performance. We will put the x axis in years to make the plot a little more understandable. 0 very strong Let s take a look at some of more significant correlations the DAYS_BIRTH is the most positive correlation. html sphx glr auto examples model selection plot underfitting overfitting py. Data cleaning and formatting this was mostly done for us 3. To get the names we have to use the polynomial features get_feature_names method. Then we built a second slightly more complicated model to beat our first score. As a solution we will fill in the anomalous values with not a number np. The following code makes the predictions and selects the correct column. The final part is to share the share the notebook go to the settings tab and change the visibility to Public. The number of features has grown significantly due to one hot encoding. While choosing the right model and optimal settings are important the model can only learn from the data it is given. Aligning Training and Testing DataThere need to be the same features columns in both the training and testing data. Next we can look at the distribution of each of these features colored by the value of the target. __This model should score around 0. CorrelationsNow that we have dealt with the categorical variables and the outliers let s continue with the EDA. predict_proba remember that we want probabilities and not a 0 or 1. Feature engineering refers to a geneal process and can involve both feature construction adding new features from the existing data and feature selection choosing only the most important features or other methods of dimensionality reduction. org stable modules linear_model. Interaction terms are commonly used in statistical models https www. com gentle introduction gradient boosting algorithm machine learning using the LightGBM library http lightgbm. One of the safest approaches is just to set the anomalies to a missing value and then have them filled in using Imputation before machine learning. This diagram shows how all of the data is related image https storage. 678 when submitted to the competition exactly the same as that without the engineered features. Each row is one month of a credit card balance and a single credit card can have many rows. Jake VanderPlas writes about polynomial features in his excellent book Python for Data Science https jakevdp. object columns contain strings and are categorical features. Feature EngineeringKaggle competitions are won by feature engineering those win are those who can create the most useful features out of the data. com product 0636920052289. A model that simply guesses at random will have an ROC AUC of 0. Every loan has its own row and is identified by the feature SK_ID_CURR. The distribution looks to be much more in line with what we would expect and we also have created a new column to tell the model that these values were originally anomalous becuase we will have to fill in the nans with some value probably the median of the column. Let s make sure to create the new column and fill in the existing column with np. in class imbalance problem. org wiki Receiver_operating_characteristic graphs the true positive rate versus the false positive rate image http www. Column TypesLet s look at the number of columns of each data type.

To visualize the effect of the age on the target we will next make a kernel density estimation plot https en. We want to predict the probabilities of not paying a loan so we use the model predict. The numbers in the DAYS_BIRTH column are negative because they are recorded relative to the current loan application. From here the submission files can be submitted to the competition or downloaded. Many times in machine learning the only way to know if an approach will work is to try it out Domain Knowledge FeaturesMaybe it s not entirely correct to call this domain knowledge because I m not a credit expert but perhaps we could call this attempts at applying limited financial knowledge. To remove the columns in the training data that are not in the testing data we need to align the dataframes. How about the days of employment That doesn t look right The maximum value besides being positive is about 1000 years Just out of curiousity let s subset the anomalous clients and see if they tend to have higher or low rates of default than the rest of the clients. html The Gradient Boosting Machine is currently the leading model for learning on structured datasets especially on Kaggle and we will probably need some form of this model to do well in the competition. Examine the Distribution of the Target ColumnThe target is what we are asked to predict either a 0 for the loan was repaid on time or a 1 indicating the client had payment difficulties. There does appear to be a moderate positive linear relationship between the EXT_SOURCE_1 and the DAYS_BIRTH or equivalently YEARS_BIRTH indicating that this feature may take into account the age of the client. We will add these features to a copy of the training and testing data and then evaluate models with and without the features. Here we use the familiar Scikit Learn modeling syntax we first create the model then we train the model using. This is the integral of the curve. html logistic regression C which controls the amount of overfitting a lower value should decrease overfitting. Let s try using a Random Forest on the same training data to see how that affects performance. The findings may be interesting in their own right or they can be used to inform our modeling choices such as by helping us decide which features to use. The goal of EDA is to learn what our data can tell us. POS_CASH_BALANCE monthly data about previous point of sale or cash loans clients have had with Home Credit. There are 35 features with individual features raised to powers up to degree 3 and interaction terms. If we only have two unique values for a categorical variable such as Male Female then label encoding is fine but for more than 2 unique categories one hot encoding is the safe option. We can first examine the number of loans falling into each category. Let s look at this relationship in another way average failure to repay loans by age bracket. bureau_balance monthly data about the previous credits in bureau. In other words while two variables by themselves may not have a strong influence on the target combining them together into a single interaction variable might show a relationship with the target. When it comes time to build our machine learning models we will have to fill in these missing values known as imputation. io PythonDataScienceHandbook 05. com jsaguiar updated 0 792 lb lightgbm with simple features by Aguiar CREDIT_INCOME_PERCENT the percentage of the credit amount relative to a client s income ANNUITY_INCOME_PERCENT the percentage of the loan annuity relative to a client s income CREDIT_TERM the length of the payment in months since the annuity is the monthly amount due DAYS_EMPLOYED_PERCENT the percentage of the days employed relative to the client s ageAgain thanks to Aguiar and his great script https www. I added this code just to show what may be in store for this project and because it gets us a slightly better score on the leaderboard. 04 feature engineering. This will get us a Reciever Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve AUC ROC of 0. When we do the align we must make sure to set axis 1 to align the dataframes based on the columns and not on the rows The training and testing datasets now have the same features which is required for machine learning. com questions 132777 what does auc stand for and what is it. To deal with this we can perform one hot encoding followed by PCA http www. A kernel density estimate plot shows the distribution of a single variable https chemicalstatistician. Each current loan in the application data can have multiple previous loans. Then for each bin we calculate the average value of the target which tells us the ratio of loans that were not repaid in each age category. Handling the anomalies depends on the exact situation with no set rules. Making sure this data is as relevant to the task as possible is the job of the data scientist and maybe some automated tools https docs. The only way to tell for sure is to try them out BaselineFor a naive baseline we could guess the same value for all examples on the testing set. With these projects it s best to build up an understanding of the problem a little at a time rather than diving all the way in and getting completely lost Metric ROC AUCOnce we have a grasp of the data reading through the column descriptions https www. The submission files can be directly submitted to the competition from this tab or they can be downloaded to a local machine and saved. I write for Towards Data Science at https medium. nan in the testing data. When we build machine learning models we can try with and without these features to determine if they actually help the model learn. EXT_SOURCE_3 displays the greatest difference between the values of the target. To see these stats in years we can mutliple by 1 and divide by the number of days in a year Those ages look reasonable. We can also see that DAYS_BIRTH is positively correlated with EXT_SOURCE_1 indicating that maybe one of the factors in this score is the client age. Several of the new variables have a greater in terms of absolute magnitude correlation with the target than the original features. This runs the entire notebook and then lets us download any files that are created during the run. There are a total of 9 files 1 main file for training with target 1 main file for testing without the target 1 example submission file and 6 other files containing additional information about each loan. com willkoehrsen model tuning results random vs bayesian opt notebook I ll add more notebooks as I finish them Thanks for all the comments ImportsWe are using a typical data science stack numpy pandas sklearn matplotlib. The predictions represent a probability between 0 and 1 that the loan will not be repaid. Visualize New VariablesWe should explore these __domain knowledge__ variables visually in a graph. We will need to find a way to deal with these categorical variables Encoding Categorical VariablesBefore we go any further we need to deal with pesky categorical variables. html by their representation in the data to reflect this imbalance. 5 for all observations on the test set. In this case it is a common classification metric known as the Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve ROC AUC also sometimes called AUROC https stats. We followed the general outline of a machine learning project https towardsdatascience. The only downside to one hot encoding is that the number of features dimensions of the data can explode with categorical variables with many categories. com questions 806 advantages of auc vs standard accuracy Not that we know the background of the data we are using and the metric to maximize let s get into exploring the data. I hope this notebook was able to get you up and running in this machine learning competition and that you are now ready to go out on your own with help from the community and start working on some great problems __Running the notebook__ now that we are at the end of the notebook you can hit the blue Commit Run button to execute all the code at once. com visualizing data with pair plots in python f228cf529166 is a great exploration tool because it lets us see relationships between multiple pairs of variables as well as distributions of single variables. All three EXT_SOURCE featureshave negative correlations with the target indicating that as the value of the EXT_SOURCE increases the client is more likely to repay the loan. The actual assignment of the integers is arbitrary. There is some debate about the relative merits of these approaches and some models can deal with label encoded categorical variables with no issues. In this notebook we will use Label Encoding for any categorical variables with only 2 categories and One Hot Encoding for any categorical variables with more than 2 categories. Since we already know what score we are going to get we don t really need to make a naive baseline guess. See you in the next notebook This submission should score about 0. In this case since all the anomalies have the exact same value we want to fill them in with the same value in case all of these loans share something in common. I think and this is just a personal opinion for categorical variables with many classes one hot encoding is the safest approach because it does not impose arbitrary values to categories. csv file where there are only two columns SK_ID_CURR and TARGET. Here we are using the seaborn visualization library and the PairGrid function to create a Pairs Plot with scatterplots on the upper triangle histograms on the diagonal and 2D kernel density plots and correlation coefficients on the lower triangle. 5 in the competition random guessing on a classification task will score a 0. https datascience. No new columns are created. These predictions will also be available when we run the entire notebook. org stable modules generated sklearn. There is one row for every made payment and one row for every missed payment. For example if I wanted to build a model that could detect terrorists with 99. Back to Exploratory Data Analysis AnomaliesOne problem we always want to be on the lookout for when doing EDA is anomalies within the data. Clearly this would not be effective the recall would be zero and we use more advanced metrics such as ROC AUC or the F1 score https en. The ROC AUC may sound intimidating but it is relatively straightforward once you can get your head around the two individual concepts. The only change we will make from the default model settings is to lower the regularization parameter http scikit learn. There are two main ways to carry out this process Label encoding assign each unique category in a categorical variable with an integer. We will preprocess the data by filling in the missing values imputation and normalizing the range of the features feature scaling. In this notebook we will stick to using only the main application training and testing data. If you don t understand this code that s all right Plotting in Python can be overly complex and for anything beyond the simplest graphs I usually find an existing implementation and adapt the code don t repeat yourself In this plot the red indicates loans that were not repaid and the blue are loans that are paid. We will create a dataframe in this format from the test set and the predictions called submit. In the following code we create polynomial features using the EXT_SOURCE variables and the DAYS_BIRTH variable. Effect of Age on RepaymentAs the client gets older there is a negative linear relationship with the target meaning that as clients get older they tend to repay their loans on time more often. Testing Domain FeaturesNow we can test the domain features we made by hand. edu gareth ISL and Hands On Machine Learning with Scikit Learn and TensorFlow http shop. The other columns with DAYS in the dataframe look to be about what we expect with no obvious outliers. Once we run the notebook the files created are available in the Versions tab under the Output sub tab. org wiki Kernel_density_estimation KDE colored by the value of the target. org wiki F1_score to more accurately reflect the performance of a classifier. Therefore we will keep all of the columns for now. html for our first model. Label Encoding and One Hot EncodingLet s implement the policy described above for any categorical variable dtype object with 2 unique categories we will use label encoding and for any categorical variable with more than 2 unique categories we will use one hot encoding. They both teach with the mindset that the best way to learn is by doing and they are very effective To get a baseline we will use all of the features after encoding the categorical variables. Then we constructed new features out of the existing data to see if doing so could help our model. com willkoehrsen introduction to feature selection Intro to Model Tuning Grid and Random Search https www.

A machine learning model unfortunately cannot deal with categorical variables except for some models such as LightGBM http lightgbm. com interpreting interactions in regression to capture the effects of multiple variables but I do not see them used as often in machine learning. Some general interpretations of the absolute value of the correlation coefficent http www. Read in Data First we can list all the available data files. png A single line on the graph indicates the curve for a single model and movement along a line indicates changing the threshold used for classifying a positive instance. Therefore when we perform label encoding the model might use the relative value of the feature for example programmer 4 and data scientist 1 to assign weights which is not what we want. The predictions must be in the format shown in the sample_submission. Don t worry even if this code looks intimidating it s just a series of small steps that build up to a complete model. This is true for the most part as the winning models at least for structured data all tend to be variants on gradient boosting http blog. In later notebooks we will do more feature engineering https docs. com jsaguiar updated 0 792 lb lightgbm with simple features for exploring these features. In this frame of mind we can make a couple features that attempt to capture what we think may be important for telling whether a client will default on a loan. Understand the problem and the data2. The Area Under the Curve AUC http gim. __ Make Predictions using Engineered FeaturesThe only way to see if the Polynomial Features and Domain knowledge improved the model is to train a test a model on these features We can then compare the submission performance to that for the model without these features to gauge the effect of our feature engineering. Each previous application has one row and is identified by the feature SK_ID_PREV. Both of these books present the theory and also the code needed to make the models in R and Python respectively. Each row is one month of a previous credit and a single previous credit can have multiple rows one for each month of the credit length. Another option would be to drop columns with a high percentage of missing values although it is impossible to know ahead of time if these columns will be helpful to our model. In the example above programmer recieves a 4 and data scientist a 1 but if we did the same process again the labels could be reversed or completely different. com kaggle media competitions home credit home_credit. Exploratory Data AnalysisExploratory Data Analysis EDA is an open ended process where we calculate statistics and make figures to find trends anomalies patterns or relationships within the data. Given the correlations we saw in the exploratory data analysis we should expect that the most important features are the EXT_SOURCE and the DAYS_BIRTH. The threshold starts at 0 in the upper right to and goes to 1 in the lower left. com willkoehrsen automated model tuning Model Tuning Results https www. We can use a degree of 3 to see the results when we are creating polynomial features we want to avoid using too high of a degree both because the number of features scales exponentially with the degree and because we can run into problems with overfitting http scikit learn. png One hot encoding create a new column for each unique category in a categorical variable. com willkoehrsen intro to model tuning grid and random search Automated Model Tuning https www. The correlation is positive but the value of this feature is actually negative meaning that as the client gets older they are less likely to default on their loan ie the target 0. There are far more loans that were repaid on time than loans that were not repaid. Predicting whether or not a client will repay a loan or have difficulty is a critical business need and Home Credit is hosting this competition on Kaggle to see what sort of models the machine learning community can develop to help them in this task. To access the submission at the end of the notebook we will hit the blue Commit Run button at the upper right of the kernel. Each row is one month of a previous point of sale or cash loan and a single previous loan can have many rows. csv and an example of the expected submission file. This metric is between 0 and 1 with a better model scoring higher. 07 correlation coefficient this variable is likely going to be useful in a machine learning model because it does affect the target. In future notebooks we will look at incorporating more sources of data building more complex models by following the code of others and improving our scores. Once we get into more sophisticated machine learning models we can weight the classes http xgboost. The training application data comes with the TARGET indicating 0 the loan was repaid or 1 the loan was not repaid. previous_application previous applications for loans at Home Credit of clients who have loans in the application data. html by using the information from the other data sources. This will let us visualize the effect of this variable on the target. We will also not use any dimensionality reduction in this notebook but will explore in future iterations. The relationship is not very strong in fact they are all considered very weak http www. There are 7 different sources of data application_train application_test the main training and testing data with information about each loan application at Home Credit. image https raw. To make this graph first we cut the age category into bins of 5 years each. Going forward we will need to think about whatother domain knowledge features may be useful for this problem or we should consult someone who knows more about the financial industry This model scores about 0. __The logistic regression baseline should score around 0. These may be due to mis typed numbers errors in measuring equipment or they could be valid but extreme measurements. If we were using these predictions to classify applicants we could set a probability threshold for determining that a loan is risky. Since there are several models in this notebook there will be multiple output files. io en latest Features. Let s now look at the number of unique entries in each of the object categorical columns. Therefore we have to find a way to encode represent these variables as numbers before handing them off to the model. This is a great article on the subject https www.

The value assigned to each of the categories is random and does not reflect any inherent aspect of the category. For example we can create variables EXT_SOURCE_1 2 and EXT_SOURCE_2 2 and also variables such as EXT_SOURCE_1 x EXT_SOURCE_2 EXT_SOURCE_1 x EXT_SOURCE_2 2 EXT_SOURCE_1 2 x EXT_SOURCE_2 2 and so on. Here is a good Stack Overflow discussion https datascience. These features that are a combination of multiple individual variables are called interaction terms https en. html for those who want more information. This is a standard supervised classification task __Supervised__ The labels are included in the training data and the goal is to train a model to learn to predict the labels from the features __Classification__ The label is a binary variable 0 will repay loan on time 1 will have difficulty repaying loan DataThe data is provided by Home Credit http www. We will certainly best that in future work Again we see tha some of our features made it into the most important. com willkoehrsen automated feature engineering basics Advanced Automated Feature Engineering https www. nz cosc453 student_tutorials principal_components. This does not mean the bank should discriminate against younger clients but it would be smart to take precautionary measures to help younger clients pay on time. corr dataframe method. After the run is complete this should take about 10 minutes you can then access the files that were created by going to the versions tab and then the output sub tab. We see that all four of our hand engineered features made it into the top 15 most important This should give us confidence that our domain knowledge was at least partially on track. bureau data concerning client s previous credits from other financial institutions. Well that is extremely interesting It turns out that the anomalies have a lower rate of default. One hot encoding has created more columns in the training data because there were some categorical variables with categories not represented in the testing data. We will use the seaborn kdeplot for this graph. com WillKoehrsen Machine Learning Projects master label_encoding. __Follow up Notebooks__For those looking to keep working on this problem I have a series of follow up notebooks Manual Feature Engineering Part One https www. com questions 9443 when to use one hot encoding vs labelencoder vs dictvectorizor. That s a little confusing so we will take the absolute value of the feature and then the correlation will be negative. First we can make a histogram of the age. png Moreover we are provided with the definitions of all the columns in HomeCredit_columns_description. Each observation recieves a 1 in the column for its corresponding category and a 0 in all other new columns. Model interpretation just a little Machine learning competitions do differ slightly from typical data science problems in that we are concerned only with achieving the best performance on a single metric and do not care about the interpretation. credit_card_balance monthly data about previous credit cards clients have had with Home Credit. The training data has 307511 observations each one a separate loan and 122 features variables including the TARGET the label we want to predict. com 2013 06 09 exploratory data analysis kernel density estimation in r on ozone pollution data in new york and ozonopolis and can be thought of as a smoothed histogram it is created by computing a kernel usually a Gaussian at each data point and then averaging all the individual kernels to develop a single smooth curve. Exploratory Data Analysis4. It generally starts out with a high level overview then narrows in to specific areas as we find intriguing areas of the data. There are no outliers for the age on either the high or low end. When we measure a classifier according to the ROC AUC we do not generation 0 or 1 predictions but rather a probability between 0 and 1. First we extract the target column from the training data because this is not in the testing data but we need to keep this information. com c home credit default risk data helps immensely we need to understand the metric by which our submission is judged. An example is shown below image https raw. Let s use a slightly more sophisticated model for our actual baseline Logistic Regression. The objective of this competition is to use historical loan application data to predict whether or not an applicant will be able to repay a loan. 9999 accuracy I would simply make a model that predicted every single person was not a terrorist. For label encoding we use the Scikit Learn LabelEncoder and for one hot encoding the pandas get_dummies df function. com questions 235489 xgboost can handle missing data in the forecasting phase. com getting_started install. Most of the categorical variables have a relatively small number of unique entries. We also carried out an experiment to determine the effect of adding the engineering variables. Let s take a look at these variables. We are asked to predict the probability of not repaying the loan so if we are entirely unsure we would guess 0. We can calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between every variable and the target using the. The anomalous values seem to have some importance so we want to tell the machine learning model if we did in fact fill in these values. Then we performed a fairly simple EDA to try and identify relationships trends or anomalies that may help our modeling. The test set is considerably smaller and lacks a TARGET column. A curve that is to the left and above another curve indicates a better model. We want the probability the loan is not repaid so we will select the second column. This process may need to change as we get further into the project but for now we will see where this gets us. uk resources uploaded pearsons. As expected the most important features are those dealing with EXT_SOURCE and DAYS_BIRTH. com a complete machine learning walk through in python part one c62152f39420 1. Nonetheless we can try out a few to see if they might help our model to predict whether or not a client will repay a loan.
