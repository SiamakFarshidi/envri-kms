There are a lot of folders to work with. Invasive Ductal Carcinoma This is the most common subtype of all breast cancers. Create a new directory to store all available images check that the new diectory has been created This code copies all images from their seperate folders into the same folder called all_images_dir. To ensure privacy and patient confidentiality all images will be processed locally and never uploaded to an external server. Create a dataframe containing all the information Display a random sample of train images by class Balance the class distribution Create the train and val sets Create a Directory Structure Transfer the images into the folders Set Up the Generators Create the Model Architecture Train the Model Evaluate the model using the val set Plot the Training Curves Make a prediction on the val setWe need these predictions to calculate the AUC score print the Confusion Matrix and calculate the F1 score. com watch v gcFnyuc7Bew Part 1 IDC ModelIn this section we will create the IDC_model. Copy all images into one directoryThis will make it easier to work with this data. Sentinel Lymph Node A blue dye and or radioactive tracer is injected near the tumor. Project Objective The goal of this project is to create a web based tool that can batch analyze histopathology image patches and predict if breast cancer is present. The columns need to be oredered to match the output of the previous cell Get the true labels Get the predicted labels as probabilities Source Scikit Learn website http scikit learn. com vbookshelf Breast Cancer Analyzer Glossary of Terms Histopathology This inolves examining glass tissue slides under a microscope to see if disease is present. By deploying a machine learning solution as a web app it can be made available to medical personnel anywhere in the world for free. ConclusionIn part 2 we will use the same workflow to build a model to detect metastatic cancer. Generate a classification report For this to work we need y_pred as binary labels not as probabilities Use the command line conversion tool to convert the model Delete all_images_dir and base_dir directory to prevent a Kaggle error. Check the number of patient folders. Convert the model to from Keras to TensorflowjsThis conversion needs to be done so that the model can be loaded into the web app. 88 Metastatic_model Accuracy 0. Results Due to the large amount of high quality data that s available for training our models will produce the following results approx IDC_model Accuracy 0. Patch A patch is a small usually rectangular piece of an image. net publication 263052166_Automatic_detection_of_invasive_ductal_carcinoma_in_whole_slide_images_with_Convolutional_Neural_Networks 1399 H E stained sentinel lymph node sections of breast cancer patients the CAMELYON dataset Link https academic. Almost 80 of diagnosed breast cancers are of this subtype. The images that we will be using are all of tissue samples taken from sentinel lymph nodes. display the loss and accuracy curves make a prediction This is how to check what index keras has internally assigned to each class. Lymph Node This is a small bean shaped structure that s part of the body s immune system. What is the AUC Score Create a Confusion Matrix Create a Classification Report Recall Given a class will the classifier be able to detect it Precision Given a class prediction from a classifier how likely is it to be correct F1 Score The harmonic mean of the recall and precision. For example a 50x50 patch is a square patch containing 2500 pixels taken from a larger image of size say 1000x1000 pixels. A pathologist then examines this slide under a microscope. Therefore to allow them to be used in machine learning these digital images are cut up into Patches. This is based on a classification threshold of 0. These models will be loaded into a Tensorflowjs web app. The technology that enables this app to work is new. What files are available The images are grouped into 279 folders by patient_id. Kaggle allows a max of 500 files to be saved. The pathologist needs to visually scan large regions where there s no cancer in order to ultimately find malignant areas. 5GB Define Helper Functions Each file name has this format 14211_idx5_x2401_y1301_class1. In part 1 we will build the IDC_model and in part 2 the Metastatic_model. When using Safari for example you may see a message indicating that the model is loading but the app may actually be frozen. This model will predict whether or not Invasive Ductal Carcinoma is present. tif extension therefore we add it here get the label for a certain image these must match the folder names source path to image destination path to image move the image from the source to the destination check how many train images we have in each folder check how many val images we have in each folder End of Data Preparation Start of Model Building Note shuffle False causes the test dataset to not be shuffled Source https www. com watch v MCRtJDDrdcA This 1 46 video features Ian Ellis Professor of Cancer Pathology at Nottingham Universityhttps www. Link to Part 2 https www. A pathologist will be able to select which cancer he or she wants to detect submit many images at the same time and get an instant prediction indicating whether or not breast cancer is present in those images. It should be noted that the creators of the paper https www. Therefore I recommend using the latest version of the Chrome browser. Reference PapersThese are the papers that are associated with the two datasets that we will be using Automatic detection of invasive ductal carcinoma in whole slide images with Convolutional Neural Networks Link https www.

Essentially it punishes extreme values. Create a new directory CREATE FOLDERS INSIDE THE BASE DIRECTORY now we create 2 folders inside base_dir train_dir a_no_idc b_has_idc val_dir a_no_idc b_has_idc create a path to base_dir to which we will join the names of the new folders train_dir val_dir CREATE FOLDERS INSIDE THE TRAIN AND VALIDATION FOLDERS Inside each folder we create seperate folders for each class create new folders inside train_dir create new folders inside val_dir check that the folders have been created Set the id as the index in df_data Get a list of train and val images Transfer the train images the id in the csv file does not have the. The images are in png format. Metastatic Cancer A metastatic cancer or metastatic tumor is one that has spread from the site where it started into different area s of the body. Each patient folder has two sub folders that groups together images with the same class 0 or 1. Many thanks to Paul Mooney for making the Breast Histopathology Images dataset available on Kaggle. Lymph nodes filter substances that travel through the lymphatic fluid. The first lymph node reached by this injected substance is called the sentinel lymph node. In this case that would be examining tissue samples from lymp nodes in order to detect breast cancer. work Github https github. 94 All the html css and javascript code used to build the web app is available on Github. In part 2 I will also cover some lessons that I learned while building the app. What problem needs to be solved The process that s used to detect breast cancer is time consuming and small malignant areas can be missed. Live web app http histo. This dataset consists of 277 524 image patches of size 50x50 198 738 IDC negative and 78 786 IDC positive. Because these glass slides can now be digitized computer vision can be used to speed up a pathologist s workflow and provide diagnosis support. png split into a list the id is the first index in the list split into a list the target is part of the string in index 4 the ytarget i. com gpreda honey bee subspecies classification adjust size here draw a number of images for each location figure_cols is also the sample size What is the class distribution take a sample of the majority class 0 total 198738 take a sample of class 1 total 78786 concat the two dataframes Check the new class distribution train_test_split stratify y creates a balanced validation set. Put the predictions into a dataframe. Results Our cnn model will achieve an accuracy and F1 score that is approximately 0. We will create the models in two kernels. The web app will be able to detect two forms of breast cancer Invasive Ductal Carcinoma IDC Metastatic CancerWe will create two CNN models an IDC_model and a Metastatic_model. These need to match the order shown above. com gigascience article 7 6 giy065 5026175 What is the potential of computational pathology This is what two experts have to say This is a 1 21 video featuring Prof Jeroen van der Laak a co author of the CAMELYON paper.
