Implement the forward function below by composing the given modules SelfAttention LayerNorm and mlp according to the diagram below. For a specific prediction we would like to retrieve relevant information from the dictionary. py Section 2 Queries keys and values Time estimate 40mins Video 2 Queries Keys and ValuesOne way to think about attention is to consider a dictionary that contains all information needed for our task. You may want to use the transpose function Matrix Multiplication between the keys and queries size b h t t row wise normalization of weights Matrix Multiplication between the output of the key and queries multiplication and values. Thin fat people can never really be attractive.
