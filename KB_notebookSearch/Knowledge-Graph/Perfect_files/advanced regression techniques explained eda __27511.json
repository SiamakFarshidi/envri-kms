These additional transformation I am making to make a competition submission. I thought of adding polynomial importance raising to power of 2 or 3. Effectively data collection has been done and one clear business objective is set. 1stFlrSF increases as TotalBsmtSF increases seems very logical to me 4. html DATA CLEANINGwell said Everyone like to work with data when it is clean and no painstaking efforts needed to clean and transform it. com views AdvancedHousingPriceDashboard Dashboard1 embed y display_count yes publish yes It became apparent that the variables TotalBsmtSF LotArea and YearBuilt have positive correlation with the outcome or target variable SalePrice. Next moving on to Data Preparation. YearBuilt vs GarageArea GarageCars 0. I came to know that it would be good to make a feature engineering on that attribute Label Encoding I would recommend any who is new to ML and Data Science to get a copy of this Book Hands On Machine Learning with Scikit Learn and Tensorflow https www. 55 The best insight that I gained is yet to come. I am not going to make my pairplot uglier and less intuitive by including all the variables. I used the below line of code to group all the variables according to its datatypeOut of all the above integer type variables it can be easily seen that all the year related variables OverallCond and MSSubClass variable is actually should be categorical in nature but are in Numeric form. com c house prices advanced regression techniques data to understand the data varaibles better. The Data contains variables of type integer float and object types however we can expect many categorical variables. com pagead aclk sa L ai DChcSEwi8oLievcbgAhVvk 0KHaeyBTEYABAGGgJkZw ohost www. com display doc Normality Testing Skewness and Kurtosis desktop true macroName sv translation Always there is a confusion in the statistics world and ML world between begineers which is right or left Positive or Negative in other sense This article explains the picture perfectly. I also tried if there is any variable that could possibly bring the prices down as it increase. TotalRmsAbvGrd vs GrLivArea 0. Though I was a finance graduate and have a penchant towards investment and risk management I dont really have as much interest in Real Estate as I do have in stock markets. I am going to only include and infer the top 10 variables that have high correlation with SalePrice and even with that top 10 I am going to ignore one out of the two variables that exhibit multi collinearity. GarageArea with GarageCars. My client was very eager curious and in a haste to implement the model into his website and see result. Hmm 222 variables for a comparitively medium sized dataset. However as most of the variables are dummy encoding and represent information in a binary form. Clearly as the quality goes up 1 being the lowest and 10 being the highest the median of the SalePrice goes up. SIX PHASES OF CRISP DM Business Understanding Data Understanding Data Preparation Modelling Evaluation Deployment This stage is out of scope as we are not integrating or deloying a model for production PHASE 1 BUSINESS UNDERSTANDINGI strongly believe that the first objective of any Data Scientist should be to throughly understand the problem from a business perspective obtain the project objectives and requirements from the client and then converting this knowledge into a data mining problem definition. With 79 explanatory variables describing almost every aspect of residential homes in Ames Iowa this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home. In our case we have considered the 4 variables TotalBsmtSF LotArea YearBuilt and OverallQual to be the driving features assuming that they are however we may face surprising events down the line It is very imperative to understand the distribution of all these variables and transform it if necessary Here is where the transformations come into play CORRELATIONS I decided to create a correlation matrix and then a simple visualization showing the correlations between these feature variables and our target variable SalePrice in order to easily inspect ve and ve correlations. Exploration often leads to the discovery unexpected trends patterns missing data issues outliers and other significant problems if not addressed could potentially result in inaccurate or misleading results and conclusions. Also another variable I would assume that could greatly influence the price would be the Quality of the property or the material used to build the property. One very good lesson learnt is to restructure my ML model flow by starting with Oultier removal as the first step of Data Prep and Cleaning right before handling missing values and other mandatory stepsPoints Removed TotBsSF SalePrice 1 3138 184750 2 6110 160000 Feature Engineering Encoding and Dummy Variables Data Transformation There are some variables that I came across are categorical values. Given the situation that there is a constraint on my knowledge in the Real Estate domain and the limited size of our dataset I wish to remove only the most extreme points As you can see the 3 guys extremely isolated from the normal crowd 2 guys in the first plot and 1 guy in the second and I am going to remove themWe can now see that there are only 2 oultier data points because one observation is repetitive in both of the cases. Convenience original values to percentages or degrees Standardization Normalization 2. As soon as I knew that there was a price column my unusual behaviour started kicking in. This could highly influence our model as computer language or even ML Models can only understand numbers than categories. Let s check the SalePrice movements over the years Last but not the least Inorder to proceed further in data cleaning and transformations It is always of prime importance to check the distribution of all the numeric variables involved in the study most importantly the target variable SalePrice. Handling Missing Values 3. DATA UNDERSTANDING DATA EXPLORATIONMost of the time this phase of a data mining project is skipped or the importance is undermined. In any ML project cleaning and transforming the data takes about 70 percent of the time. For instance let s consider OverallQual vs price or investment to buy or build a property. Some unusual correlations that seems like a causation to me rather than a correlation are. com cid CAESEeD2dCXiIBMclNmhdWYsVX_T sig AOD64_2fdY9qzvEDU3X4phSrlKjIn6mnAQ ctype 5 q ved 0ahUKEwjc6rGevcbgAhWTonEKHYTnDAUQ9A4IpwE adurl. Due to the reson that we have more variables under study it would ask anyone going through this kernel to take a look at this page https www. It s still fine and we are on the safer side. When I was back working in one of the world s largest investment bank I had a habit of checking the historical price movements of the securities that s been traded by our cleints. I realize that my Kernel is a bit long and that why I have added some memes and quotes to keep the reader active. This is one of the challenges that puts skills to test as the data is mulivariate in nature 81 columns under consideration and in addition to that kaggle recommends to use Advanced Regression Techniques such as Random Forest Light Gradient Boosting Extreme Gradient Boosting Techniques to solve the problem. Reducing Skewness for numeric variables Right Skewness log or root transformation Left Skewness square transformation 3. However that s not the often. There is multicollinearity between the square feet varibles TotalBsmtSF and 1stFlrSF and between the GarageCars and GarageArea. Let s do some charts to explore that as well. The author has explicitly recommends 3 methods to deal missing values 1. I would first learn those concepts comprehend it and would see if any improvements can be made on that and will induce those ideas into my kernel. Equal Spreads Though variables have different mean it is always easy to handle them if they have equal spead or variation Homoscedasticity 4. If you want to know more about the crisis here is a short and crisp video explained by an investment legend Warren Buffett link https www. Kindly forgive me for that I have given reference to all the materials that have helped me in writing this kernel. Also do check this video to understand how log and exponent are related and what these transformations mean. Categorical to Dummy VariablesInorder to help my model better understand what data its going to face I am converting all the encoded variables into dummy variables aka one hot encoding. The data contains 1460 instances records and 81 columns. Obviously this may be due to the 2008 crisis where most of the mortgages went default and there is huge loss incurred to AIG. Also when included in the study it feels like running a correlation between student ID in the unversity and their grade One thing that was pinching me in my was the price movement. This is what I have found Alley Type of alley access to property Grvl Gravel Pave Paved NA No Alley access NA means No Alley Access. A review and critique of data mining process models in 2009 called the CRISP DM the de facto standard for developing data mining and knowledge discovery projects. I thank everyone who took the time and patience to go through my work If you have learnt benefited or if you find this notebook helpful Likes and forks would be much appreciated and that would motivate me re iterate the kernel with new ideas. on a broader view however this can be broken down further Hence just to have a quick sneakpeak I proceeded further to visualize the data in Tableau in order to see if that has any correlation with the SalePrice. Data Preparation tasks are likely to be performed multiple times and not in any specific order. Set the values to some value zero mean median mode using fillna function Let s Check if our dataset has anyThis is the step that almost changed my thinking on how to clean the missing values. Inorder to avoid such bias it should be converted to categorical. However you need to know when to say no to certain things and when not to skip a process. Some findings from the correlation heatmap are as follows 1. Also in the bottom most area chart it is evident that from 1940 till 2010 the average SalePrice is in an upward trend and if you can notice that sale price plummeting after 2008 before rising. 54 this seems interesting to think as things modernize spending increases lifestyle changes and transportation and convenience changes as each individual prefer having seperate cars for their convenience thereby requiring more space in Garage. TotalRmsAbvGrd vs FullBath 0. It is my duty now to make him her understand that data collection shoud be precise and ignoring a structured and quality data collection process could cost him and hurt the model I learned about data cleaning process from the famous Hands On Machine Learning with Scikit Learn and Tensorflow https www. I saw some intersting ideas such as stackedRegression models and advanced feature engineering from amazing minds in our community. After taking a deeper look at the variables out of all the variables few variables seemed promising. Creating dummies for Categorical variables as machines can only 0 and 1 better For example even as a Human being it is difficult for me to understand which neighbourhood is expensive to dwell in just by the name of the neighbourhoodI found an amazing blog that perfectly explains what these transformations are what problems does they address and to which situations they can be applied. KitchenAbvGr is the only variable with 0. However 3 4 times as many people reported using CRISP DM. As per the article Skewness between 0. A possible consequence of neglecting this step is to expend a great deal of time effort and resources in producing the answers to the wrong questions. it is well known that no of cars that can be parked in th garage increase with the increase in space3. A groundbreaking insight that s been playing hide and seek with us now brought to light. It is a data mining process model that describes commonly used approaches that expert data miners use to tackle problems. Tasks Cleaning munging and manipulation of the data to cater our end goal Transformations Feature selection and Feature engineering to aid and improve the accuracy and performance of our model. Often the client has many competing objectives and contraints that must be properly balanced. Firstly I almost removed the columns that had missing values and almost bulit the pipeline for models and this is where everything changed. However we cannot restrict and build model out of these variables as it will lead to bias and most importantly considering all other features and building a better model is the ultimate aim of this notebook. In this case let s say for example the year 2000 will be given less importance than year 2018 as we know numerically 2018 is greater than 2000. Hence we can make a log or Sqrt transformation to normalize the data to nomally distributed form MODELING AND EVALUATIONAnd we came to the end ElasticNet wins over other model. This is my 2nd kernel Actually this my 1st one the earlier one I posted for the sake of getting used to the kaggle way and personally feel its a bit long. Data cleaning concepts were clearly explained in the book. They are GrLivArea Living Area GarageCars no of cars the garage can hold and space 1stFlrSF first floor square feet Yes of course I love a vast first floor area FullBath who doesn t love a big fat bath tub and bath space to drench themselves like a hippo. To my surprise LotArea is missingThere are also other significant variables that I missed during the earlier sneakpeak and that s the beauty of EDA. Data is of pretty decent size for analysis however in reality more the data better the results would be. This is where you are able to see through things that can never be seen or understood that easily without an exploratory study. Hence considering all the economic classes in the society we need to drill further to get an idea of how these secondary features could add value to our Machine Learning model. edu repec bocode t transint. Missing ValuesI personally consider dealing with missing values is very prominent as it can significantly affect the size of the data from the ML model perspective. Create Polynomial Features also can be included in feature engineering 5. Ignoring missing values can significantly impact the size of the data as well as the quality of the results. I took a look at the documentation provided and it gave me goosebumps. It is very obvious that diagonal points of a correlation matrix are highly correlated 1 always as it is the same column it is correlating with2. How does he determine the value of the same I came to a conclusion that if I am going to buy a property I would definitely be interested in the following area of the property How old or new the property is Is it brand new or a renovated one Loaction of the property City Town Sub urbs or rural. I recommend everyone taking a look at it http fmwww. I would try to revise and reiterate the kernel very soon. PCA Stacked Models and more feature engineering coming soon Stay Tuned. Removing unncessary variables such as ID 2. This greatly helps in ignoring features and better feature selection because they do not add any new variance or non linearity to our model. Most of Machine Learning Models assume that the data is normally distributed. Since Most of the Machine Learning models assume the underlying data to be normally distributed we will try to converge and address the skewness issue Skewness Explained https help. I am applying this rule to adjust the skewness and give my model what it expects. Since the OverallQual is a categorical variable actually here is it in an integer format but it describes the category of the quality on a scale of 1 to 10 we would compare OverallQual vs SalePrice to see if any interesting insights we could get. Let s get it Started Kaggle states the problem as follows Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house and they probably won t begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east west railroad. I was thinking what a common man would analyze if he she is going to buy a property. It s so Fascinating to know that one single plot could lead to numerous insights and proves some assumptions wrong. The only other data mining standards named in these polls was SEMMA. Get rid of the whole attribute if necessary using drop function 3. As in our data Garage and Area related variables have significant relationship with SalePrice Target Variable. The more you spend the better the product quality will be Just to try out as a traditional approach Though I dont believe that I could get any meaningful insights out of it I am going to run a Correlation Heat Map for all the variables Except Id variable is simply ridiculous and a lurking variable. GrLivArea vs FullBath 0. I could have just used the training set data with cross validation to write the entire kernel as we don t have Y labels for the test set to compare and compute the error. Firstly I did this plot to see the skewness in the promising numerical predictor variables and our most important SalePrice Variable. It is clearly visible from the above chart that the data has Right Positive Skewness. Not to my surprise most missing value columns have this convention followedI really want to know who created and collected this dataset and was thinking to say a big thank you to him her for making me waste my precious time. As per the documentation Functional is a column describing the home functionality. In addition to that I strongly suggest you to go back to the correlation matrix above and check the second row that relates OverallQual with all other variables. One Last Step before modelling Transforming the SalePrice Variable. Certainly There are some other auxilliary features that one would look at while buying a property might include Bedroom no of bedrooms and other associated attributes such as the finish quality no of bedrooms etc Kitchen type of kitchen kitchen spacea and other assoicated attributes such as kitchen exterior no of kitchens etc PoolArea Pool Area and other associated attributes GarageCars Garage Area and other assoicated attributes However There were other characteristics which I felt were totally unnnecessary to be considered such as Alley LandSlope LotShape etc but however it is very subjective in nature and the preferences change from person to person. Fortunately there is a variable named as OverallQual that depicts the same. Polls conducted in 2002 2004 and 2007 show that it is the leading methodology used by data miners. Building an Machine Learning Model that gets integrated into a web application Assumption that helps customer gain insights about the real estate market and gives recommendations on the salesprice of the various property across the city region. Now I am going to remove these points. But this playground competition s dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white picket fence. I decided to conclude my exploration. Some of the Data Preparation steps that will notebook covers are as follows Data Cleaning includes 1. CRISP DM stands for Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining. Some notable points to carry forward are as follows SalePrice has Right skewness or Positive skewness because of the fact that only rich can afford expensive properties GrLiveArea TotalBsmtSF TotRmsAbvGrd YearBuilt has skewness associated with them with only YearBuilt having left skewness and other having Right Skewness Clear cut outlier points can be noted in TotalBsmtSF and GrLivArea May be need to check on that during Data Prep GrLivArea vs SalePrice There are two outlier on the minimum side with a large living area and lower sale price. I am quite dissappointed to find out that the variable YearBuilt to be a categorical variable as It had some serious exponential relationship with the SalePrice. Data Exploration is the most important step in any data mining project as it can uncover many hidden insights and can act as a land mine detector while we were walking towards our end goal. May be those properties are reportedly have paranormal activity this is why I hate large houses Actually I can afford those though TotalBsmtSF vs SalePrice There is an outlier with Large Basement Surface Area and very low SalePrice Many data clouds possess linearity Nothing new as we know this is going to happen as told by our sooth sayer corr_matrix SalePrice vs YearBuilt looks Polynomial this is very interesting though SalePrice of the properties built in the late 2000 s seems to have increased exponentially Life always seems to play unfair with 90 s kids YearBuilt vs YearRemodAdd a strong linear trend occurrence can be seen for the newly built homes or properties. DATA PREPARATIONThe Data preparation phase covers all activities to construct the final dataset data that will be fed into modelling phase from the initial raw data. com watch v k2VSSNECLTQ. Though the features having too many missing values I felt hesitant to drop the features though they are not strongly correlated with our target variable. Moreover I would love a surround and an audio system Its a personal choice though YearRemodAdd Re modelled year else if its a new property then the value is same as the Built year for that observation Let s Build our correlation matrix Note that we are not building the heatmap for all the variables under study but for the top 15 variables and visually inspect the relationship. I personally expec myself to have learnt advanced predictive modelling once completing the kernel. Outlier Removal There are many reasons for Data Transformation. After a good amount of homework I came to a conclusion to impute the values rather than dropping the columns. Feel free to look at the dashboard by clicking this link https public. Get rid of the corresponding row using dropna function 2. In the second chapter the author has broken down each phases of an ML Pipeline into simple and intuitive steps. 135907 weak negative correlation Practically the larger the area the more the price of the property is. He has clearly described what LabelEncoder is and how does it works. we can use the corr function to find the pearson s coefficientFantastic Earlier I mentioned 4 variables TotalBsmtSF LotArea YearBuilt and OverallQual that could be the major predictor for the SalePrice and a big Yes from the correlation results 3 of the 4 variables are in the top 10 predictor variables that has higher positive correlations with the SalePrice Target. All those valuable and gold standard insights gonna help us slay and lay the foundation for building our model. finally I will deliver it to my client and hope he will be happy. Here I am going to assume and put myself in a postion as a Data Scientist facing a client running an online website which generates revenue by acting as a broker online consultancy platform providing solutions and recommendations to its customers intersted in buying mortgages and properties. One of the vital phases which could significantly improve our model s performance. Given this there are many options to handle outliers. 5 is consider approximately symmetric. I have to be very cautious in removing the data observations as I have already dropped my Y values from fulldata concat of train and test data I will delete the rows corresponding to these two rows. I tried looking at the negative correlation between variables and found that no variable has strong negative correlation with SalePrice. OverallQual has strong positive correlationship with all the other 9 variables out of top 10 variables that has high positive correlationship with SalePrice. I always check how the prices have significantly moved over years and would think If I could travel back in time and buy those securities at that time so that I don t want to work ever and JUST travel Europe cheap and an impossible to happen wish I should say. It is clearly mentioned as below Home functionality Assume typical unless deductions are warranted There are two missing values in this column and I am going to give them the value for Typical Typ OutliersDealing with outliers requires knowledge about the outlier the dataset and possibly domain knowledge. Kindly upvote if you believe its useful INTRODUCTIONkaggle is one of the great platforms in the world of Data Science to get exposed to the various kinds of problems that ML DS could solve. The below is the simple dashboard that I have generated using Tableau. Usually it is not recommended to have such proportions as it may lead to overfitting problems. Most common reasons include but not limited to 1. It is of Everest Importance to check the distribution of this variable as this one single hurdle will topple our fast moving car off the highway into the woods. DATA TRANSFORMATIONSData transformation is very vital for any data that contains numeric variables as it may have Positive or Negative skewness. Really dont you get any other words or characters such as None 0 or any mayan language character to get filled with. CRISP DM METHODOLOGYThe methodology that I am going to follow to address the problem is called as CRISP DM.
