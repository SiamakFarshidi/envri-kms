Predicting Breast Cancer From Nuclear Shape The nucleus is an organelle present within all eukaryotic cells including human cells. The measurements were made from digital images of a fine needle aspirate of a breast tissue mass. Step 5 Preprocess Data Step 6 Describe Processed Data Here with this heatmap we can see that big mis shapen nuclei are typicaly from cancerous samples. pap smear tests and the diagnosis of cervical cancer. chdir Users ptm desktop Current_working_directory trainingData pd. That is pretty good In order to improve the accuracty of our model however we will need to add back some of the features that we previously removed and we will need to engineer some new features. Great This means that our classification algorithms should have somethinggood to work with. Abberant nuclear shape can be used to identify cancer cells e. Let s explore that in more detail. For more information please refer to the following resources http www. Step 7 Compare Classification Algorithms It looks like our model can predict with about 90 accuracty whether or not a given sample is malignant. edu levy_lab Vukovic LD Jevtic P Edens LJ Levy DL. 2016 New Insights into Mechanisms and Functions of Nuclear Size Regulation. This confirms my prediction that healthy nuclei have a default size and that cancer cells have a wide range of sizes typically greater than the default size. Int Rev Cell Mol Biol. com paultimothymooney predicting breast cancer from nuclear shape os. Let s look at all of the features now. These additions can be found in the following kernel https www. This script takes as an input the CSV file from the Kaggle Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset https www. Next we will identify a suitable classification algorithm that we can use to predict whether or not a given sample is malignant. Nuclear structure in cancer cells. Sizing up the nucleus nuclear shape size and nuclear envelope assembly. boxplot algorithm comparison predictions model. Likewise a growing body of literature suggests that there is some connection between the shape of the nucleus and human disease states such as cancer and aging. predict c print accuracy_score d predictions print Logistic Regression Training set accuracy s accuracy_score d predictions. The output of this script is a prediction of whether or not a given sample is cancerous. As such the quantitative analysis of nuclear size of shape has important biomedical applications. csv Get rid of the space in the file name Run the function Furthermore we will need to split up our training data setting aside 20 of the training data for cross validation testing such that we can avoid potentially overfitting the data. com uciml breast cancer wisconsin data containing information on various features describing the size and shape of the nucleus. Step 1 Import Modules Step 2 Describe Data Step 3 Minimze and Describe Dataset Step 4 Plot Data I predict that the nuclei from the malignant samples were larger than the nuclei from the benign samples.
