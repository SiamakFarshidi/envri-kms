Exploratory Data Analysis 2. Random Forest The Random Forest Classifier is a set of decision trees from randomly selected subset of training set. If there is any suggestion or any specific topic you would like me to cover kindly mention that in the comments. However it is more widely used in classification problems in the industry. Have Multiple features and one target variable. As it seems in the below graph the mission is to fit as many instances as possible between the lines while limiting the margin violations. Lasso Regression Lasso regression is a type of linear regression that uses shrinkage. Gradient Boosting Classifier Gradient boosting is one of the most powerful techniques for building predictive models. This class supports both dense and sparse input and the multiclass support is handled according to a one vs the rest scheme. XGboost Regression 1. Linear Support Vector Classification Similar to SVC with parameter kernel linear but implemented in terms of liblinear rather than libsvm so it has more flexibility in the choice of penalties and loss functions and should scale better to large numbers of samples. The idea of boosting came out of the idea of whether a weak learner can be modified to become better. This best decision boundary is called a hyperplane. Accuracy classification score. Exploratory Data Analysis 1. SVM The goal of the SVM algorithm is to create the best line or decision boundary that can segregate n dimensional space into classes so that we can easily put the new data point in the correct category in the future. 5 It represents an upper bound on the fraction of training errors and a lower bound of the fraction of support vectors. Simple Linear Regression 1. Decision Tree Regression Decision Trees are divided into Classification and Regression Trees. Shrinkage is where data values are shrunk towards a central point like the mean. For example if we analyzing the production of chemical synthesis in terms of temperature at which the synthesis take place in such cases we use quadratic model. Support Vector Regression Support Vector regression is a type of Support vector machine that supports linear and non linear regression. EDA on Iris Flower DataAs you can see Length 150 range index Features are float except for Id which is integer Target variables are object that is like string Scatter Plot SepalWidth vs PetalWidth of different Species Countplot of Flower Species Pairplot of Various attributes 1. y a b1x b2 2 e 4. It aggregates the votes from different decision trees to decide the final class of the test object. Gradient boosting is a greedy algorithm and can overfit a training dataset quickly. Decision Tree A decision tree is a decision support tool that uses a tree like graph with model of decisions and their possible consequences. I am doing this only after completing various courses in this field. For many data sets it produces a highly accurate classifier. Polynomial Regression 1. artificial neural networks tend to outperform all other algorithms or frameworks. KNN can be used for both classification and regression predictive problems. GB builds an additive model in a forward stage wise fashion. The parameter which is different from SVC is as follows nu float optional default 0. The lasso procedure encourages simple sparse models i. It is an ensemble tree based learning algorithm. My motive is to make this the ultimate reference to Machine Learning for beginners and experienced people alike. In prediction problems involving unstructured data images text etc. CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS 0. KNN captures the idea of similarity sometimes called distance proximity or closeness. Multiple Linear Regression 1. Ideal for contemporary applications in digital advertisement e commerce web page categorization text classification bioinformatics proteomics banking services and many other areas. Ensemble algorithms are those which combines more than one algorithms of same or different kind for classifying objects. The goal of multiple regression is to model the linear relationship between your independent variables and your dependent variable. Naive Bayes Classification 2. I continue to study more advanced concepts to provide more knowledge and content. IntroductionSince Second Year in my Bachelor s Degree I have been fascinated by the topic of Machine Learning. A weak hypothesis or weak learner is defined as one whose performance is at least slightly better than random chance. Naive Bayes Naive Bayes is a statistical classification technique based on Bayes Theorem. This assumption simplifies computation and that s why it is considered as naive. SVM algorithm can be used for Face detection image classification text categorization etc. It is a way to display an algorithm that only contains conditional control statements. The violation concept in this example represents as \u03b5 epsilon. Nu Support Vector Classification It is like SVC but NuSVC accepts slightly different sets of parameters. Supervised learning. This will enable us to apply Linear Regression to given Data. Regression trees are needed when the response variable is numeric or continuous. Solution of multiclass classification problems with any number of classes. Lasso Regression 1. y ax b where y target x feature and a parameter of model In regression problems target value is continuously varying variable such as price of house or sacral_slope. This assumption is called class conditional independence. Birds of a feather flock together. Even if these features are interdependent these features are still considered independently. A decision tree is a flowchart like structure in which each internal node represents a test on an attribute e. whether a coin flip comes up heads or tails each branch represents the outcome of the test and each leaf node represents a class label decision taken after computing all attributes. 7 CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS 2 1. Simple Linear RegressionSimple Linear regression is a basic and commonly used type of predictive analysis. Have only one feature and one target variable. This piece explains a Decision Tree Regression Model practice with Python. Logistic Regression Logistic Regression is used when the dependent variable target is categorical. The data points or vectors that are the closest to the hyperplane and which affect the position of the hyperplane are termed as Support Vector. Logistic Regression 2. We have converted 3 Species into Numerical Values. This kernel is prepared to be a container of many broad topics in the field of Machine Learning. Some important things This kernel is a work in progress so every time you see on your home feed and open it you will surely find fresh content. Decision Tree Classification 2. For Example To predict whether an email is spam 1 or 0 Whether the tumor is malignant 1 or not 0 Logistic regression is named for the function used at the core of the method the Logistic Function also called Sigmoid Function. Linear Support Vector Classification 2. Random Forest Classification 2. In many cases linear model will not work out. In other words similar things are near to each other. In simple regression we try to minimise the error rate. It is one of the most accurate learning algorithms available. EDA On King County House Sale DataAs you can see Length 21613 range index Features are int and float except for Date which is object Target variable PRICE is float. models with fewer parameters. It can handle thousands of input variables without variable deletion. If you like my work be sure to upvote this kernel so it looks more relevant and meaningful to the community. Classification trees as the name implies are used to separate the dataset into classes belonging to the response variable. K Nearest Neighbor The KNN algorithm assumes that similar things exist in close proximity. Upvote the Kernel if you found it helpful. Compute confusion matrix to evaluate the accuracy of a classification. Nu Support Vector Classification 2. Decision Tree Regression 1. KNN is used for recommending products on Amazon posts on Facebook movies on Netflix or videos on YouTube. 9 End Of Notebook 100 REGRESSION ALGORITHMS 0. png attachment image.

Multiple Linear RegressionMultiple Linear regression is a basic and commonly used type of predictive analysis. XGboost Regression XGBoost is a decision tree based ensemble Machine Learning algorithm that uses a gradient boosting framework. However when it comes to small to medium structured tabular data decision tree based algorithms are considered best in class right now. Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the effect of a particular feature in a class is independent of other features. Polynomial RegressionPolynomial Regression is a form of linear regression in which the relationship between the independent variable x and dependent variable y is modeled as an nth degree polynomial. While in SVR we try to fit the error within a certain threshold. For example a loan applicant is desirable or not depending on his her income previous loan and transaction history age and location.
