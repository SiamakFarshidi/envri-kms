Please unhide the code below to see the full structure of the dictionary. There are other types of files that are accepted such as geoJson but generally the most common types that one would come across are the two aforementioned formats. js plot will be interactive and dynamic where one is able to invoke zoomable animations at different regions and clusters with the click of a mouse button. js can take in are usually of the format. To quote Wikipedia s page the D3. json file to be read back by the javascript for plotting. js visualsTo plot the D3 visuals we first need to feed into it the HTML structure that will be used to embed our D3 SVG Scalable Visual Graphic object. js kaggle scripts are now not able to be run the way they were before before. org mbostock 7607535. Circle packing also displays hierarchy where you can get smaller clusters of circles packed within a bigger circle which itself is arranged next to or within other circles given its hierarchical nature it is no surprise that circle packing is also sometimes known as the circular treemap. However unlike this static figure the D3. Javascript embeddingNext we need to feed the base javascript that will ultimately be used to power our D3 plots. js visualizations within IPython notebooks. js with kernels on a consistent and a quality basis is Triskelion https www. Nonetheless the class feature seems like a most interesting column to investigate and plot especially given the context of this kernel which is to showcase the circle packing visuals. Data Preparation of the input JSON file json 3. However with the revamping of kernel interface and the backend unfortunately it seems that Triskelion s old D3. js functions to generate rich text graphic charts and diagrams. As a base script I will use Mike Bostocks excellent example Zoomable Circle packing https bl. Data preparation of Json fileTo start off we first concern ourselves with preparing the data to be fed into D3. Do check out his work as they are of top notch quality and incidentally he was the Kaggler that really got me intrigued with Kernels. org is a javascript library which was created with the intent on serving beautiful interactive and dynamic visualizations on web browsers and was developed by the team of Jeff Heer Mike Bostock and Vadim Ogievetsky of Stanford University s Stanford Visualization Group. In a commercial or business setting you would ultimately want to implement some programmatic process that models your json file based on the data e. json Javascript object notation as well as. misc import imread sing cv2. However the free space also has its pros as it does not clutter up the entire view when one looks at the plot which make actually make for more appealing visuals. js I will simply identify groupings within the different classes and manually feed that into the json object based off the values obtained from the variables plain punctuation date et al NOTE this is not good programming and only used here for brevity and convenience. IntroductionIn this notebook I will demonstrate how to embed D3. The picture show below is a taste of what we will be going to create in the latter sections of this notebook. For the purposes of this kernel in showcasing the visualisation capabilties of D3. For example in the DATE class there are many different years provided but I want to visually identify all the dates after year 2000 as a child circle within the Date circle and therefore I store all dates after year 2000 as a sub dictionary code below. Large datasets can be easily bound to SVG objects using simple D3. Sounds interesting If so let us proceed. js plots has proven to be rather technically challenging on Kaggle notebooks and the only one that I have come across that has managed to do integrate D3. These objects can also be widely styled using CSS. The drawing power of this library is that unlike other visualization tools where one is constrained in the type of plot that she he can call e. Note the one drawback of the circle packing method is that it is not very space efficient as compared to a standard rectangular as there is a lot of unused space in the visuals. js library uses pre built JavaScript functions to select elements create SVG objects style them or add transitions dynamic effects or tooltips to them. a Data Driven Documents https d3js. Plotting D3 visuals via embedding Javascript plot Let s go What is Circle packing The particular type of visualisation I want to showcase is known as circle packing which is the arrangement of circles inside some demarcation so that none of the circles overlap. finding groupings or clusters within a class text using some clustering method and feeding those clusters as sub circles within the outer parent json nodes. It has been acknowledged that visualizing D3. Investigating the Class feature for groupings to add to the circle packing circle_pack 2. In fact the mathematics of circle packing can indeed get quite extensive but from a visual standpoint it allows one to easily and intuitively observe clusters of similar concepts based on how tightly the circles are packed. Plotting the D3. The visualisation should therefore help us to intutitvely identify clusters by size as well as their associated values. Having created the structure that we want to visualise out data with we can now proceed to modify the Python dictionary into a json file which we can then feed into D3 for plotting. I have hidden the code for neatness but feel free to unhide the cell to peruse the full thing. bar charts line radial plots etc D3 allows a user to customize the final visuals to a very fine degree of granularity whilst keeping in line with the web standards of HTML5 CSS and SVG. CLICK ON THE OUTSIDE IF YOU WANT TO GET BACK TO THE ORIGINAL VIEW. This notebook is arranged according to these chapters 1. One should really write code to dynamically create the json. Load in the training data as follows. To do this we use the json module and by invoking the function dump we are able to conveniently send each element in the dictionary off into a json file of our choosing here in this case output. js plots and become of use to those visualization enthusiasts out there. Brief history on D3. Note that there are not many columns in our dataset. By calling the pandas dataframe method value_counts we now have a clearer picture of Circle packing the Class featureThe plan therefore is to simply look at some of the categories within the class feature of the data dive deeper within each category and look at what are the values associated to each category and then plot clusters of the values and class categories within a circle packed treemap. Also the groupings do not explicitly exist so you are free to use your creativity to model any groupings you may want to particularly display or potentially use some sort of latent or clustering model to learn the groupings from the data. Finally to display the html as well as the underlying javascript which will ultimately power the D3 visuals we invoke the following code PLEASE CLICK ON THE CLUSTERS ABOVE. csv comma separated values. This json file will come in handy later where we will call this file from the embedded javascript in the latter section. Here we have demonstrated how to embed html and javasript syntax into Ipython notebooks obtained a brief overview of the framework as well as showed how to implement a particular kind of treemap by packing circles iteratively. ConclusionIn this notebook I hope that I have managed to convey the power of the javascript visualization framework D3 Data driven documents. In this instance I will prepare a Python dictionary which will ultimately be converted into a. Therefore I am hoping that this notebook will provide a new way of visualising D3. THESE PLOTS ARE INTERACTIVE AND ZOOMABLE. To embed HTML into Kaggle notebooks I store the relevant HTML into a Python string within the Python triple quotation marks.
