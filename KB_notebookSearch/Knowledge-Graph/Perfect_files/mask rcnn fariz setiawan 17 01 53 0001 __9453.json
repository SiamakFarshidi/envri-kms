Exploratory Data Analysis Baseline 2 There is a class imbalance that will have to be dealt with. The metric checks that the pairs are sorted positive and the decoded pixel values are not duplicated. git logs refs remotes origin HEAD contains too many nested subdirectories max 6. 2019 10 17 A Keras update means the model now produces an error documented in issue 1754 https github. com max 1285 1 IWWOPIYLqqF9i_gXPmBk3g. See the section on Data Shapes for the Labels. Setting up our ML model Mask R CNN 6 Cloning and configuring Matterport s implementation of Mask RCNN. Hopefully we can balance this out at least a little with some data augmentation later. Mask R CNNMask R CNN falls under the category of meta algorithms rather than purely a neural network architecture. html reading in the image going through the 4 layers in the last dimension of our mask with shape 256 1600 4 indeces are 0 1 2 3 corresponding classes are 1 2 3 4 add the contours layer per layer the images we want to see max 2 due to limited population of squashed Distinct Defect Types 3 remove that condition if you wish to increase the sample size or add replace True to the.

Carefully illustrating ideas takes a lot more time than just writing up code so upvotes are much appreciated. png Only 7095 pictures will be of any use to us when training. Contrary to the ROIpool mechanism that was the standard this one uses bilinear interpolation https www. The pixels are numbered from top to bottom then left to right 1 is pixel 1 1 2 is pixel 2 1 etc. Read more on Matterport s official blog https engineering. Dataset class find the image in the dataframe extract function arguments create our numpy array mask we re actually doing semantic segmentation so our second return value is a bit awkward we have one layer per class rather than per instance. Instead of submitting an exhaustive list of indices for your segmentation you will submit pairs of values that contain a start position and a run length. So if we were to encode something like our example above we would have to write it as follows Exploratory Data Analysis Class ImbalancesA huge imbalance quickly becomes apparent when looking at the training set description class_imbalance https i. RPN region proposal network A lightweight neural network that scans over the FPN features to suggest ROI regions of interest ROIAlign a novel way to pass the object to the classifier an mask generator. ForewordThe main goal of this notebook is to make the ideas presented easy to understand. jpeg We are dealing with the problem of semantic segmentation predicting a pixel by pixel mask of distinct classes. you wouldn t train a pedestrian detector on a dataset of empty streets either. maskrcnn framework https miro. ly ipython notebooks color scales combining into a dictionary we want counts frequency of the labels plotly for interactive graphs display we want counts of the possible combinations of labels and their frequency plotly for interactive graphs display initialise an empty numpy array building the masks classes are 1 2 3 4 corresponding indeces are 0 1 2 3 fit the mask into the correct layer note we need to transpose the matrix to account for numpy and openCV handling width and height in reverse order https docs. The leaderboard score is the mean of the Dice coefficients for each pair in the test set. In fact it builds on the faster R CNN architecture so you even have a choice of what neural net backbone you want it to use. com semantic segmentation popular architectures dff0a75f39d0 on the topic if you want to read more. The competition format requires a space delimited list of pairs. Kernel Structure Competition Information 1 We discuss the format required from us by the competition as well as the loss function of choice and the type of encoding used. com splash of color instance segmentation with mask r cnn and tensorflow 7c761e238b46 You can also check out the original paper s authors presenting the Mask R CNN on YouTube https youtu. com matterport Mask_RCNN. be g7z4mkfRjI4 ImportingFor instructions on how to import models into a Kaggle kernel check out the following Medium article Setting Up Mask RCNN on Kaggle https medium. Adjust down if you use a smaller GPU. png To get a better understanding let s demonstrate with a quick toy example as we write the function Mean Dice CoefficientThe dataset s original format one row per imageId classId pair points at the fact that we will have to run this dice coefficient function over every layer in our mask and take the average. An overwhelming amount of the observations is for class 3. 0 d4 d73 tutorial_py_contours_begin. sample method looping over the different combinations of labels isolate from dataset and draw a sample make a subplot looping over sample current ax build the mask fetch the image and draw the contours display git clone https www. com matterport Mask_RCNN blob v2. Check out Priya Dwivedi s excellent blogpost https towardsdatascience. The submission format requires us to make the classifications for each respective class on a separate row format https i. For example 1 3 10 5 implies pixels 1 2 3 10 11 12 13 14 are to be included in the mask. The Dice coefficient can be used to compare the pixel wise agreement between a predicted segmentation and its corresponding ground truth. I resort to Simon Walker s method to get around this. com How does ROTAlign work in Mask RCNN to improve performance significantly. png Batch SizeTo leverage the parellel computation a GPU offers we will feed the images and their labels to the algorithm in batches. Formulating the Problem Semantic Segmentation 5 We define what task is expected of us. com c severstal steel defect detection overview evaluation page This competition is evaluated on the mean Dice coefficient. The formula is given by Dice X Y frac 2 X Y X Y where X is the predicted set of pixels and Y is the ground truth. Somewhat like this label shape https i. stratified split to maintain the same class balance in both sets instantiating training set instantiating validation set configuration session stuff initialiazing model we will retrain starting with the coco weights ignore UserWarnongs training at last. add_metric loss name Configuring Train Test SplitWe now have a validation set that has the same class distribution as the training set. so it will always just be 1 2 3 4. git results in Commit Error too many nested subdirectories Give the configuration a recognizable name We use a GPU with 12GB memory which can fit two images. More about this in the Data Shapes chapter. png The most important aspects of this algorithm are FPN feature pyramid network A fully convolutional neural architecture designed to extract features. com paulorzp rle functions run lenght encode decode note that we will transpose the incoming array outside of the function as I find this a clearer illustration turn a n dimensional array into a 1 dimensional series of pixels for example 1. In fact 3 4 appear together more often than 2 does on its own Data Shapes ImagesThe input shape will be an image we convert to a three dimensional array with shape 256 1600 3 for height width and the three colour channels RGB respectively. The Dice coefficient is defined to be 1 when both X and Y are empty. I try my best to be as verbose as possible but if you have remaining questions I ll happily answer them in the comments. Classifier Bounding Box Regressor. Run Length Encoding In order to reduce the submission file size our metric uses run length encoding on the pixel values. com matterport Mask_RCNN issues 1754. BaselineIf we d train on the entire dataset the risk is substantial that our model will simply learn the majority class no defect ever. Class Imbalances continued Let s see how often each class appears as well as how the class distribution is inside images. Mask Generator A convolutional network that takes the regions selected by the ROI classifier and generates soft masks for them. png Loss Function Dice CoefficientFrom the evaluation https www. Visualising the MasksLet s take a look at some examples of each class and of some of the images containing multiple classes. Or if you prefer a visual illustration dice_viz https i. We also show accuracy is the wrong metric due to the majority class no defects being the majority class. Input Output Data Shapes 3 Understanding the dimensions of the in and output that the neural network will be expecting. py https rhettinger. LabelsNaturally the masks will share the same width and height but the third dimension will be as large as there are labels 256 1600 4 with each class occupying a different layer. A First Look Visualising the Masks 4 We define some utility functions and show some instances of defects. This should allow you to get started Competition Information Prediction Output FormatFrom the competition s data https www. For each image you must segment defects of each class ClassId 1 2 3 4. we find consecutive sequences by overlaying the mask on a version of itself that is displaced by 1 pixel for that we add some padding before slicing this returns the indeces where the sliced arrays differ indexes start at 0 pixel numbers start at 1 every uneven element represents the start of a new sequence every even element is where the run comes to a stop subtract the former from the latter to get the length of the run convert the array to a string the incoming string is space delimited we do the same operation with the even and uneven elements but this time with addition pixel numbers start at 1 indexes start at 0 extract the starting and ending indeces at even and uneven intervals respectively build the mask transform the numpy array from flat to the original image shape reading in the training set keep only the images with labels squash multiple rows per image into a list count the amount of class labels per image display first ten to show new structure see https plot. png This is the benchmark to beat. 1 3 implies starting at pixel 1 and running a total of 3 pixels 1 2 3. Training 7 Currently configured to run a single epoch. It looks like combinations of two labels in a single image are reasonably frequent too. Consequently our array dimensions will be expanded to batch size 256 1600 3 and batch size 256 1600 4 respectively. com umdfirecoml setting up mask rcnn on kaggle 34b656140b5e 2019 10 10 This method currently produces an error message when committing.
