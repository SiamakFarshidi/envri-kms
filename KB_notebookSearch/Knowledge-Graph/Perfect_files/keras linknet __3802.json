The model is at least able to fit to the training data Certainly a lot of room for improvement even here but a decent start. Stride appropriately to match residual width height Should be int if network architecture is correctly configured. I ll just train for 10 epochs which takes around 10 minutes in the Kaggle kernel with the current parameters. I m by no means certain that this implementation is correct though Any assistance in verifying this would be most welcome Update This implementation is most definitely not correct due to the very large discrepancy between the results reported here and the LB results. The architecture used is the so called LinkNet https arxiv. Build and train our neural networkNext we build our model loosely based on LinkNet https arxiv. com rakhlin fast run length encoding python excellent implementation of run length encoding. I ve stolen this https www. I downsample both the training and test images to keep things light and manageable but we need to keep a record of the original sizes of the test images to upsample our predicted masks and create correct run length encodings later on. It also seems to just increase over time no matter what when you train. I ll leave it to you to improve the model architecture and parameters Make predictionsLet s make predictions both on the test set the val set and the train set as a sanity check. 277 LB Set some parameters Get train and test IDs Get and resize train images and masks Get and resize test images Check if training data looks all right Define IoU metric Build U Net model pre processing Expand channels of shortcut to match residual. IntroBasically a fork of the U Net starter where U Net is replaced with LinkNet. Seems good Create our Keras metricNow we try to define the mean average precision at different intersection over union IoU thresholds metric in Keras. post processing Fit model Predict on train val and test Threshold predictions Create list of upsampled test masks Perform a sanity check on some random training samples Perform a sanity check on some random validation samples Run length encoding stolen from https www. How about the validation data Not too shabby Definitely needs some more training and tweaking. The success of LinkNet for Carvana http slides. and then finally create our submission This scored 0. All right looks good Loss seems to be a bit erratic though. Let s iterate over the test IDs and generate run length encodings for each seperate mask identified by skimage. I recommend using checkpointing and early stopping when training your model. Next we fit the model on the training data using a validation split of 0. Remember to load the best saved model if you ve used early stopping and checkpointing. TensorFlow has a mean IoU metric but it doesn t have any native support for the mean over multiple thresholds so I tried to implement this. They also have a tendency to work quite well even on small datasets. 03718 Update Changed to ELU units added dropout. I won t do it here to make things a bit more reproducible although it s very likely that your results will be different anyway. com rakhlin fast run length encoding python Create submission DataFrame. com vladimiriglovikov kaggle deep learning to create a model for binary segmentation of car images and presentation by Vladimir Iglovikov made me think it might be worth a try for segmenting nuclei. Update Added early stopping and checkpointing and increased to 30 epochs. Have fun LB score history Version 7 0. There are definitely better ways to handle this but it works fine for now Let s see if things look all right by drawing some random images and their associated masks. 1 X 1 conv if shape is different. Get the dataLet s first import all the images and associated masks. Encode and submit our resultsNow it s time to submit our results. We use a small batch size because we have so little data. 277 You should easily be able to stabilize and improve the results just by changing a few parameters tweaking the architecture a little bit and training longer with early stopping. That was with version 2 of this notebook be aware that the results from the neural network are extremely erratic and vary greatly from run to run version 3 is significantly worse for example.
