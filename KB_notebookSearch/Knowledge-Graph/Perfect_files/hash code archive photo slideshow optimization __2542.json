We agree photos are an important part of contemporary digital and cultural life. Given a list of photos and the tags associated with each photo you are challenged to arrange the photos into a slideshow that is as interesting as possible the evaluation section explains what we mean by interesting Will your slideshow tell a good story or be a major snoozefest What s involved Hash Code is a team programming competition organized by Google for students and professionals around the world. About the Competition Note Put your heads together to solve programming challenges. Top teams will then be invited to a Google office for the Final Round.

This year s contest kicks off with an Online Qualification Round where your team can compete from wherever you d like including from one of our Hash Code hubs. 2 billion photos and videos per day The rise of digital photography creates an interesting challenge what should we do with all of these photos In this competition you will compose a slideshow out of a photo collection. Instead I tried to split all photos into several subsequences and optimized them individually. How we experience photos largely depends on the story they re arranged to tell. We tend to make good use of it too taking more photos than ever back in 2017 Google Photos announced it was backing up more than 1.

The same shots could be a monotonous series of snaps or form a narrative masterpiece. Hash Code 2020 is a wrap Congratulations to all teams hub organizers and our 2020 Champions Stay tuned for what s next 2021 planning is on and we ll announce the schedule soon. Google s coding competition Hash Code has just finished for 2020. Optimizing a photo album from Hash Code 2019I think it is not necessary to implement greedy search through all images.
