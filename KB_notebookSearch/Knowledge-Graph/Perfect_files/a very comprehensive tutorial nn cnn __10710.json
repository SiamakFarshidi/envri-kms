Final output layer A dense layer with 10 neurons for generating the output class In the simple neural network that we implemented in step 1 the loss function was LogLoss function and the optimizing Algorithm was Gradient Descent In this neural network we will use categorical_crossentropy as this is a multi class classification as the loss function and Adadelta as the optimizing function. What are Neural Networks 2. The aim of activation functions is to predict the right class of the target variable based on the input combination of variables. The core architecture of a Neural Network model is comprised of a large number of simple processing nodes called Neurons which are interconnected and organized in different layers. Some examples of complex deep neural networks are convolutional neural networks and Recurrent Neural Networks. The inputs form one layer are received and processed to generate the output which is passed to the next layer. What are Deep Neural Networks 5. Another Dropout Layer for regularization 8. 2 Implementing a Activation Function We will use sigmoid activation function because it outputs the values between 0 and 1 so its a good choice for a binary classification problem 2. Implement a Convolution Neural Network 5. In our network it contains 128 neurons but this number can be changed for further experiments. The adjustments are made such that the total error is minimized. 2 Define the Network ParametersNetwork Parameters are Batch Size Number of rows from the input data to use it one iteratation from the training purpose Num Classes Total number of possible classes in the target variable Epochs Total number of iterations for which cnn model will run. Pooling Layer Pooling layers are used to extract the most informative features from the generated convolved output. The next step is to normalize the inputs by dividing them by max pixel value ie. 4 Create the CNN Model ArchitectureIn this step create the convolutional neural network architecture with following layers 1. Output Layer To generate the final output a dense or a fully connected layer is applied with the softmax activation function. What are Neural Networks Neural networks are a type of machine learning models which are designed to operate similar to biological neurons and human nervous system.

Activation Functions The activation functions are used to apply non linear transformation on input to map it to output. Implement a Neural Network Multiclass classification 4. 7 Implement Backward PropagationIn backward propagation function the error is passed backward to previous layers and the derivatives of weights and bias are computed.

These connections repersents inputs and ouputs from a neuron. Convolutional layer In this layer a kernel or weight matrix is used to extract low level features from the images. net software theano _images numerical_padding_strides.

Deep Neural Networks Convolutional Neural Networks Deep Neural Networks are composed of complex and many number of hidden layers which tries to extract low level features from the images. 5 Implement Forward PropagationThe hidden layer and output layer will compute the activations using sigmoid activation function and will pass it in the forward direction. In this section lets implement a multi class neural network to classify the digit shown in an image from 0 to 9 3. The kernel matrix behaves like a filter in an image extracting particular information from the original image matrix. Neuron A Neuron is a single processing unit of a Neural Network which are connected to different other neurons in the network. Understanding and Implementing Neural Networks from scratchIn this kernel I have explained the intution about neural networks and how to implement neural networks from scratch in python. An individual node in a layer is connected to several other nodes in the previous and the next layer. Stride Stride is defined as the number of steps the kernel or the weight matrix takes while moving across the entire image moving N pixel at a time. The first layer of this architecture is often named as input layer which accepts the inputs the last layer is named as the output layer which produces the output and every other layer between input and output layer is named is hidden layers.

Implement a Neural Network Binary Classification Lets implement a basic neural network in python for binary classification which is used to classify if a given image is 0 or 1. com information information 07 00061 article_deploy html images information 07 00061 g001. ai course for their excellent material 1. Loss function measures the error in the final layer and cost function measures the total error of the network. The model computes the error in the predicted output in the final layer which is then used to make small adjustments the weights and bias. The weights and bias are then updated using the derivatives. The first layer only contains inputs so there are no weights and bias but the hidden layer and the output layer have a weight and bias term. While computing this activation the input is multiplied with weight and added with bias before passing it to the function. Max Pooling Layer with pooling matrix size 2 24. Dense Layer A dense layer is a fully connected layer in which every node is connected to every other node in the previous and next layers. Implement a Neural Network Multiclass Classification In the previous step I discussed about how to implement a NN for binary classification in python from scratch. png Key components of Convolutional Neural Network. 2 Train the ModelTrain a neural network model with 10 hidden layers. In our case channel 1 as we will only use single channel instead of three channels R G B. To each of its connections the neuron assigns a weight W which signifies the importance the input and adds a bias b term. Some of the popular activation functions are Relu Sigmoid and TanH. This weights and bias adjustment is done by computing the derivative of error derivative of weights bias and subtracting them from the original values. Error Computation The neural network learns by improving the values of weights and bias. It uses the algorithm called Gradient Descent in which the error is minimized and optimal values of weights and bias are obtained.

Softmax function is used to generate the probabilities for each class of the target variable. Python s libraries such as sklearn provides an excellent implementation of efficient neural networks which can be used to directly implement neural networks on a dataset. For the modelling and training purpose we can use python s library Keras. Backward Propagation Neural Network model undergoes the process called backpropagation in which the error is passed to backward layers so that those layers can also improve the associated values of weights and bias. Unlike tradational neural networks which treats an image as a one dimentional network CNNs considers the location of pixels and the neighbours for classification. Key concepts in a Neural Network A. These models are used to recognize complex patterns and relationships that exists within a labelled dataset. 6 Compute the Network Error To compute the cost one straight forward approach is to compute the absolute error among prediction and actual value. 4 Define Neural Network Parameters Neural Network parameters are weights and bias which we need to initialze with zero values. Forward Propagation Neural Network model goes through the process called forward propagation in which it passes the computed activation outputs in the forward direction. 5 Train the Model 5. Convolutional Neural Networks In Convolutional Neural Networks every image input is treated as a a matrix of pixel values which represents the amount of darkness at a given pixel in the image. During the colvolution process The weights are learnt such that the loss function is minimized. If the weight matrix moves N pixel at a time it is called stride of N.
