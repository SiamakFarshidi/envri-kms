Out of 100 people 30 people have blood type A 42 people have blood type B 8 people have blood type AB and 38 people have blood type O. Create Scatter Plot with Matplotlib Use the numpy 300 view library which has a normal distribution with an average of 170 and a deviation Generate criteria 10 and then draw a histogram for them. Differences between bar charts and histograms What is the difference between a Bar Graph and a Histogram Most importantly a histology is an evolution of the bar chart but not the same as a bar chart. Bar charts are spaced between two bars while histology has no spacing between bars. Bar charts are used to compare variables while display charts are used to show the distribution of variables. Bar charts are used to plot batch or qualitative data while histograms are used to plot quantitative data with a range of data grouped into buckets or intervals. This is because the x axis is discrete in batch bar graphs whereas in histograms they are discrete or slightly continuous. Histogram is used to show variable density at intervals. A histogram is a type of bar chart but bar charts are definitely not histological charts. Bar graph Drow simple Pie chat using matplotlib Using matplotlib styling try to make the chart more beautiful. In this case the area of the bar indicates the frequency of the variable.
