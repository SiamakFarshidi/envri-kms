A convolutional layer within a neural network should have the following attributes Convolutional kernels defined by a width and height hyper parameters. Every entry in the output volume can thus also be interpreted as an output of a neuron that looks at a small region in the input and shares parameters with neurons in the same activation map. The error or loss represents how far from the expected values our results are. Flower images obtained from http www. com androbomb mnist ale cnn where we used keras to create a CNN to apply it to the standard MNIST database we build a CNN as following We now need to create our Convolutional Neural Network model. Neurons may have a threshold such that a signal is sent only if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. A perfect model would have a log loss of 0. Loss CriteriaAs a loss criteria we use the Cross Entropy Loss log loss that measures the performance of a classification model whose output is a probability value between 0 and 1. In order to do so we need to choose the convolution and poolying layers. working folder due to the fact that Kaggle limits to 500 the number of output files I hope you enjoyed the reading This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed It is defined by the kaggle python docker image https github. org wiki Perceptron 4 https en.

We will use these to create an iterative loader for training data and a second iterative loader for test data. Local pooling combines small clusters typically 2 x 2. An artificial neuron that receives a signal then processes it and can signal neurons connected to it. html Defining the Convolutional Neural NetworkIn PyTorch you define a neural network model as a class that is derived from the nn. WeightsEach neuron in a neural network computes an output value by applying a specific function to the input values coming from the receptive field in the previous layer e. RandomResizedCrop size scale 0. This is done to prevent overfitting. Introduce the Convolutions. The final convolution in turn often involves backpropagation in order to more accurately weight the end product. The degree to which we adjust the weights is determined by the learning rate the larger the learning rate the bigger the adjustments made to the weights. The layer s parameters consist of a set of learnable filters or kernels which have a small receptive field but extend through the full depth of the input volume.

In a convolutional layer neurons receive input from only a restricted subarea of the previous layer. For example running this by clicking run or pressing Shift Enter will list all files under the input directory print os. Reset the optimizer 3. 1 https pytorch. Person images obtained from http www. Calculate the accuracy for this batch3. The activation function is commonly a REctified Linear Unit RELU layer and is subsequently followed by additional convolutions such as pooling layers fully connected layers and normalization layers referred to as hidden layers because their inputs and outputs are masked by the activation function and final convolution. The convolution operation brings a solution to the problem arising from the presence of a huge number of input data i. The vector of weights and the bias are called filters and represent particular features of the input e. predicted probabilities are 0. An overfitted model is a statistical model that contains more parameters than can be justified by the data. c d Because SLP is a linear classifier and if the cases are not linearly separable the learning process will never reach a point where all the cases are classified properly. Flatten the data in order to have a np. Backpropagation Backpropagation is an algorithm widely used in the training of feedforward neural networks for supervised learning generalizations exist for other artificial neural networks ANNs and for functions generally. It is somewhat expected since dogs and cat looks alike and we need a well deeper CNN to properly classify them. We will also use a separate set of test images to test the model at the end of each epoch so we can track the performance improvement as the training process progresses. For more on optimizers in PyTorch see 1 Notice that we have a layer that randomly drops 20 of the features to prevent overfitting. edu jkrause cars car_dataset. b Single layer and Multi layer perceptronsA single layer perceptron SLP is a feed forward network based on a threshold transfer function. com kaggle docker python For example here s several helpful packages to load in linear algebra data processing CSV file I O e. org wiki Convolutional_neural_network 3 https en. 2 To recap a CNN have1. RandomRotation degrees resample False expand False center None fill 0 4. png Fully Connected Layers Fully connected layers connect every neuron in one layer to every neuron in another layer. At this point we can add transformations to randomly modify the images as they are added to a training batch. This reduces memory footprint because a single bias and a single vector of weights are used across all receptive fields sharing that filter as opposed to each receptive field having its own bias and vector weighting. 3 1 https arxiv. A NN is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. Stacking the activation maps for all filters along the depth dimension forms the full output volume of the convolution layer. In this case we will flip images horizontally at random. html algorithms Training functionTraining consists of an iterative series of forward passes in which the training data is processed in batches by the layers in the network and the optimizer goes back and adjusts the weights. Adam can be looked at as a combination of RMSprop and Stochastic Gradient Descent with momentum. It uses the squared gradients to scale the learning rate like RMSprop and it takes advantage of momentum by using moving average of the gradient instead of gradient itself like SGD with momentum. Global pooling acts on all the neurons of the convolutional layer. org 2 https pytorch. they are important to create a feature map3. A Basics of Artificial Neural Networks Artificial neural networks ANN or NN are computing systems that are inspired by but not identical to biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. Dog images obtained from https www. Cat images obtained from https www. org wikipedia commons e e9 Max_pooling. The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. The backpropagation algorithm works by computing the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight by the chain rule iterating backwards one layer at a time from the last layer to avoid redundant calculations of intermediate terms in the chain rule this is an example of dynamic programming. Different layers may perform different transformations on their inputs. Pooling Convolutional networks may include local or global pooling layers to streamline the underlying computation. The connections are called edges. Its name is derived from adaptive moment estimation and the reason it s called that is because Adam uses estimations of first and second moments of gradient to adapt the learning rate for each weight of the neural network. DescriptionThis dataset contains 6 899 images from 8 distinct classes compiled from various sources see Acknowledgements. Drop LayersDuring the training process the convolution and pooling layers in the feature extraction section of the model generate lots of feature maps from the training images. Preliminaries II prepare and augment the dataPyTorch 1 includes functions for loading and transforming data as torchvision. org open source Python distributio to define a Convolutional Neaural Network that will be trained on the Natural Images dataset 1 by Prasun Roy. Because these data augmentation transformations are randomly applied during training the same image might be presented differently from batch to batch creating more variation in the training data and helping the model to learn features based the same objects at different orientations or scales. 32 3x3 Convolution matrix with activation relu i. As a result the network learns filters that activate when it detects some specific type of feature at some spatial position in the input. In a convolutional layer the receptive area is smaller than the entire previous layer. Convolutional layers convolve the input and pass its result to the next layer. Then after passing through a convolutional layer the image becomes abstracted to a feature map with shape number of images feature map width feature map height feature map channels. Nornalization Layerswhere 2 3 4 are hidden layers. A multi layer perceptron MLP has the same structure of a single layer perceptron with one or more hidden layers. html View Loss History Evaluate the ModelWe can see that there is a huge mislassification among dog and cats. Counteracting Overfitting Data Augmentation and Drop Layers OverfittingIn statistics overfitting is the production of an analysis that corresponds too closely or exactly to a particular set of data and may therefore fail to fit additional data or predict future observations reliably. com artificial_neural_network_bkp.

The number of input channels and output channels hyper parameter. a particular shape. Define the model as a sequential layers2. The transformations are done using torchvision. The hidden layers of a CNN typically consist of a series of convolutional layers that convolve with a multiplication or other dot product. org docs stable torchvision transforms. Adam is an adaptive learning rate method which means it computes individual learning rates for different parameters. The depth of the Convolution filter the input channels must be equal to the number channels depth of the input feature map. It is in principle the same as the traditional multi layer perceptron neural network MLP. Set the model to evaluation mode 2. in a fully connected layer the receptive field is the entire previous layer. Fully Connected Layers4. The traning function we need to define needs the following steps 1. In a fully connected layer each neuron receives input from every element of the previous layer. Having calculated the loss the training process uses a specified optimizer to calculate the derivitive of the loss function wit respect to the weights and biases used in the network layers and determine how best to adjust them to reduce the loss. In addition pooling may compute a max or an average. The function that is applied to the input values is determined by a vector of weights and a bias typically real numbers. Inside each batches we have to 1. Cross entropy loss increases as the predicted probability diverges from the actual label. For example if our CNN have three possibile classes C_1 C_2 C_3 and e. org wiki Overfitting 7 https machinelearningmastery. compute the loss 5. Introduce the Poolings MaxPooling is used to reduce dimensionality. The input area of a neuron is called its receptive field. If the validation error increases positive slope while the training error steadily decreases negative slope then a situation of overfitting may have occurred. Signals travel from the first layer the input layer to the last layer the output layer possibly after traversing the layers multiple times. com images Perceptron_bkp_1. the number of pixels as it reduces the number of free parameters allowing the network to be deeper with fewer parameters. SLP is the simplest type of artificial neural networks and can only classify linearly separable cases with a binary target 1 0. The convolutional layer is the core building block of a CNN. Fruit images obtained from https www. 012 when the actual observation label is 1 would be bad and result in a high loss value. Push the data forward through the layers of the model 4. As in the kernel MNIST_ale_CNN https www. Acknowledgements1. Neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds. The backpropagation algorithm consists of two phases the forward phase where the activations are propagated from the input to the output layer and the backward phase where the error between the observed actual and the requested nominal value in the output layer is propagated backwards in order to modify the weights and bias values. 6 b https upload.

During the forward pass each filter is convolved across the width and height of the input volume computing the dot product between the entries of the filter and the input and producing a 2 dimensional activation map of that filter. The best predictive and fitted model would be where the validation error has its global minimum. Process the images in batches we will iterate over images in batches. join dirname filename Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output. svg In the image above training error is shown in blue validation error in red both as a function of the number of training epochs. A 2x2 MaxPoolingAs a optimaizer we decided to use the ADAM ADAptive Moment estimation optimization algorithm that is an extension to stochastic gradient descent that has recently seen broader adoption for deep learning applications in computer vision and natural language processing. Such systems learn to perform tasks by considering examples generally without being programmed with task specific rules. The essence of overfitting is to have unknowingly extracted some of the residual variation i. We will this define a resizing function resize_image that resize consistently the image to a shape passed to the function by the user by default is 128 128 as done in my notebook on image pre treatment https www. Convolutional Neural Network CNN A convolutional neural network CNN consists of an input and an output layer as well as multiple hidden layers. We will apply 12 filters in the first convolutional layer A second convolutional layer takes 12 input channels and generates 24 outputs We in the end apply max pooling with a kernel size of 2 A drop layer deletes 20 of the features to help prevent overfitting Our 128x128 image tensors will be pooled twice with a kernel size of 2. Data AugmentationOne way to mitigate the overfitting problem is to perform data augmentation by making random transformations of the training images for example by flipping rotating or cropping the images.
