Happy Kaggling plotting linear algebra accessing directory structure data processing CSV file I O e. This will create a copy of the code and environment for you to edit. csvLet s take a quick look at what the data looks like Distribution graphs histogram bar graph of sampled columns Let s check 3rd file. csv has 1122 rows in reality but we are only loading previewing the first 1000 rows specify None if want to read whole file camelyon16_train_tumor_004. input camelyon16_train_tumor_003. Click on the Code button in the published kernel to reveal the hidden code. input camelyon16_train_tumor_004. IntroductionGreetings from the Kaggle bot This is an automatically generated kernel with starter code demonstrating how to read in the data and begin exploring. csvLet s take a quick look at what the data looks like Distribution graphs histogram bar graph of sampled columns ConclusionThis concludes your starter analysis To go forward from here click the blue Fork Notebook button at the top of this kernel. input camelyon16_train_tumor_002. If you re inspired to dig deeper click the blue Fork Notebook button at the top of this kernel to begin editing. Depending on the data not all plots will be made. read_csv Distribution graphs histogram bar graph of column data For displaying purposes pick columns that have between 1 and 50 unique values Correlation matrix drop columns with NaN keep columns where there are more than 1 unique values Scatter and density plots keep only numerical columns Remove rows and columns that would lead to df being singular keep columns where there are more than 1 unique values reduce the number of columns for matrix inversion of kernel density plots specify None if want to read whole file specify None if want to read whole file camelyon16_train_tumor_003. Hey I m just a simple kerneling bot not a Kaggle Competitions Grandmaster There are 40 csv files in the current version of the dataset The next hidden code cells define functions for plotting data. Delete modify and add code as you please. Exploratory AnalysisTo begin this exploratory analysis first import libraries and define functions for plotting the data using matplotlib. csv has 2377 rows in reality but we are only loading previewing the first 1000 rows. Let s check 1st file. csvLet s take a quick look at what the data looks like Distribution graphs histogram bar graph of sampled columns Let s check 2nd file.
