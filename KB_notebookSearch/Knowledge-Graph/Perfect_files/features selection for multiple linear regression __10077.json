The M2 model can be described by this equation Sales 0. Notice that when levels of either TV or radio are low then the true sales are lower than predicted by the linear model. 9 0 Its normal is 0. This suggests that only TV and radio are related to sales. It is based on the Advertising Dataset taken from the masterpiece book Introduction to Statistical Learning by Hastie Witten Tibhirani James. Instead we can use other approaches. The predictors explain almost 90 of the variance in sales. The figure above suggests that such an effect may be present in the advertising data. You can find more notebook examples around linear regression on my GitHub. In this case F is far larger than 1 at least one of the three advertising media must be related to sales. The distance from any point in a collection of data to the mean of the data is the deviation. But when advertising is split between the two media then the model tends to underestimate sales. Plotting the modelThe M2 model has two variables therefore can be plotted as a plane in a 3D chart. we need first to calculate the Residual Sum of Squares RSS mean of sales we have three predictors TV Radio and Newspaper we have 200 data points input samples a plane is a x b y c z d 0 a b c is the normal. We can then select the best model out of all of the models that we have considered for example the model with the smallest RSS and the biggest R squared other used metrics are the Akaike Information Criterion AIC Bayesian Information Criterion BIC and the adjusted R2. Now we have a best model M1 which contains TV advertising. 05 1 and a point on the plane is 2. However this simple model may be incorrect. In the multiple linear regression above the p values for TV and radio are low but the p value for newspaper is not. These provide information about whether each individual predictor is related to the response high t statistic or low p value. How strong is the relationship Once we have rejected the null hypothesis in favour of the alternative hypothesis it is natural to want to quantify the extent to which the model fits the data. The three classical ways are the forward selection start with no features and add one after the other until a threshold is reached the backward selection start with all features and remove one by one and the mixed selection a combination of the two. In this situation given a fixed budget of 100K spending half on radio and half on TV may increase sales more than allocating the entire amount to either TV or to radio. The most common hypothesis test involves testing the null hypothesis of H0 There is no relationship between the media and sales versus the alternative hypothesis Ha There is some relationship between the media and sales. Is at least one of the features useful in predicting Sales We use a hypothesis test to answer this question. In marketing this is known as a synergy effect. 1 1 https github. It seems likely that if any one of the p values for the individual features is very small then at least one of the predictors is related to the response. 68 units while the mean value for the response is 14 022 indicating a percentage error of roughly 12. The quality of a linear regression fit is typically assessed using two related quantities the residual standard error RSE and the R squared statistic the square of the correlation of the response and the variable when close to 1 means high correlation. The F statistic does not suffer from this problem because it adjusts for the number of predictors. Well the model with TV AND Radio greatly decreased RSS and increased R2 so that will be our M2 model. 7 for the model M2 that predicts sales using TV and radio without an interaction term. 7 69 of the variability in sales that remains after fitting the additive model has been explained by the interaction term. We then add to this M1 model the variable that results in the lowest RSS for the new two variable model. Another thing to note is that the summary table provides also a t statistic and a p value for each single feature. For example running this by clicking run or pressing Shift Enter will list the files in the input directory Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output. In contrast the coefficient for newspaper represents the average effect negligible of increasing newspaper spending by 1000 dollars while holding TV and radio fixed. Now we have only three variables here. M3 is slightly better than M2 but remember that R2 always increases when adding new variables so we call the approach completed and decide that the M2 model with TV and Radio is the good compromise. This implies that a model that uses TV and radio expenditures to predict sales is substantially better than one that uses only TV advertising. com kaggle docker python For example here s several helpful packages to load in linear algebra data processing CSV file I O e. 26 0 0 Let s plot the actual values as red points and the model predictions as a cyan plane Is there synergy among the advertising media Adding radio to the model leads to a substantial improvement in R squared. Ideally we could perform the variable selection by trying out a lot of different models each containing a different subset of the features. Therefore an adjusted R squared is provided which is R squared adjusted by the number of predictors. The p value for the interaction term TV radio is extremely low indicating that there is strong evidence for Ha \u03b23 not zero. Imaging being the Marketing responsible and you need to prepare a new advertising plan for next year. The task of determining which predictors are associated with the response in order to fit a single model involving only those predictors is referred to as variable feature selection. Which media contribute to sales To answer this question we could examine the p values associated with each predictor s t statistic. read_csv Input data files are available in the. We can decide to stop at M2 or use an M3 model with all three variables. On the other hand if Ha is true then we expect F to be greater than 1. All of them are visible in the summary model. com Mashimo datascience This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed It is defined by the kaggle python docker image https github. However this logic is flawed especially when you have many predictors statistically about 5 of the p values will be below 0. The F statistic is the ratio between TSS RSS p and RSS n p 1 When there is no relationship between the response and predictors one would expect the F statistic to take on a value close to 1. the line that minimises the squared differences between the actual Sales and the line itself. This approach is continued until some stopping rule is satisfied. You may be interested in answering questions such as which media contribute to sales Do all three media TV radio and newspaper contribute to sales or do just one or two of the media contribute Import Advertising data Is there a relationship between sales and advertising First of all we fit a regression line using the Ordinary Least Square algorithm i. Next year no budget for newspaper advertising and that amount will be used for TV and Radio instead. In other words it is clear that the true relationship is not additive. Mathematically this corresponds to testing H0 \u03b21 \u03b22 \u03b23 \u03b24 0 versus Ha at least one \u03b2i is non zero. Following is an example of features selection for the linear regression. The lowest RSS and the highest R2 are for the TV medium. Summarystatsmodels has a handy function that provides the above metrics in one single table One thing to note is that R squared will always increase when more variables are added to the model even if those variables are only weakly associated with the response. For three predictors it would still be manageable only 8 models to fit and evaluate but as p increases the number of models grows exponentially. 9 which I can write as 0. But as just seen if p is large then we are likely to make some false discoveries. 8 compared to only 89. Thus we have to calculate d and we re set dot product create x y calculate corresponding z. Recall that we already fitted and evaluated a model with all features just at the beginning. The multiple linear regression model takes the form Sales \u03b20 \u03b21 TV \u03b22 Radio \u03b23 Newspaper \u03b5 where Beta are the regression coefficients we want to find and epsilon is the error that we want to minimise. We interpret these results as follows for a given amount of TV and newspaper advertising spending an additional 1000 dollars on radio advertising leads to an increase in sales by approximately 189 units. Suppose that spending money on radio advertising actually increases the effectiveness of TV advertising so that the slope term for TV should increase as radio increases. The results strongly suggest that the model that includes the interaction term is superior to the model that contains only main effects. The dataset contains statistics about the sales of a product in 200 different markets together with advertising budgets in each of these markets for different media channels TV radio and newspaper. A linear model that uses radio TV and an interaction between the two to predict sales takes the form sales \u03b20 \u03b21 TV \u03b22 radio \u03b23 radio TV \u03b5We can interpret \u03b23 as the increase in the effectiveness of TV advertising for a one unit increase in radio advertising or vice versa. We try here the forward selection. Adding the newspaper could possibly overfits on new test data. Unfortunately there are a total of 2 p models that contain subsets of p variables. Second the R2 statistic records the percentage of variability in the response that is explained by the predictors. The R squared for this model is 96. 05 by chance this is the effect infamously leveraged by the so called p hacking. Forward selectionWe start with a null model no features we then fit three p 3 simple linear regressions and add to the null model the variable that results in the lowest RSS. This hypothesis test is performed by computing the F statistic Now we need the Total Sum of Squares TSS the total variance in the response Y and can be thought of as the amount of variability inherent in the response before the regression is performed.
