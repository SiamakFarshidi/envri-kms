Magnitudes allwise_w3 and allwise_w4 also seem to have their own systematics based on cross database analysis. KIC 8462852KIC 8462852 is an enigmatic star Boyajian et al. In addition to distance we re including distance in the galactic plane and a couple gaussian transformations of the distance from the galactic plane which seem to help the model resolve variations in extinction due to proximity to galactic latitude 0. A position based magnitude bias correction is applied to the residuals of the blend. DataData was obtained from the Gaia Archive https gea. BlendThe blend only has two models this time. com solorzano 257k gaia dr2 stars from the Northern and Southern hemispheres with photometry from a number of other databases. Columns found in the data frame are Removal of duplicates and region with artifactThere are rows with duplicate source_id values multiple Tycho2 matches and some apparent line of sight artifacts as explained in Removal of Gaia DR2 Stars With Apparent Systematic https www. Model results are made available in the output tab. Train Test splitWe ll use 90 of the data work_data for cross validation and hype parameter optimization. Those kinds of artifacts seem to be largely removed. Follow ups Multi Stellar SETI Candidate Selection Part 1 https www. com Microsoft LightGBM this time. Note that once again we re using the trim_fraction parameter so that extreme outliers don t distort neighbor results. OverviewA model of stellar magnitude was presented in Dysonian SETI With Machine Learning https www. A sample of ordinary stars is shown in gray. Hyperparameters for gaussian transformations of distance from plane. It has a standard deviation of 1. OutputModel results and other dataset columns are made available in the output tab of this kernel. Note that in addition to position features we re including a parallax_error derived feature. Anomaly metricThe anomaly metric is defined as the locally standardized model residual. The standard deviation of anomaly should be 1. We ve found it s better to separate them into groups first. It actually is consistent with what we see in the work_data frame now By concatenating work_data and test_data we end up with results for the whole dataset minus giants. Its neighbors will be unusually dim according to the model. Look for the black dot. Multiple runs of k fold cross validation are averaged out. Next we define a function that extracts the features used to train regression models. Its standard deviation is roughly 1. Some changes and improvements are introduced in this kernel We re using a dataset of 257K Gaia DR2 stars https www. Note about AllWISE artifactIn an earlier version of the kernel we had removed the region around an apparent line of sight artifact. At most we use these many records in each pass Neural NetworkThis is a little surprising. We ll just remove all of the rows that are potentially problematic. More importantly there s an issue that can be corrected here. The remaining 10 test_data will be set aside for final confirmation and validation. 3 PPMXL 2MASS AllWISE and Tycho2. Some outliers and a sample of ordinary stars are shown in 3D scatter charts. So we ll take advantage of the trim_fraction parameter of the cross validation modeling transform to ignore outliers when training this position based correction. com solorzano multi stellar seti candidate selection part 1 Multi Stellar SETI Candidate Selection Part 2 https www. _Dysonian Approach to SETI A Fruitful Middle Ground _ Journal of the British Interplanetary Society vol. 64Y Z 0Upon further analysis we narrowed the issue down to the allwise_w1 magnitude. It s an ordinary star according to the model. What we re looking for here is that there a no beams of candidates aligned with Earth which would indicate there are possible line of sight artifacts. AcknowledgmentsThis work has made use of data from the European Space Agency ESA mission Gaia https www. Squared residual modelingWe corrected for position based bias but error also seems to depend on position in the sky. Helper functions used in modelingSome boilerplate The following function is similar to the one we used to train the original model except this one averages out multiple runs of k fold cross validation. KIC 8462852 Where s the Flux _ arXiv 1509. It s usually possible to squeeze a bit more performance by modeling residuals. A concrete example is Gaia DR2 1596779097312755328 an extremely bright outlier. The separation function we will use to remove giants is visually derived. A random forest works well for this because of the nature of the feature space. The anomaly column is the key result. LightGBM modelWe re usng LightGBM https github. Note that in addition to calling populate_mag_columns we ve added some differences between Gaia magnitudes and specific magnitudes from other databases. The following function gets the within group differences. com solorzano multi stellar seti candidate selection part 3 Updates 9 1 2018 Removed region with apparent Gaia magnitude artifacts. The distance from plane transformations improve meta model performance considerably. We re also adding KIC 8462852 to the 3D scatter charts. These results are not that bad if you consider we re modeling noise. Anomalously dim stars would cluster near a plane given by 0. It seems reasonable to do that even though it s not clear that it helps a whole lot. The anomaly metric is the key result. Funding for the DPAC has been provided by national institutions in particular the institutions participating in the Gaia Multilateral Agreement. Giant removalIn prior kernels we found that the model struggles with giant stars. int gaia processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium DPAC https www. com solorzano multi stellar seti candidate selection part 2 Multi Stellar SETI Candidate Selection Part 3 https www. ReferencesBoyajian et al. 08351 Get rid of big frame Due to Pandas versioning issue plt. The concept is similar to that of a trimmed average. The anomalously bright star control group is shown in red below. Regression training is done over a sample of available data. _SETI with Gaia The observational signatures of nearly complete Dyson spheres_. Extra columnsWe ll add some columns for convenience and informational purposes. Adjustment for position based distortionsThe base model already included position features as they greatly improve model performance. mean squared error of magnitude residuals. We re only using allwise_w2 at this point. Final transformation and validationThe test data we set aside has the following approximate RMSE This is lower than we saw previously but that s because we removed giants. We ll include our sun in visualizations. com solorzano dysonian seti with machine learning. We ve found these additional differences improve model performance. Positive anomaly values indicate a star is dimmer than expected. Its model results follow. X points to the galactic center and Z is perpendicular to the galactic plane. Anomalous and control group selectionFor visualization purposes let s get a list of dim outliers at a 3 sigma cut off. This means there s likely a complex interaction between position and spectrophotometric features. It s fast and accurate. It s a sensitive model. We could presumably lose some information by including position but it greatly improves model performance. We ll also get some bright and ordinary controls. We do want the model to learn about the spectrophotometric characteristics of giant stars but we ll remove them from further consideration at this stage of the analysis. The model_response column will contain the response of the blend plus the response of the residual model we just trained. It should be noted that excluding position features from the base model and applying a correction on the residuals wouldn t work this well. Anomalously dim stars are shown in green. Since giants have been removed these brighter than expected stars are largely in the main sequence. It also has a optional trim_fraction parameter that allows outliers of training subsets to be removed. 0 absent extreme outliers. Because the model includes position features a extreme outlier can affect its neighbors. Space distribution of star groupsThe following function calculates rectangular x y z coordinates for each star. com solorzano 257k gaia dr2 stars. Note that we re including color_index as a feature here in case there are color based dependencies to the distortions. Model featuresPrimarily we want to use differences between magnitude observations made with different photometric filters. Giants are removed post training and RMSE is subsequently 0. Look for the blue dot. It seems to help slightly. Additionally AllWISE magnitudes other than allwise_w2 are no longer used because of line of sight artifacts. The regression label will be defined by the following variable. int archive using its ADQL query tool and made available in a Kaggle dataset https www. We re basically using a random forest to estimate the regional variance i. A star s position in the sky is also a feature. hist can be very slow. int web gaia dpac consortium. We will use it in residual and squared error modeling. In addition to Gaia DR2 parallax and photometry the dataset includes magnitude observations from GSC 2. It s unusual to find that a neural network does better than a GBM with a relatively small number of features. extra info columns individual models the blend position based residual correction removal of giants add the residual column regional residual variance anomaly metric Discard big array. 156 165Zackrisson et al.
