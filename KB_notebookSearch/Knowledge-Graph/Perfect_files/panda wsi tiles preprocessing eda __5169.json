Like layers in Photoshop you can create a tile grid on top of a slide that reveal only usefull informations like this proposition from Deron Eriksson Fei Hu https developer. But after testing some of this solutions I was disappointed by the time that it need several hours. This notebook only concern image preprocessing before any model training. So I mention everytime is possibleYou can follow my details reflexion in part I Explorating code or jump and directly to the final code in part II Final code. Note that with a multiprocess split we could drastically reduce the operations times. Grid tile scoreKnowing how to extract a specific tile from a slide we want now to score each tile for keeping only relevant information. Let see how we can code this idea. csv index_col 0 tiles_labels_df. to proceed all the given dataset. read_csv kaggle input panda tiles labels_EDA PANDA_tiles_labels_EDA. One of the first step will be to drop all these unsignifiant pixels by cropping our slide. Tiles generationWe can extract tile informations slide region coordinate for only usefull tiles not empty Improve tiles generationThat seem a good way to decompose each in tiles that could be then send to any model. With this grid we can select and display at different level any specific slide zone x y We can see here that a tile size of 128x128px on scale 4 can be a good trade off between size and quality details. Make any operation read extract.

Final codeBellow here is our final code to generate a tile label dataframe on all 5060 Radboud slides. As we work with Radboud slides we will find details mask evaluated pixel by pixel. It is equivalent of a grid of 32x32 tile on the low level 3. Save once any export file 3. We can apply the same previous process of white pixel counting on each tile. com articles an automatic method to identify tissues from big whole slide images pt4. In the ideal on each file of the dataset we may follow these steps 1. Like for white pixels we can use the corresponding masks to add 6 scores proportion column. I propose here an approach to generate tile information without having to save them locally but just by keeping any relevant information like coordinates and details Gleason score from Radboud mask. com iafoss panda 16x128x128 tiles and PAB97 https www. Secondly in the specific case of prostate biopsy there are at least 80 unusefull informations in the slide so you spend 80 of the time waiting for nothing relevant Thirdly saving any part of the original files is data redundant. head Display a mask with tiles scoring Open Read lowest definition image Get number of tiles in x and y direction tiles with score dimension Browse each tiles Tile size depend on scale factor Localization from the level 0 max scale interval to get coordinate Create an empty score list Count by pixel score present on the first color channel Create a score dict Update score list Close Generate a heatmap Get negative zone score Mask threshold OBSERVATION 2s to score tiles from 1 slide Generate score tiles from files and masks Open files Read lowest definition image Get number of gridsquares in x and y direction Browse each tiles Tile size depend on scale factor Localization from the level 0 max scale interval to get coordinate Read biopsy file Convert to black and white Keep only not blank tiles Read mask file Count by pixel score present on the first color channel Create a score dict Create an empty score list from 0 to 5 Update score list Add tile Close Testing generate_tiles_labels Free memory Extract label tiles for all slides with multiprocessing Processes available Image per process split start tasks pooling OBSERVATION 1 2s to extract and score tiles from 1 slides OBSERVATION 2 6m to extract and score tiles from 964 slides on 4 process Use this to interrupt the multiprocess pool and free your CPUs after a Cancel run command Export tiles for further usage Import tiles with labels dataframe for checkpoint purpose Free memory tiles_labels_df pd. Feel free to copy reuse and fork anything that you find usefull Author Do Huynh Date June 1st 2020 I. I will particularly focus on runtime issue because it can be very frustating to wait too long between each iteration. Open once a file 2. com c prostate cancer grade assessment Prostate Cancer Grade Assessment. Then you can load this tiles selection to train your model. In the same conditions it will take more than 30 min. Grid tile selectionAs we have seen previously opening and saving an important number of big files is not a great idea. First if you want to benefit to the best definition the slide is to huge for the local memory and you will fastly face with not enough ressource. But can we add more usefull information during this generation process in order to save time for further exploration It is time to retrieve information from mask. Not so long in absolute time but for the purpose to iterate fastly on the dataset we should avoid any unusefull I O operation on the filesystem. A stand alone script final version is also available PanDa Final script https www. So you can have a break take a coffe or play with your children You may also run reuse this separate script https www. Explorating code Observations about I O times As usually read write operations on the filesystem tend to increase a lot the global operations times. read_csv kaggle input panda tiles EDA PANDA_tiles_EDA. csv index_col 0 tiles_df. Moreover the tiles are often extract from the lower definition and if you want to keep more information or a different tile size you must put a new coin in the time machine Alternatively my assumption is that a reading on the fly of the slide is more efficient without local saving step. com huynhdoo panda wsi tiles preprocessing script. PanDa tiles preprocessingThis notebook is about the PanDa Dataset 2020 https www. com rftexas better image tiles removing white spaces kernels. But how can we deal with this so big images to send it to any learning algorithm in an efficient way Some Kaggle players have propose a tile extraction that keep the most relevant part of the image with most appearing tissues and less blank and save them to disk see Iafoss https www. It can be run alone without all previous codes. Close once a file Observation about unsignifiant pixelAs we can observe there are a lot of unsignifiant regions on each slide with many empty white pixel from 80 to 98 of a slide.
