Stages arrange photos post processing Arrange photos Post processingOur submission consists of separate subsequences and we never thought about how these subsequences fit together. com huikang 441k in 11 mins for more details start from photo with most tags so we can easily match photos with more tags with photos with less tags we do not need to consider between pairs we have found an optimal match early stopping in the search for a paired photo penalise if the total number of tags is odd to encourage the total number of tags around 22. Create submission define some models and functions slide size distribution score number of slides loss subsequence post processing trying to reduce number of subsequences all subsequences must remain perfect Match vertical photos Please see https www. Instead I tried to split all photos into several subsequences and optimized them individually. Optimizing a photo album from Hash Code 2019I think it is not necessary to implement greedy search through all images.
