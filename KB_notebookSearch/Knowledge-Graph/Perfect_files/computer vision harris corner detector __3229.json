The corresponding eigenvalues give us the actual value amount of these increases. When R is large which happens when \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 are large and \u03bb1 \u03bb2 the region is a corner. Find all pixels that exceed a certain threshold and are the local maxima within a certain window to prevent redundant dupes of features For each pixel that meets the criteria in 5 compute a feature descriptor. jpg \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 are the eigenvalues of M. More formally we take the sum squared difference SSD of the pixel values before and after the shift and identifying pixel windows where the SSD is large for shifts in all 8 directions. So the values of these eigenvalues decide whether a region is a corner edge or flat. jpg By solving for the eigenvectors of M we can obtain the directions for both the largest and smallest increases in SSD. When R is small which happens when \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 are small the region is flat. Call this its Harris value. Corner Corner can be interpreted as the junction of two edges where an edge is a sudden change in image brightness Corner are important features in image generally termed as interest point https miro. jpg We have to maximize this function E u v for corner detection. When R \u03bb2 or vice versa the region is an edge. The features in the image are all pixels that have large values of E u v as defined by some threshold. com max 504 0 FIdvkHWmkOZCpVGX. com max 713 0 PPJxP5y_k4GCWLBM. jpg Now we rename the summed matrix and put it to be M https miro. com max 605 0 6i w 2n7p5Gxs6cv. jpg In the above figure if we take flat region no gradient changes observed in any direction similary along the edge direction So both flat region edge region are bad per patch matching While in corner region move window in all direction observe significant changes in gradient Corner detection The idea is to consider a small window around each pixel P in image We want to identify all such pixel windows that are unique. Let us define the change function E u v as the sum of all the sum squared differences SSD where u v are the x y coordinates of every pixel in our 3 x 3 window and I is the intensity value of the pixel. Uniqueness can be measured by shifting each window by a small amount in a given direction and measuring the amount of change that occurs in the pixel values. Applying Taylor Expansion to the above equation and using some mathematical steps we get the final equation as https miro. com max 350 0 TcmYywgDfz3lkN8v. com max 359 0 piogPZ 2vaYuDQiG. com max 648 0 YORAyROLRUYkqxlq.
