At a high level the entire corpora of text is segmented using a set of delimiter tokens. One way is to use a linguistic heavy approach called chunking to detect phrases. Phrases From Summarised text Implementation of Bert and Elmo Method ELMO embeddings with KERAS. read_csv Input data files are available in the read only. This can be special characters stop words and other terms that can indicate phrase boundary. The difference you would need to add a layer of intelligence in processing your text data to pre discover phrases. com kaggle docker python For example here s several helpful packages to load linear algebra data processing CSV file I O e. Now trying to Summarize the text by using Word2vec to find semantically co related terms. Instead of using a fixed embedding for each word ELMo looks at the entire sentence before assigning each word in it an embedding. It uses a bi directional LSTM trained on a specific task to be able to create those embeddings. org wiki HIV These results are not good as none of the term looks semantically co related. or we need phrase not words. Training a Word2Vec model with phrases is very similar to training a Word2Vec model with single words. org wiki Sexually_transmitted_infection https en. input directory For example running this by clicking run or pressing Shift Enter will list all files under the input directory You can write up to 5GB to the current directory kaggle working that gets preserved as output when you create a version using Save Run All You can also write temporary files to kaggle temp but they won t be saved outside of the current session generate approximate phrases with punctation examine each word to determine if it is a phrase boundary marker or part of a phrase or lone ranger phrase boundary encountered so put a hard indicator keep adding words to list until a phrase boundary is detected get a list of candidate phrases without boundary demarcation return average of ELMo features Load pretrained model tokenizer. org wiki Diabetes https en.
