Nuclear specklesNuclear speckles can be seen as irregular and mottled spots inside the nucleoplasm. More examples 5. Intermediate filaments may extend through the whole cytosol or be concentrated in an area close to the nucleus. The ER can be identified with the help of the staining in the yellow ER channel. More examples 15. Actin filaments Actin filaments can be seen as long and rather straight bundles of filaments or as branched networks of thinner filaments. More examples 13. Both are at the outer edge of the cell. This means that the cells have no green staining negative or have staining but no pattern can be deciphered from the staining unspecific. Single Cell Patterns Train Set AnalysisThe objective of this notebook is to compare the theory single cell patterns as described in the original host notebook with reality examples coming from the train set. More examples 4. PNG Please upvote if you found this helpful you will make my day. Vesicles Peroxisomes Endosomes Lysosomes Lipid droplets Cytoplasmic bodies 18. The number and size of nucleoli varies between cell types. They vary in shape size and numbers depending on the type of bodies as well as cell type but are usually more rounded compared to nuclear speckles. More examples 1. More examples 16. Plasma membraneThis class includes plasma membrane and cell junctions. More examples 2. More examples 3. I hope this insights will help with the modelling The train set examples were generated by segmenting train images with HPA Cell Segmentator and saving the RGB channels to jpg images. It has a folded ribbon like appearance but the shape and size can vary between cell types and in response to cellular various processes. They can appear similar to microtubules but do not match well with the staining in the red microtubule channel. More examples 14. More examples 11. More examples 8. Plasma membrane sometimes appears as a more or less distinct edge around the cell occasionally with characteristic protrusions or ruffles. Endoplasmic reticulumThe endoplasmic reticulum ER is recognized by a network like staining in the cytosol which is usually stronger close to the nucleus and weaker close to the edges of the cell. Cell junctions can be observed at contact sites between neighboring cells. Nice people that enjoy this notebook also press the upvote button 0. Golgi apparatusThe Golgi apparatus is a rather large organelle that is located next to the nucleus close to the centrosome from which the microtubules in the red channel originate. When a cell is dividing the two centrosomes move to opposite ends of the cell and form the poles of the mitotic spindle. These may contain a lot of noise as individuall cells may not necessarily reflect the image level labels. It is not perfectly smooth and sometimes it is also possible to see the folds of the membrane as small circles or dots inside the nucleus. Nuclear bodiesNuclear bodies are visible as distinct spots in the nucleoplasm. More examples 6. It is almost always possible to detect the center from which they all originate the centrosome. Mitotic spindleThe mitotic spindle can be seen as an intricate structure of microtubules radiating from each of the centrosomes at opposite ends of a dividing cell mitosis. The size and exact shape of the mitotic spindle changes during mitotic progression clearly reflecting the different stages of mitosis. NucleoplasmThe nucleus is found in the center of cell and can be identified with the help of the signal in the blue nucleus channel. CentrosomeThis class includes centrosomes and centriolar satellites. They can be seen as a more or less distinct staining of a small area at the origin of the microtubules close to the nucleus. They can be round or more elongated. NucleoliNucleoli can be seen as slightly elongated circular areas in the nucleoplasm which usually display a much weaker staining in the blue DAPI channel. More examples 12. AggresomeAn aggresome can be seen as a dense cytoplasmic inclusion which is usually found close to the nucleus in a region where the microtubule network is disrupted. CytosolThe cytosol extends from the plasma membrane to the nuclear membrane. They are highly dynamic varying in numbers and size in response to environmental and cellular cues. More examples 9. More examples 7. PNG attachment Capture. Nucleoli fibrillar centerNucleoli fibrillary center can appear as a spotty cluster or as a single bigger spot in the nucleolus depending on the cell type. A staining of the nucleoplasm may include the whole nucleus or of the nucleus without the regions known as nucleoli Class 2. And yes as you might have guessed this overlaps the staining in the red channel. More examples 17. Vesicles and punctate cytosolic patternsThis class includes small circular compartments in the cytosol Vesicles Peroxisomes lipid metabolism Endosomes sorting compartments Lysosomes degradation of molecules or eating up dead molecules Lipid droplets fat storage Cytoplasmic bodies distinct granules in the cytosol. At this stage the chromatin of the cell is condensed as visible by intense DAPI staining. More examples 10. In some cell lines the staining can be uniform across the entire cell. NegativeThis class include negative stainings and unspecific patterns. They are usually located close to the edges of the cells. MicrotubulesMicrotubules are seen as thin strands that stretch throughout the whole cell. Nuclear membraneThe nuclear membrane appears as a thin circle around the nucleus. Intermediate filamentsIntermediate filaments often exhibit a slightly tangled structure with strands crossing every so often. It can appear smooth or granular and the staining is often stronger close to the nucleus.
