Annotators did have access to the COVID status for each patient but were asked to adhere to the grading system above irrespective of the status. As such some patients who were COVID negative still had chest radiographs with typical appearances. As this is a kernels only competition we shsould plan accordingly i. The challenge uses the standard PASCAL VOC 2010 mean Average Precision mAP at IoU 0. Review of chest radiograph findings of COVID 19 pneumonia and suggested reporting language. png DATASET INFORMATIONThe train dataset comprises 6 334 chest scans in DICOM format which were de identified to protect patient privacy. This is an object detection and classification problem. The study ID here relates directly to the study level predictions the image ID is the ID used for image level predictionsThe test dataset is of roughly the same scale as the training dataset. Note that the linked document describes VOC 2012 which differs in some minor ways e. 2020 Nov 14 35 6 354 60. For each test image you will be predicting a bounding box and class for all findings.

The goal in this challenge is to determine the appropriate category for each radiograph as well as localize the lung opacities with a bounding box prediction. The images are in DICOM format which means they contain additional data that might be useful for visualizing and classifying. Similarly some patients who were COVID positive had atypical appearances or were negative for pneumonia no lung opacities because the grading system is based off the chest radiographic findings alone. 1. def prep_tf_dataset_w_target img_path bbox target img_shape invert True rotate_trick True repair_images False img_tensor tf_load_image img_path bbox img_size img_shape 2 tile_to_3_channel img_shape 1 3 invert invert rotate_trick rotate_trick repair_images repair_images return img_tensor target def prep_tf_dataset_wo_target img_path bbox img_shape invert True rotate_trick True repair_images False img_tensor tf_load_image img_path bbox img_size img_shape 2 tile_to_3_channel img_shape 1 3 invert invert rotate_trick rotate_trick repair_images repair_images img_id tf.

Note that all images are stored in paths with the form study series image. Typical Appearance Multifocal bilateral peripheral opacities with rounded morphology lower lung predominant distribution2. In cases of multiple adjacent opacities we opted for one large bounding box rather than multiple adjacent smaller boxes to improve consistency in the labeling. The P R curve and AP calculations remain the same. Negative for Pneumonia No lung opacitiesBounding boxes were placed on lung opacities whether typical or indeterminate. In this competition we are making predictions at both a study multi image and image level. aspx Per the grading schema chest radiographs are classified into one of four categories which are mutually exclusive 1. 1 THE DATA BACKGROUND INFORMATIONIn this competition we are identifying and localizing COVID 19 abnormalities on chest radiographs. If you predict that there are no findings you should create a prediction of none 1 0 0 1 1 none is the class ID for no finding and this provides a one pixel bounding box with a confidence of 1.
