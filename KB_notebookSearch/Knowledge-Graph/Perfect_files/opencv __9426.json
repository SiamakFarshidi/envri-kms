And the closest one is returned. It is an interactive image segmentation. Edge detection Canny Edge Detection apply Gaussian filter to smooth the image in order to remove the noise 4. Face Detection Haar CascadesThe algorithm needs a lot of positive images images of faces and negative images images without faces to train the classifier. shape for i in range len contours if hierarchy 0 i 3 1 cv2. 0 d4 d15 group__videoio__flags__base. Corner detection A corner can be interpreted as the junction of two edges where an edge is a sudden change in image brighteness. But in some cases because of factors such as noise the second closest match may seem to be closer to the first. Find contours Find segment using watershed Algorithm 10. Dilation It is just opposite of erosion. FLANN based Matcher 1. append match1 FLANN call function to show image apply otsu method in threshold noise removal option good way to reduce noise sure background area DISTANCE TRANSFORM to seperate the coins close to black will fade way and closer to white will become brighter Finding unknown region Marker labelling Add one to all labels so that sure background is not 0 but 1 Now mark the region of unknown with zero In this case we are not able to dtect the eys because the color of the eyes is not learly visible. Here we use the function cv2. Morphological operator Morphological transformations are some simple operations based on the image shape. RETR_CCOMP extract both interal and external contour external_contour np. This operation processes the edges while removing the noise. Erosion erode The basic idea of erosion is just like soil erosion only it erodes away the boundaries of foreground object Always try to keep foreground in white. Brute force Matching with SIFT Descriptors and Ratio Test3. 8 it means they are rejected. Corner detection algorithm Harris Corner Detection Harris Corner Detector is just a mathematical way of determining which windows produce large variations when moved in any direction. Based on this score you can figure out which ones are corners and which ones are not. Grid Detection findChessboardCorners findCirclesGrid 6. Opening Opening is just another name of erosion followed by dilation. So what does it do The kernel slides through the image as in 2D convolution. It is useful in removing noise. With each window a score R is associated. Draw first 10 matches. jpg attachment haar_features. For this haar features shown in below image are used. Watershed Algorithm A marker based watershed algorithm where you specify which are all valley points are to be merged and which are not. It needs two inputs one is our original image second one is called structuring element or kernel which decides the nature of operation. ration test to check if the first match and the second match are close to each other or not less distance better match for match1 match2 in matches if match1. distance good. OpenCVCompared to other languages like C C Python is slower. Image Gradient image gradient is a directional change in the intensity or color in the image SobelSobel operators is a joint Gausssian smoothing plus differentiation operation so it is more resistant to noise. bilateralFilter A bilateral filter is used for smoothening images and reducing noise while preserving edges. Gamma correction to increase or decrease brightness Gamma correction apply to an image to make it brighter or darker depending on gamma value np. findContours External Counter Internal Counter 7. It takes the descriptor of one feature in first set and is matched with all other features in second set using some distance calculation. This feature helps us to write computationally intensive codes in C C and create a Python wrapper for it so that we can use these wrappers as Python modules. Here a pixel element is 1 if atleast one pixel under the kernel is 1. html gga3a7850640f1fe1f58fe91a2d7583695dac5babb7dfda59544e3e31ea928f8cb16 2. Morphological GradientIt is the difference between dilation and erosion of an image. This is how OpenCV Python works it is a Python wrapper around original C implementation. shape external_contour. In this case we compute the ratio of closest distance to the second closest distance and check if it is above 0. Sort them in the order of their distance. medianBlur The central element of the image is replaced by the median of all the pixels in the kernel area. html ggaa9e58d2860d4afa658ef70a9b1115576a147222a96556ebc1d948b372bcd7ac59 THRESH_BINARY THRESH_BINARY_INV THRESH_TRUNC THRESH_TOZERO THRESH_TOZERO_INV adaptiveThreshold Adaptive thresholding is the method where the threshold value is calculated for smaller regions and therefore there will be different threshold values for different regions. morphologyEx Closing Closing is reverse of Opening Dilation followed by Erosion. It will find a good matching but not necessarily the best possible one. com benai9916 openCV in python Do UPVOTE if you liked this kernel fix the figure size for matplotlin load wrong image wont throw error load correct image convert to RGB Load the image in gray scale since by default it is not in grayscale we will covert it into gray scale flip the image print another rectange cricle Fill the circle or rectange by 1 line choose font new blank image it is in two dimension covert it into three dimension reshape fillpoly shape of both the image resize both the image so that we can blend load image again make img_2 very small assing large image and small image to a variable overy lay small image on the big image load image again make img_2 small in size img_1 shape y axis 1401 x 934 x_offset x of img_1x x axis of img_2 create an ROI Region of interest check rows columns shape grab the ROI get the gray scale version of the image get pure white of mask but the mask contain no channel covert it to 3 channel which part of the large image do we want to blend it is call Region of interest ROI function to show big picture make the figure size big use binary threshold to make pic either white or black call function to show image blend cross_thresh and th2 load image function display image functio call the functions gamma value load image write text on the image define a kernel we are manually choosing value we can play around with the kernel to see different type of blur in the image 1 representing the depth of the output image. Each channel of a multi channel image is processed independently. It is normally performed on binary images. ADAPTIVE_THRESH_GAUSSIAN_C Blurring and Smoothing Blurring and smoothing often combine with edge detection In blurring we simple reduce the edge content and makes the transition form one color to the other very smooth. load image again write text on the image when we increase the kernel size the blurring become more dense load image again write text on the image gaussianblur load image again write text on the image median blur in another image in above image we can see some noise we will try to remove it by median blur load image again write text on the image function to generate white background and generate text display image create kernel with iteration 4 create a background noisy image mix the text image and the noise image removing noise form the image create a foreground noisy image foreground noise verticle line are more visible horizontal line are more visible capture both horizontal and vetical line threshold morpohological operator load three images raimbow image create mask in the above mask select some portion out of it new image to equalize the histogram of a color image to increase the contrast of an image translate the image to HSV grab the value channel covert HSV to RGB load the full image load the subset of image to match shape of both the image create a copy of image TEMPLATE MATCHNG draw rectangle on the detected area plot and show the image read image covert it to float harris corner just to show the corner we use dialat dilate Load image show image detect corner in the real chess image show image load image canny edge detector find the best threshold value choose lower threshold value to either 0 or 70 of median value whichever is greater upper threshold to either 130 of the median or 255 which ever is small Blur and the apply canny edge detection findChessBoardCorners is specifically work with chess board type image cv2. Template matching Template matching is a technique for finding areas of an image that are similar to a patch A patch is a small image with certain features. threshold thresholding is the simplest method of segmenting imageshttps docs. It is useful in closing small holes inside the foreground objects or small black points on the object. If we print the value and we get None shows something is wrong imshow Show image using Matplotlib Matplotlib expect different order of RGB channel when compare with openCV MATPLOTLIB RGB RED GREEN BLUE OPENCV BGR BLUE GREEN RED cvtColor Change channel color imwrite Save the image resize Resize by ratio flip Drawing on image rectangle circle line putText Add text to the image ploylines Draw polygon fillpoly Draw a retangle on dog face Convert RGB to HLS HSV to RGB to HSV to HLS Blending and pasting addWeighted to blend two image only work image with the same size overlay small image on top of a large image no blending Numpy reassignment Blend image of different size Create mask bitwise_not bitwise_or Thresholding threshold is used to convert grayscale images to binary image. Brute force Matching with ORB Descriptors2. Laplacian Derivatives Histograms calcHist to calculate histogram Creata a mask calcHist with mask Histogram equalization equalizeHist Equalize the histogram when we equalize the histogram we increase the contrast in the image equalization for color image Video Object Detection 1. It is the simplest form of object detection we should have the subset of the same image to detect the object 6 methods for comparison https docs. Feature Matching Three method1. steps to find contour using image processing technique1. A pixel in the original image either 1 or 0 will be considered 1 only if all the pixels under the kernel is 1 otherwise it is eroded made to zero. drawContours external_contour contours i 255 1 plt. So it increases the white region in the image or size of foreground object increases. Shi Tomsi Corner Detection If we re scanning the image with a window just as we would with a kernel and we notice that there is an area where there s a major change no matter in what direction we actually scan then we have a good intuition that there s probably a corner there. a Harris corner Detection b Shi Tomasi 3. Brute force Matching with ORB Descriptors Brute Force matcher is simple. Each feature is a single value obtained by subtracting sum of pixels under white rectangle from sum of pixels under black rectangle. FLANN based MatcherFLANN meaning Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors will be much faster but will find an approximate nearest neighbors. org master df dfb group__imgproc__object. html gaeb8dd9c89c10a5c63c139bf7c4f5704d Import Library imread Load image Does not throw any error even if we give the wrong file name. Brute force Matching with SIFT Descriptors and Ratio TestSIFT Scale Invariant Feature Transform The SIFT keypoints between two images are matched by identifying their nearest neighbors. If the ratio is more than 0. jpg We need to load pre train haar cascades classifier For examples on live webcam and videos please check it on my GitHub https github. All the OpenCV array structures are converted to and from Numpy arrays. So whatever operations you can do in Numpy you can combine it with OpenCV which increases the number of weapons in your arsenal. They are just like our convolutional kernel. imshow external_contour create orb instance Create a matching object Match descriptors. This algorithm is useful in segmenting images into background and foreground. Contours Detection A contour is a curve joining all the continuous points having same color or intensity they represent the shapes of objects found in an image. Besides that several other libraries like SciPy Matplotlib which supports Numpy can be used with this. The goal of template matching is to find the patch template in an image. This gives us two advantages first our code is as fast as original C C code since it is the actual C code working in background and Second it is very easy to code in Python. But another important feature of Python is that it can be easily extended with C C. Then we need to extract features from it. 0 d7 d1b group__imgproc__misc. power filter2D we can play around with the kernel to see different type of blur in the image blur The function smooths an image using the kernel GaussianBlur The Gaussian filter is a low pass filter that reduce the high frequency components.
