Train a small YOLOv5 model. Train validation split Prepare Required Folder StructureThe required folder structure for the dataset directory is parent_folder dataset images train val labels train val yolov5 Note that I have named the directory covid. That s why I have used the number of classes nc to be 2. Load image level csv file Modify values in the id column Add absolute path Get image level labels Load meta.

Get the raw bounding box by parsing the row value of the label column. It is saved in this directory runs detect exp3 labels. Each cell in the grid is responsible for detecting objects within itself. WORK IN PROGRESSFinal component is model prediction visualization which is an optional debugging tool I would like to share. txt file with the same name as the image will be created in the format shown below One row per object.

Note We don t have to remove the images without bounding boxes from the training or validation sets. yaml Configuration file weights yolov5s. com c siim covid19 detection discussion 239918.

I am using xhlulu s https www. yaml file needed to train the model. for this example submisison we will use YOLO s classification head. In exp can be 1 2 etc. Bounding box format required for YOLOv5. Move the images to relevant split folder. Consider upvoting if you find the work useful. We can normalize by the boxes in pixels by dividing x_center and width by image width and y_center and height by image height. Since I am training the model in this kernel itself I will not be using the method that I have described above. After training a YOLOv5 based object detector head to the artifacts page and download the best model upload the model as a Kaggle dataset Use it with the submission folder. txt file with a list of validation images 4. png file to get a rough estimate of the threshold go to the Bounding Box Debugger panel and interactively adjust the confidence threshold. Get scaling factor xmin ymin xmax ymax Convert the bounding boxes in YOLO format. YOLOv5 automatically handles the images without any bounding box coordinates. yaml is the dataset configuration file that defines 1. Results Check out W B Run Page rightarrow https wandb. InferenceYou will probably use a Submission. Merge both the dataframes Create train and validation split. Note that you might have to clone the YOLOv5 repository in a Kaggle dataset as well. csv file Original dimensions are required to scale the bounding box coordinates appropriately. Download YOLOv5 repository and pip install the required dependencies. yaml is created in the yolov5 data directory as required.
