{"name": "feature selection with permutation importance ", "full_name": " ", "stargazers_count": 0, "forks_count": 0, "description": "Next let s evaluate what features were selected and let s compare the relative importance i. Step 1 Import Libraries Step 2 Load Data Here you can see the list of features in our dataset. Here we can see a slightly improved performace despite dropping the majority of our features. Here you can see that the most important features were indeed the features that best describe the size and shape of the nuclei e. We know from the biomedical literature that cancer cells often have large and mishapen nuclei. html but in this tutorial we will focus only on the Permutation Importance method. In this way the importance of individual features can be directly compared and a quantitative threshold can be used to determine feature inclusion. As such I suspect that paremeters such as mean area and mean concave points will be especially good predictors. Methods such as this can be used to dispell the notion of machine learning algorithms as irreproducible black boxes and can be used to help gain new insights from machine learning models. coefficient that is assigned to each one. Step 3 Plot Data The first plot confirms my prediction that healthy nuclei have a default size and that cancer cells have a wide range of sizes typically greater than the default size. html END FEATURE SELECTION WITH PERMUTATION IMPORTANCE METHOD Needed to initialize coef_ or feature_importances_. There are many methods for feature selection http scikit learn. Next we will test a Random Forest Classification strategy but first I will need to define some helper functions that can be used to evaluate our results learning curve confusion matrix. One way to explain the behavior of a model is to describe what features were selected and why. In this tutorial we will demonstrate the use of the Permutation Importance feature selection method with the help of the Python library ELI5 http eli5. We now have a model that has many fewer features and is therefore much easier to explain. Likewise the second plot confirms my prediction that healthy nuclei are typically circular elliptical and that cancer cells are mishapen and have a lot of concave points. org stable modules generated sklearn. BEGIN FEATURE SELECTION WITH PERMUTATION IMPORTANCE METHOD http eli5. io en latest blackbox permutation_importance. load_breast_cancer dataset to explore feature selection and permutation importance. As expected the most important features are direct measurements of nuclear size and nuclear shape. For more information please consult the relevant publication https www. Next let s evaluate the importance of each of the features that were used. The features in this dataset are numerical measurements of nuclear size and nuclear shape while the labels refer to the presence or absence of cancer. By removing features we were able to both increase the performance of our model and improve our model s explainability. pdf and documentation http eli5. org stable modules feature_selection. With the Permutation Importance feature selection method the performance of a model is tested after removing each individual feature and replacing that feature with random noise. area radius concavity etc. Feature Selection with Permutation Importance In machine learning it is important to explain why a given model behaves the way that it does. We will be using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer http scikit learn. Now let s try to use the Permutation Importance feature selection method in order to reduce the number of features and hopefully improve our predictive performance. Step 4 Define Helper Functions Step 5 Evaluate Random Forest Classifier The performance of our Random Forest Classifier was quite good even before feature selection. edu breiman randomforest2001. These first two plots are good news and suggest that we will indeed have success in this task of predicting cancer based off of measurements of nuclear shape.
