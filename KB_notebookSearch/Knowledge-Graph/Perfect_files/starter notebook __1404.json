Detection of spark erosion in Insulation JointsAuthor Oscar van Hees oscar. The image will be normalized and cropped to the region of interest. We will use the Intersection over Union method. In this case we crop both sides of the images such that we only look at the rail with its insulation joint. IoU is an evaluation metric used to measure the accuracy of an object detector or image segmentation on a particular dataset. load the modelFor this project we used a unet model which is a type of model often used for image segmantation. set paths read image normailize the image crop Read ground truth image return pink values into Reshape Predict the picture Add probability value normally higher than 50 plot the spark erosion prediction. com abreheret PixelAnnotationTool. Lets predict an image. Each mask contains an array with vallues 0 and 1. nl This project was performed by Olivier Spliethof who worked at ProRail at the time. The image of the rail above shows a clear insulation joint the horizontal line. To see the spark erosion better we created a mask by annotating each pixel with the help of the PixelAnnotationTool https github. We can evaluate how good the region is predicted. Note please run all cells one by one in order for the notebook to work properly. The spark erosion is harder to detect and can be found just above the insulation joint the small withe dotted area.
