Comparison of real and predicted values Test data The most important feature deciding players salary is minutes per game. Because of position there is almost no correlation between averaging blocks and assists per game. These prediction results are multiplied by the weighting coefficients of the respective weak classifiers and added. 4 nbsp nbsp Turnover Ranking2. 2 nbsp nbsp AdaBoost Data Wrangling Data from Kaggle https www.

For those who have more playing time next important features are PER and Age. jpg attachment hqdefault. For the two class problem 1 1 each weak classifier will calculate a prediction result of 1 or 1. Players are more efficient and more aged tend to have higher salary. 3 nbsp nbsp High Age Players Ranking2. When the time is less than 31. The final model is the addition of K weak classifiers.

If the final result is greater than 0 it is predicted to be positive 1 otherwise it is predicted to be negative 1. 1 nbsp nbsp Average Points Per Game Ranking2. Of course each base classifier is multiplied by its own weight. Data preprocessing is really important for predicting. When play time longer than 31 minuates which is standard for starting players the expectation of salary is 18 millions dollars. Which position is the most prone to turnovers Answer Point Guards Who has the most blocks no doubt PreprocessingMost variables are skew thus we should rescale them. Dependent Variable Algorithms CARTThe new transformed features has been standardize for example age. 4 minuates the average salary is just 5.
