Hence we need a custom data generator. be 1D2j8nTjOZ4 t 1946 Basic Description of the Data ProvidedWe are provided with a train and test set of time series data containing simulated gravitational wave measurements from a network of 3 gravitational wave interferometers LIGO Hanford LIGO Livingston VirgoEach time series contains either detector noise or detector noise plus a simulated gravitational wave signal. DataGenerator Sequence Now let s go through the details of how to set the Python class DataGenerator which will be used for real time data feeding to your Keras model. pdf From Wikipedia https en. Other waves are predicted to be caused by the rotation of neutron stars that are not perfect spheres and possibly even the remnants of gravitational radiation created by the Big Bang. The 3 series from the 3 Interferometer have fairly similar distribution for both the class types. Time Domain vs Frequency Domain Analysis A Time domain analysis is an analysis of physical signals mathematical functions or time series of economic or environmental data in reference to time. Finally you have ten nodes in the output layer. The method __getitem__ should return a complete batch. But in practice for most practical use cases almost all datasets are large and cannot be loaded into memory at once. So basically data science helping here by building models to filter out this noises from data streams which includes both noise frequencies and Gravitational Waves frequencies so we can single out frequencies for Gravitational Waves. In fact you can connect layers to literally any other layer. Hz which means per second is widely used for sample rate. or CQT kernels can be trained. You pass your whole dataset at once in fit method. But in a Sequence API there is an index parameter to the __getitem__ function so no iteration or yield is required this is performed by Keras for you. Thermal noise due to Brownian motion will be the most dominant noise source in the most sensitive frequency range of the instruments. nnAudio nnAudio is an audio processing toolbox using PyTorch convolutional neural network as its backend. As the output of the transform is effectively amplitude phase against log frequency fewer frequency bins are required to cover a given range effectively and this proves useful where frequencies span several octaves. zip Checking the contents of one file print data 0. Pooling This type of layer is used to reduce the dimensionality of an input layer. npy files Get all the file file path from all 4 labels of nested folder structure get the list of ids from the. read_csv root_dir training_labels. csv Also Note we have earlier defined our labels to be the below labels pd. Also use it if you can load whole data into your memory small dataset. The common architecture of ConvNets is a sequential architecture. For example say in a multi modal classification problem which needs to process text and image data simultaneously. As a result creating complex networks such as siamese networks and residual networks become possible. I only have a casual understanding of both types of transforms myself so take what I m saying with a grain of salt. This is very well explained by by Professor Rana Adhikari of Caltech and a member of the LIGO team who were the first to measure gravitational waves. npy files from all the nested folder structure and get the ids from file names Basic CQT EDA and A quick Note on nnAudio and CQT Q TransformThe constant quality factor transform CQT introduced by J. A standard DFT uses a constant window size throughout all frequencies. org wiki Constant Q_transform In mathematics and signal processing the constant Q transform simply known as CQT transforms a data series to the frequency domain. Alternatively the functional API allows you to create models that have a lot more flexibility as you can easily define models where layers connect to more than just the previous and next layers. Some common layer types in Keras are as follows Dense This is a fully connected layer in which all the nodes of the layer aredirectly connected to all the inputs and all the outputs. We can move from time domain to frequency domain with the help of Fourier transform. Assume that you have 3 072input variables then you need to create the first hidden layer with 512nodes neurons. org api_docs python tf keras utils Sequence Every Sequence must implement the __getitem__ and the __len__ methods. 89 1 425 434 1991. In other words it is a type of wavelet transform. This is an issue for emulating human perception because humans perceive frequency on a logarithmic scale. jpg In this competition you are provided with a training set of time series data containing simulated gravitational wave measurements from a network of 3 gravitational wave interferometers LIGO Hanford LIGO Livingston and Virgo. Brown Calculation of a constant Q spectral transform J. In general the transform is well suited to musical data and proves useful where frequencies span several octaves. Each time series contains either detector noise or detector noise plus a simulated gravitational wave signal. See his interview here https youtu. The solution is to use fit_generator and predict_generator with custom data generator functions which can load data to memory during training or predicting. Kapre and torch stft have a similar concept in which they also use 1D convolution from Keras and PyTorch to do the waveforms to spectrogram conversions. For example an imagemaps onto ten nodes that shows the probability of being label1 airplane label2 automobile label3 cat. As it is written in keras documentation generator is used when you want to avoid duplicate data when using multiprocessing. Final Model Building pip install astropy 4. The format is designed to be as simple as possible while achieving its limited goals. CQT refers to a time frequency representation where the frequency bins are geometrically spacedand the Q factors ratios of the center frequencies to bandwidths of all bins are equal. Sequence so that we can leverage nice functionalities such as multiprocessing. train_labels pd. The node of highestprobability is the predicted class label. 3019084 Paper nnAudio a new neural network based audio processing framework with graphics processing unit GPU support that leverages 1D convolutional neural networks to perform time domain to frequency domain conversion. Common types of pooling include max pooling in which the maximum value ofa given window is passed through to the output or average pooling in whichthe average value of a window is passed through. csv nrows 1000 Now I shall genereate train indices validation indices and test indices Which are just the values from the 0 based indices print len train_indices test_indices print train_generator_for_seq_model 1 Epoch took around 2 and half hours. There are other layer types in Keras however these are the most common types whenit comes to building models using Keras. The transform mirrors the human auditory system whereby at lower frequencies spectral resolution is better whereas temporal resolution improves at higher frequencies. There are times when a model is fed with multiple types of inputs at once. for Train data values of column id from training_labels. It is limited in that it does not allow you to create models that share layers or have multiple inputs or outputs. While the processes that generate gravitational waves can be extremely violent and destructive by the time the waves reach Earth they are thousands of billions of times smaller In fact by the time gravitational waves from LIGO s first detection reached us the amount of space time wobbling they generated was a 1000 times smaller than the nucleus of an atom Such inconceivably small measurements are what LIGO was designed to make. In keras fit is much similar to sklearn s fit method where you pass array of features as x values and target as y values. In the second hidden layer you have 120 nodes neurons. Einstein s mathematics showed that massive accelerating objects such as neutron stars or black holes orbiting each other would disrupt space time in such a way that waves of undulating space time would propagate in all directions away from the source. A Constant Q transform is a variation on the Discrete Fourier Transform DFT. Plotting KDE Boxplot and Timeseries As we are provided with a train and test set of time series data from a network of 3 gravitational wave interferometers LIGO Hanford LIGO Livingston Virgo Basic observation from Box Plots 1. Here obviously we cannot use ImageDataGenerator. ANNs that model sequential datasuch as natural language or time series data often feature one or more recurrentlayer types. And we have a total of 5 60 000 files each file of dimension of 3 4096 this turns out to be a huge time series What are Gravitational Waves Gravitational waves are ripples in space time caused by some of the most violent and energetic processes in the Universe. Sampling frequency in a TimeSeriesThe sampling frequency or sample rate is the number of equal spaced samples per unit of time. However the constant bin size for all frequencies leads to some problems when you map frequency on a logarithmic scale. shape print data 1. LIGO s discovery will go down in history as one of humanity s greatest scientific achievements. A Constant Q transform seeks to solve this problem by increasing the window size for lower frequencies and alleviate some of the computational strain caused by this by reducing the window size used for high frequencies. The transform exhibits a reduction in frequency resolution with higher frequency bins which is desirable for auditory applications. Specifically peaks on the lower end are incredibly wide sometimes up to half an octave lacking any sort of detail. This is for practical purpose when you have large dataset. ANNs for the classification of images usually feature one ormore convolutional layers in their architecture. In other words a Constant Q transform will yield better results where low frequencies and logarithmic frequency mapping are concerned. ANNs for classification orregression tasks on tabular data usually have a large percentage of their layers withthis type in the architecture. chdir content gdrive MyDrive G2Net_Gravitational_Waves kaggle competitions download c g2net gravitational wave detection Unzip Data unzip content gdrive MyDrive G2Net_Gravitational_Waves g2net gravitational wave detection. How much of the signal lie in different frequency range. The format stores all of the shape and data type information necessary to reconstruct the array correctly even on another machine with a different architecture. For instance if you have 96 equally spaced observation per day then you sampling rate is 96 day or 96 24 3600 0. The original paper reference below Judith C. Extract 1 random element from the target_0_df_train using random_state to ensure the reproducibility of the examples. edu Physics brown pubs cq1stPaper. nnAudio however leverages the compute unified device architecture CUDA of 1D convolutional neural network from PyTorch its short time Fourier transform STFT Mel spectrogram and constant Q transform CQT implementations are an order of magnitude faster than other implementations using only the central processing unit CPU. It is more useful in the identification of instruments. 3 billion light years away. npy data file contains 3 time series 1 coming for each detector and each spans 2 sec and is sampled at 2 048 Hz. The computational complexity of a Constant Q transform is only slightly larger than that of a standard DFT but because the window size changes per frequency it is impossible to apply the typical optimizations of the FFT to a Constant Q transform. Furthermore an oscilloscope is a tool commonly used to see real world signals in the time domain. org wp content uploads 2016 02 gwaves_feat new. computations from source files without worrying about data generation becoming a bottleneck in the training process. In a generator function you would use the yield keyword to perform iteration inside a while True loop so each time Keras calls the generator it gets a batch of data and it automatically wraps around the end of the data. csv and the argument data is that label here. edu page what are gw On September 14 2015 for the very first time LIGO Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory physically sensed the undulations in spacetime caused by gravitational waves generated by two colliding black holes 1. While we have built in Data Generator like ImageDataGenerator https www. environ KAGGLE_CONFIG_DIR content gdrive MyDrive Kaggle_Datasets os. Other GPU audio processing tools are torchaudio and tf. In short you create a sequential model where you can easily add layers and each layer can have convolution max pooling activation drop out and batch normalization. Also in the time domain the signal or function s value is understood for all real numbers at various separate instances in the case of discrete time or the case of continuous time. A note on yield function with respect to the custom data generator here for Sequence API of KerasHere I am using the Sequence API which works a bit different than plain generators. Note on Keras Sequential modelThere are two ways to build Keras models sequential and functional. The task is to identify when a signal is present in the data target 1. It is related to the Fourier transform 1 and very closely related to the complex Morlet wavelet transform. We make DataGenerator inherit the properties of keras. npy files 1 means the last element in a sequence print ids_from_npy_files get a dataframe with paths and ids of those. These layers are often usedin conjunction with a convolutional layer and their purpose is to reduce thedimensions of the subsequent layers allowing for fewer training parameters to belearned with little information loss. This file format makes incredibly fast reading speed enhancement over reading from plain text or CSV files. It allows on the fly spectrogram extraction due to its fast speed without the need to store any spectrograms on the disk. It s pretty effective at this but has a few drawbacks. Brown in 1988 is an interesting alternative to the windowed Fourier transform STFT Short Time Fourier Transform or wavelets for time frequency analysis. In fit_generator you don t pass the x and y directly instead they come from a generator. Why I would need a Custom Data Generator Function for Keras Sequential Model buildingThe key reason is to be able to handle large data with batching so the RAM CPU GPU does not need to handle the full data at once which will anyway not be possible for this 72GB dataset. Moreover this approach also allows back propagation on the waveforms to spectrograms transformation layer and hence the transformation process can be made trainable further optimizing the waveform to spectrogram transformation for the specific task that the neural network is trained on. These cosmic ripples would travel at the speed of light carrying with them information about their origins as well as clues to the nature of gravity itself. The sensitivity of advanced gravitational wave detectors will be limited by multiple sources of noise from the hardware subsystems and the environment. The non Gaussian and nonstationary nature of advanced detector noise may produce glitches which could affect the sensitivity of searches and be mistaken as gravitational wave detections in particular for unmodelled sources. If you want to modify your dataset between epochs you may implement on_epoch_end. Sampling rate or Sampling frequency is the rate at which we are capturing amplitudes. The constant Q transform transforms a data series to the frequency domain. According to Keras Documentation https www. Some basic definition Wha are. As the range of human hearing covers approximately ten octaves from 20 Hz to around 20 kHz this reduction in output data is significant. All spectrogram implementations scale as Big O of linear time with respect to the input length. Difference between fit and fit_generator in KerasIn Keras using fit and predict is fine for smaller datasets which can be loaded into memory. At frequencies higher than 150 Hz shot noise due to quantum uncertainties in the laser light is expected to be the dominant noise source. Recurrent Recurrent layers learn patterns from sequences so each output isdependent on the results from the previous step. Albert Einstein predicted the existence of gravitational waves in 1916 in his general theory of relativity. You can create a Sequential model by passing a list of layer instances to the constructor. From the definition of Keras documentation the Sequential model is a linear stack of layers. With the Sequential Models you need to ensure theinput layer has the right number of inputs. npy files merging that above df with the target verifying the shape of the merged df has 5 60 000 rows and 3 columns Classify the the 2 classes of targets of 1 and 0 First quickly check the shape of my df_train that I earlier defined Function to show the CQT Spectogram print cqt_image i cqt_image Defining a multi plot function And I am going to call the 3 series as Series 1 Series 2 and Series 3 As in the case of time based plot I wan 3 rows Extract 1 random element from the target_1_df_train using random_state to ensure the reproducibility of the examples. Instrumental and environmental disturbances can also produce non astrophysical triggers in science data so called glitches as well as increasing the false alarm rate of searches and producing a decrease in the detectors duty cycles. npy files It is a standard binary file format for persisting a single arbitrary NumPy array on disk. The task is to identify when a signal is present in the data target 1. Moreover a time domain graph can show how a signal changes with time. Sources of Noise in Gravitational Waves Signal data and how Data Science can helpNoise of non astrophysical origin contaminates data taken by LIGO. The strongest gravitational waves are produced by cataclysmic events such as colliding black holes supernovae massive stars exploding at the end of their lifetimes and colliding neutron stars. The implementation is intended to be pure Python and distributed as part of the main numpy package. org api_docs python tf keras preprocessing image ImageDataGenerator we still need a plethora of custom Generator function. This typically leads to a pretty consistent fully continuous transform. For this dataset the list_IDs are the value of the ids for each of the time series file i. So basically since our code will in most cases be multicore friendly so we focus on doing more complex operations e. The low frequency sensitivity of the detectors 10 Hz will be limited by the effects of seismic noise. The sequential API allows you to create models layer by layer for most problems. get the range to to feed to keras for each epoch incrementing by 1 the bath_size We have 5 60 000 files each with dimension of 3 4096 build the file name there are three nesting labels inside train or test print X print len train_labels 5 60 000 print len sample_submission 2 26 000 train_ids 00000e74ad 00001f4945 0000661522. It is related to the Fourier transform. For example siamese networks are two parallel neural networks with some shared layers. This is made so the sequence can run in parallel using multiprocessing which is not possible with old generator functions. However some architectures are not linear stacks. But they are not using the neural network approach and hence the Fourier basis can not be trained. These amplitudes can be electric or magnetic fileds in the case of light waves current or voltage in the case of digital signals and pressure or displacement values for the case of sound waves. shape print data 2. In Frequency domain your model system is analyzed according to it s response for different frequencies. In other words it is just the number of data points recorded per second. This convolution can occur in oneor multiple dimensions. In above sr represents Sampling rate. In general the transform is well suited to musical data and this can be seen in some of its advantages compared to the fast Fourier transform. By doing so spectrograms can be generated from audio on the fly during neural network training and the Fourier kernels e. shape data_1 The gwpy s TimeSeries function expects array like input data array as its first argument and sample_rate float Quantity optional the rate of samples per second Hertz Plotting the 3 TimeSeries Construct a Training dataframe for all the available. From this https www. Unlike the Fourier transform but similar to the mel scale the constant Q transform Wikipedia uses a logarithmically spaced frequency axis. mount content gdrive import os One time ONLY Installation of Kaggle package pip install upgrade force reinstall no deps kaggle TO IMPORT DATA ONE TIME CODE os. Theoretically signals are composed of many sinusoidal signals with different frequencies Fourier series like triangle signal its actually composed of infinite sinusoidal signal fundamental and odd harmonics frequencies. Because Model training is not limited to a single type of input and target. Convolutional This layer type creates a convolutional kernel that is convolved withthe input layer to produce a tensor of outputs. So we need to use the training data along with the target value to build our model and make predictions on the test IDs in form of probability that the target exists for that ID.
