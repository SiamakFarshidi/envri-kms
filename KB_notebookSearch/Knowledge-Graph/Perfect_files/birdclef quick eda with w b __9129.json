The other half is simply repeated in inverse indices order. We will use Weights and Biases to visualize different spectrograms. Create an account on https wandb. com r MachineLearning comments 4ea0m7 audio_normalizationpreprocessing_before. time The time of the day the recording was uploaded. Most commom birds vocalization found Many segments are associated with nocall. You can visualize the waveform of the audio beside listening to the music with just 3 lines of code. Trim audio Log clipped and trimmed audio compute fft compute frequency get the magnitude Remember 2nd half of the fft is repeated. rucwar bobfly1 etc are commonly found. Plot spectrogram Note cqt_note y axis Short time Fourier transform STFT Convert an amplitude spectrogram to Decibels scaled spectrogram. org stable modules generated sklearn. log audio data for each label per step. There are segments with two or more birds volcalization found. Pro tip 2 Click on the Edit panel icon in the chart to visualize the expanded version of the bar chart. birds primary label i. url The xenocanto. csv for each row_id time window you need to provide a space delimited list of the set of unique birds that made a call beginning or ending in that time window. The audio recordings are downsampled to 32kHz and are in ogg format https en. Linear Power Spectrogram n_fft 2048 samples corresponds to a physical duration of 93 milliseconds at a sample rate of 22050 Hz. Again I am not sure if it s going to be useful. Audio Features Preprocessing Audio Normalization Note that this constrained each signal between 0 and 1. com andradaolteanu birdcall recognition eda and audio fe SHP file Coordinate reference system Lat and Long need to be of type float not object Create geometry Geo Dataframe Create ID for species Add ID to geo_df PLOT display W B run page add new key label to dict get NUM_AUDIO_PER_LABEL audio filenames per label append path to that file We will use Weights and Biases to visualize audio waveforms and listen to bird sounds. nocall references a segment without any bird vocalization. ai ayush thakur birdclef runs 1grwh85p workspace user ayush thakur Disclaimer Since there are too many labels the specied_id y axis looks clumsy. seconds End time of the 5 second segment for which this entry states the label. Pro tip 1 Click on the in the audio samples chart above. display W B run page. org url to d What s the distribution of primary labels What quality of audio recording available Thankfully most of the audio is high quality. I highly recommend spending time listening to the sample audio. Where are the birds located Most of the audio recordings come from North and South America. When was the audio uploaded Most of the recordings were uploaded in the year between 2012 and 2020. Change species_id to select different label Load unnormalized audio Normalize audio sampling rate is number of samples per second. A recorded audio may be gradually reduced to silence at its end fade out or may gradually increase from silence at the beginning fade in. We will visualize linear frequency power spectrogram for audio with rating 4 and more. Note By trimming we are losing on the background sound but there s no control over what is lost. Click on the in the clipped_vs_trimmed chart above. train_soundscape_labels. csv Same tabular information as train_soundscape_labels. Note that I have only logged spectrogram for 20 labels. Image name Load audio Compute spectrogram Short time Fourier transform STFT Convert an amplitude spectrogram to Decibels scaled spectrogram. csv Reference https www. eBird code of the audible species of this segment. Here s a short reddit post https www. train_soundscapes Directory of audio files that are comparable to the data that we will encounter in the test set. W B Run Page https wandb. ai ayush thakur birdclef runs 2713uqst workspace user ayush thakur Note The dashboard above have 8 samples of audio for each label. Note that there is numerical difference while computing FFT using TensorFlow and Numpy. Some quick observations The audio duration varies from few seconds to few minutes. display W B run page A sample audio. There s significant class imbalance. It might be useful preprocessing step after getting 5 second clips. Each audio player s caption is the label name. There are some major regions of frequency concentration that too in high frequency region. If there are no bird calls in a time window use the code nocall. Save as spectrogram Note linear y axis log audio data for each label per step. Plot spectrogram Note logarithmic yaxis Short time Fourier transform STFT Convert an amplitude spectrogram to Decibels scaled spectrogram. SpectrogramA spectrogram is a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies of a signal as it varies with time. The submissions will be evaluated based on their row wise micro averaged F1 score https scikit learn. com product feedback 114053 1. latitude and longitude Location where the recording was done. author Individual s name who recorded possibly and uploaded the audio. Species crfpar and stvhum2 got only 8 audio files. date The date the audio was recorded possibly and uploaded. Log Power Spectrogram Constant Q Note Power Spectrogram Constant Q Hz Power Spectrogram Tempogram with BPM markers Chromagram with Pitch Classes Let s look at the spectrogram for every class using W B. This is the raw audio that s mentioned in the goal. csv primary_label The primary bird sound that can be heard in the recording. In this competition 4 different sites COL Colombia COR Costa Rica SNE Sierra Nevada SSW Sapsucker Woods are included. The audio is noisy with the sound of rain insects humans talking wind blowing etc. About the competition Goal Indentify the species of the birds given raw audio in the wild. Get random samples for each label. This data will be used to train fine grained audio classifier. filename The name of the audio file. nocall can never appear together with other codes. com stefankahl birdclef2021 exploring the data row_id Unique identifier of a 5 second segment of each soundscape file. We thus need to build a multi label classifier. type The type of bird sound. Also note that some of the years are wrong ex 2104 0199 etc. common_name The bird known in common language. The recordings are are all roughly ten minutes long and in the ogg format. Understanding the given data Training data train_short_audio Directory of short recordings of individual bird calls generously uploaded by users of xenocanto. Pro tip 1 Scroll over the bar chart to look at the number of recordings per species_id. In some audio the sound of bird is coming from far off distance. Evaluation In the submission. Each step is a unique pair of audio clip and it s trimmed counterpart. csv This csv can be used to build the inference pipeline. A fair share of recordings are from Europe. Input your personal API token key to login mine is added as Kaggle Secrets https www. About Weights and BiasesThink of W B like GitHub for machine learning models. The Audio Files TL DR for train_short_audio Usage To train fine grained multi class label audio classifier. Number of recordings per label Listen to AudioWe will use Weights and Biases to visualize audio waveforms and listen to bird sounds. Fast Fourier Transform Note that while computing FFT the relevant information is in the first half of the array. Pro tip 3 In the recordings_per_label_table you can sort the columns in ascending or descending order by clicking on the column name. Trim the noise Note how the initial and final silent waveform is removed. Spectral CentroidThe spectral centroid indicates at which frequency the energy of a spectrum is centered upon or in other words It indicates where the center of mass for a sound is located. While 12 labels got 500 audio files each. Pro tip 2 The audio will appear for the selected step label.

Fade In and Fade Out http This Wikipedia page might be a good read. Segments can have more than one bird in that case eBird codes are separated by space. There are approximately 80 recordings during submission that will be will be roughly 10 minutes long and in ogg audio format. Testing data test_soundscapes Directory of recordings to be used for scoring. Plot spectrogram Note linear y axis Short time Fourier transform STFT Convert an amplitude spectrogram to Decibels scaled spectrogram. With a few lines of code save everything you need to debug compare and reproduce your models architecture hyperparameters model weights GPU usage and even datasets and predictions.

Filenames contain the file ID recording site and recording date yyyymmdd. Not sure if it would be a great idea to normalize the audio like this. Click on the in the linear power spectrogram chart above to visualize the spectrogram per label. For training a neura network it might not be an issue. license The license associated with that recording.
