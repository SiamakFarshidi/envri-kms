The application will allow execution of predefined templates or you can configure your own scenario. g day year Number Interval Matcher search for numeric intervals of time definition parametrized e. the execution rules are defined under the root key Incubation Matcher Time Matcher will identify The virus has an incubation period of 14 days Incubation Matcher Time Interval Matcher will identify The virus has an imbubation period of 10 to 14 days Mortality Rate Matcher Year Matcher Percent Matcher will identify The reported mortality rate for over 60 years old is 30.

For performance concerns most of the searches were perfomed on a filtered dataset if you wish to have a more accurate response replace filtered_df with df SimulatorIn order to understand the importance of isolation I wrote a simulator that takes into account housing commercial virus characteristics and social interactions. The plot will show most common NOUNS used to relate a false positive negative and they are converted to a Pandas dataset along with the referencing literature Antigen references Get string representation The matched span for article in literature regex r CF regex r antigen antibod text text. replace antigens. 4 7 4 1 5 1 6 1 7 1 virus_match checks if any virus term is referenced in the text Prepare COVID 19 Literature dataset Define rule matching execution functionsWhen executing a set of rules on a text body the order of the mathcers will be appended to the matching array that will allow the user to define conditional executions when rules match. Rule example rule Matchers Term Matcher LOWER incubation LOWER period OP Time Matcher matchers Number Suffix Matcher days weeks Time Interval Matcher matchers Number Interval Matcher days weeks root Term Matcher execute lambda x print x Time Matcher incubation_period_report Time Interval Matcher incubation_period_report A rule is made of Matchers and executors starting with root executor. The current version of the notebook is providing information about the following Symptoms Incubation Period Quarantine Transmission Methods Reported Gender Percentiles Reported Fatality Rate Relevant gene sequences appearance in sentence and file False Positives Negatives Antigen references literature Added Pandemic Simulator AppThe mining is running on a custom rule matching engine built on top of Spacy in order to use POS in terms identification. g minute day year plot_dict utility to plot a dictionary dict_counter increase or set the value of a key in the dictionary day_value report the time value in days report_interval populates dictionary with values for an interval e. strip antibody antibodies. Period is optional Mortality Rate Matcher mortality rate terms in the sentence. is used to filter the dataset when specific referentiation is needed symptoms list of generic symptoms organs list of human organs higher_terms list of terms that are used to define the starting point of an age group lower_terms list of terms that are used to define the end of an age group Defined generic Spacy pattern matchers and util librarythe patterns will be used in order to assemble a set of rules to identify the desired sequence of patterns matchers Term Matcher lookout for a single term Terms Matcher lookout in a list of terms Number Suffix Matcher search for numeric value preceeded by a time definition parametrized e. The example above defines the following matchers Term Matcher looks for the term incubation and optionally period Time Matcher matches all time references in days weeks Time Interval Matcher matches all time intervals in days weeksThe next item in the dictionary is root that defines the preferred matching order execution if the order is not satisfied then the matcher executor won t get called Term Matcher Time Matcher Term Matcher Time Interval MatcherIf the matcher rule has the execute key present in the dictionary then the rule will get executed even if further specific matchers will get called later Virus SymptomsSearch for virus references and its symptoms in all articles that have a coronavirus reference and at least one term in symptoms dictionarySince is really important to understand the symptoms the search will be performed on the entire article dataset with no filter. Affected OrgansSearch for list of possible human organs affected by COVID 19 Gender ReportMine for any gender age intervals reports Fatality Rate Reported fatality rates scrape the COVID 19 reference literature for mortality fatality rate matchers percent reports. Incubation PeriodThe first analysis is parsing filtered articles that might refer to COVID 19 incubation period. Screenshot https www. The lookout will be performed at the sentence level and not at the full body level for a better approximation. Link To Simulator https www. For the moment the term incubation period is searched in text abstract in order to identify the potential articles. Given the following example rule Matchers Incubation Matcher LOWER incubation LOWER period OP Mortality Rate Matcher LOWER mortality LOWER rate OP Percent Matcher matchers Number Suffix Matcher percent Time Matcher matchers Number Suffix Matcher days weeks Time Interval Matcher matchers Number Interval Matcher days weeks Year Matcher matchers Number Suffix Matcher years old Year Interval Matcher matchers Number Interval Matcher years old root Incubation Matcher Time Matcher incubation_period_report Time Interval Matcher incubation_period_report Mortality Rate Matcher Year Matcher Percent Matcher mortality_report Year Interval Matcher Percent Matcher mortality_report matchers are documented below Will define a rule where the engine will look for the following Incubation Matcher incubation period terms in the sentence. Mortality Rate Matcher Year Interval Matcher Percent Matcher will identify The reported mortality rate for patients between 20 and 30 years old uis 0. com watch v HykbOsHWDSY Custom Rule Execution Sequence EngineIn order to perform a more refined search that takes into account various rules of execution a custom engine was designed such that it can combine Spacys Pattern Matcher strategy with a preffered sequence execution of the matchers. Rate is optional Percent matcher will identify all percentile references in the code Time Matcher will identify all numeric terms like 5 days 1 day Time Interval Matcher will identify all numeric intervals in days weeks 4 to 6 days 10 12 weeks Year Matcher will identify all numeric terms like 60 years Year Interval Matcher will identify all numeric intervals in years 56 80 years 10 to 12 years. low employment rate https www.
