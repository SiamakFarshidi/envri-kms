Price Prediction Of Diamonds Regression diamands 20project. We can also examine other attributes in hue with less value count. IMPORTING LIBRARIES 1 2. There are 10 attributes included in the dataset including the target ie. LOADING DATA 2 3. The main purpose of a diamond table is to refract entering light rays and allow reflected light rays from within the diamond to meet the observer s eye. The table featured should be capped too. Let us have a look at them. Points to notice x y and z show a high correlation to the target column. One carat equals 1 5 gram and is subdivided into 100 points. Next up we will remove these data points. Diamonds without inclusions or blemishes are rare however most characteristics can only be seen with magnification. Colourless diamonds are the rarest. png attachment diamands 20project 20 281 29. Let s have a look at regression plots to get a close look at the outliers. We lost 20 data points by deleting the dimensionless 2 D or 1 D diamonds. We can clearly spot outliers in these attributes. color from J worst to D best The colour of gem quality diamonds occurs in many hues. FIN 5 LIBRARIES Importing LibrariesLOADING DATA Loading DataThis classic dataset contains the prices and other attributes of almost 54 000 diamonds. Now that we have removed regression outliers let us have a look at the pair plot of data in our hand. If you liked this Notebook please do upvote. List of all the pipelines Dictionary of pipelines and model types for ease of reference Fit the pipelines Model prediction on test data Model Evaluation. png depth total depth percentage z mean x y 2 z x y 43 79 The depth of the diamond is its height in millimetres measured from the culet bottom tip to the table flat top surface. If you have any suggestions or questions I am all ears Best Wishes FIN This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed It is defined by the kaggle python Docker image https github. Dimensions x length in mm 0 10. png attachment diamands 20project. So we need to filter out those as it clearly faulty data points. Pairplot Of Data A few points to notice in these pair plots There are some features with datapoint that are far from the rest of the dataset which will affect the outcome of our regression model. Next we will deal with the categorical variables. Dropping the outliers. y and z have some dimensional outlies in our dataset that needs to be eliminated. table width of the top of the diamond relative to widest point 43 95 A diamond s table refers to the flat facet of the diamond seen when the stone is face up. Feature description price price in US dollars 326 18 823 This is the target column containing tags for the features. The 4 Cs of Diamonds carat 0. Lable encoding the data to get rid of object dtype. DATA PREPROCESSING 3 4. read_csv Input data files are available in the read only. 01 The carat is the diamond s physical weight measured in metric carats. MODEL BUILDING Model Building Steps involved in Model Building Setting up features and target Build a pipeline of standard scalar and model for five different regressors. 9 z depth in mm 0 31. Get list of categorical variables Make copy to avoid changing original data Apply label encoder to each column with categorical data correlation matrix Assigning the featurs as X and trarget as y Building pipelins of standard scaler and model for varios regressors. depth cut and table show low correlation. com kaggle docker python For example here s several helpful packages to load linear algebra data processing CSV file I O e. The more precise the diamond is cut the more captivating the diamond is to the eye. Let s test this model on a test set and evaluate it with different parameters. MODEL BUILDING 4 5. 8 diamands 20project 20 281 29. We can clearly spot outliers in these attributes. We could consider dropping but let s keep it. The ideal table cut diamond will give the diamond stunning fire and brilliance. input directory For example running this by clicking run or pressing Shift Enter will list all files under the input directory You can write up to 20GB to the current directory kaggle working that gets preserved as output when you create a version using Save Run All You can also write temporary files to kaggle temp but they won t be saved outside of the current session All the libralies used in this project The first column seems to be just index Dropping dimentionless diamonds Let s have a look at data shades for hue I chose cut as hue. cut Fair Good Very Good Premium Ideal In determining the quality of the cut the diamond grader evaluates the cutter s skill in the fashioning of the diamond. Carat weight is the most objective grade of the 4Cs. That s a much cleaner dataset. We have three categorical variables. Points to notice Min value of x y z are zero this indicates that there are faulty values in data that represents dimensionless or 2 dimensional diamonds. clarity I1 worst SI2 SI1 VS2 VS1 VVS2 VVS1 IF best Diamonds can have internal characteristics known as inclusions or external characteristics known as blemishes. In the range from colourless to light yellow or light brown. DATA PREPROCESSING Data Preprocessing Steps involved in Data Preprocessing Data cleaning Identifying and removing outliers Encoding categorical variablesThe first column is an index Unnamed 0 and thus we are going to remove it. Fit all the models on training data Get mean of cross validation on the training set for all the models for negative root mean square error Pick the model with the best cross validation score Fit the best model on the training set and get Testing the Model with the best score on the test set In the above scores XGBClassifier appears to be the model with the best scoring on negative root mean square error. 74 y width in mm 0 58. The depth should be capped but we must examine the regression line to be sure.
