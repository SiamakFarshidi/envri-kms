What are the symptoms of breast cancer Signs and symptoms of breast cancer may include A breast lump or thickening that feels different from the surrounding tissue Change in the size shape or appearance of a breast Changes to the skin over the breast such as dimpling A newly inverted nipple Peeling scaling crusting or flaking of the pigmented area of skin surrounding the nipple areola or breast skin Redness or pitting of the skin over your breast like the skin of an orange Exploratory Data Analysis Aim Understand the data A small step forward is better than a big one backwards Begin to develop a modelling strategy Features Patient_ID unique identifier id of a patient Age age at diagnosis Years Gender Male Female Protein1 Protein2 Protein3 Protein4 expression levels undefined units Tumour_Stage I II III Histology Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma Infiltrating Lobular Carcinoma Mucinous Carcinoma ER status Positive Negative PR status Positive Negative HER2 status Positive Negative Surgery_type Lumpectomy Simple Mastectomy Modified Radical Mastectomy Other DateofSurgery Date on which surgery was performed in DD MON YY DateofLast_Visit Date of last visit in DD MON YY can be null in case the patient didn t visited again after the surgery Patient_Status Alive Dead can be null in case the patient didn t visited again after the surgery and there is no information available whether the patient is alive or dead. After skin cancer breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in women in the United States. Breast cancer survival rates have increased and the number of deaths associated with this disease is steadily declining largely due to factors such as earlier detection a new personalized approach to treatment and a better understanding of the disease. com dorianvoydie pokemon stats Fish Classification Using CNN 97 acc. It consists of removing samples from the majority class under sampling and or adding more examples from the minority class over sampling. Breast cancer can occur in both men and women but it s far more common in women. Let s implement a basic example which uses the DataFrame. I could have tried to oversample instead If you like please upvote Also check my other notebooks EDA Modelling Mice Trisomy 100 acc. Hypothesis The features have no impact on the target There isn t enough rows in the dataset need more people The dataset isn t representative of the population As we undersampled the dataset we only have 66 2 rows in the end. Breast Cancer Data Analysis Prediction at the end OverviewBreast cancer is cancer that forms in the cells of the breasts. com dorianvoydie vaccine covid 19 indicators Classes d\u00e9s\u00e9quilibr\u00e9es Class count Divide by class Class count Divide by class Resampling calculating the probabilities finding the predicted valued calculating the probabilities Finding the predicted valued Importing the Keras libraries and packages Initialising the ANN Adding the input layer and the first hidden layer Adding the second hidden layer Adding the third hidden layer Adding the output layer Compiling the ANN. png Despite the advantage of balancing classes these techniques also have their weaknesses there is no free lunch. The simplest implementation of over sampling is to duplicate random records from the minority class which can cause overfitting. com dorianvoydie eda modelling breast cancer detection Weather Forecasting 98 acc. com dorianvoydie eda modelling 95 5 acc mobile price EDA Modelling Stroke 74 acc. com dorianvoydie eda modelling stroke 74 acc EDA Modelling Holiday Package 89 acc.
