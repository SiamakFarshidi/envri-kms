Ridge regression in scikit learn 1 2. The features will be RT_user_norm RT_norm Metacritic_user_norm Metacritic_norm and the response will be IMDB_norm 1 Linear regression with scikit learn The total minimum of chi squared obtained in the regression is much lower than the number of degrees of freedom 45. 1 https fivethirtyeight. If you want to know what a box plot is check out a nice graphical representation of the concept 1. anticorrelation between Fandango and Metacritic although a small number 0. This is the actual average score the movie obtained. 2 Correlation matrix We are going to compute Pearson correlation coefficients and build a full correlation matrix. For example running this by clicking run or pressing Shift Enter will list the files in the input directory from subprocess import check_output print check_output ls. decode utf8 Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output. 4 Scatter plots Let us take a look into how some pairs of variables correlate visually in scatter plots. We notice that the negative correlation outlined in the previous plots is indeed very week between Metacritic and Fandango when restricting the dataset to good movies only. org stable modules linear_model. set_yscale log nonposx clip axes 0. svg 2 Fandango s Ratings Are Inflated By Rounding Conclusion Fandango is not only biased toward greater stars it overrates due to rounding. Answer Fandango becomes even more biased and also highly skewed to the right median 4. Let s try it without Fandango_Stars. The tensorflow result looks almost identical to the one obtained with scikit learn. html 3 Correlation matrix for RT best movies only The correlations decreased when only considering movies for which RT rating is greater or equal to 4 stars. set_yscale log nonposy clip. 2 Linear regression with TensorFlow Reference Linear Regression in Tensorflow tutorial 1 1 http aqibsaeed. Pearson correlation coefficient from Wikipedia 1 2. RT_norm The Rotten Tomatoes Tomatometer score for the film normalized to a 0 to 5 point system RT_user_norm The Rotten Tomatoes user score for the film normalized to a 0 to 5 point system Metacritic_norm The Metacritic critic score for the film normalized to a 0 to 5 point system Metacritic_user_nom The Metacritic user score for the film normalized to a 0 to 5 point system IMDB_norm The IMDb user score for the film normalized to a 0 to 5 point system RT_norm_round The Rotten Tomatoes Tomatometer score for the film normalized to a 0 to 5 point system and rounded to the nearest half star RT_user_norm_round The Rotten Tomatoes user score for the film normalized to a 0 to 5 point system and rounded to the nearest half star Metacritic_norm_round The Metacritic critic score for the film normalized to a 0 to 5 point system and rounded to the nearest half star Metacritic_user_norm_round The Metacritic user score for the film normalized to a 0 to 5 point system and rounded to the nearest half star IMDB_norm_round The IMDb user score for the film normalized to a 0 to 5 point system and rounded to the nearest half star Metacritic_user_vote_count The number of user votes the film had on Metacritic IMDB_user_vote_count The number of user votes the film had on IMDb Fandango_votes The number of user votes the film had on Fandango Fandango_Difference The difference between the presented Fandango_Stars and the actual Fandango_Ratingvalue Preamble Read data Reviewing FiveThirtyEight s analysis 1 Fandango s Lopsided Ratings Curve As we see from the above box plots Fandango Fandango_Stars and IMDB IMDB_norm normalized to 5 stars seems to be biased towards ratings above 3 stars. svg media File Boxplot_vs_PDF. In the scatter plots above gray colors correspond to the points from the full dataset and red colors the points for which RT ratings are greater or equal to 4 stars. com nfmcclure tensorflow_cookbook blob master 03_Linear_Regression 06_Implementing_Lasso_and_Ridge_Regression 06_lasso_and_ridge_regression. com features fandango movies ratings Column Definition FILM The film in question RottenTomatoes The Rotten Tomatoes Tomatometer score for the film RottenTomatoes_User The Rotten Tomatoes user score for the film Metacritic The Metacritic critic score for the film Metacritic_User The Metacritic user score for the film IMDB The IMDb user score for the film Fandango_Stars The number of stars the film had on its Fandango movie page Fandango_Ratingvalue The Fandango ratingValue for the film as pulled from the HTML of each page. Going beyond FiveThrityEight analysis 1 Best movies only Restrict the analysis to the best movies only let us say a Rotten Tomatoes critic rating of 4 stars and beyond. The data from Fandango was pulled on Aug. Data behind the story Be Suspicious Of Online Movie Ratings Especially Fandango s 1 fandango_score_comparison. org wiki Pearson_correlation_coefficient 2 http mathworld. Furthermore the rating systems Metacritic and IMDB seems to be more compatible than before concerning their spread. io 2016 07 07 TensorflowLR 3 https github. 1 https commons. It would give a great linear regression solution except for the fact that the sample is pretty small. Linear and ridge regressions have converged to the same results in TensorFlow. Input data files are available in the. csv contains every film that has a Rotten Tomatoes rating a RT User rating a Metacritic score a Metacritic User score and IMDb score and at least 30 fan reviews on Fandango. Correlation Coefficient from Wolfram MathWorld 2 1 https en. Lasso and ridge regression in TensorFlow Cookbook 3 1 http scikit learn. com CorrelationCoefficient. Moreover Fandango became so much biased toward high ratings that Metacritic is tending to follow the opposite direction anticorrelated although very weakly. This translates into a p value approximately equals 1 which is a very good fit. What does it mean For good movies according to RT the rating systems agree less. 3 Ridge regression with TensorFlow References 1. pyThe ridge regression converges much faster less iterations for the same learning rate. Machine learning Hey Most of the scatter plots in 4 look pretty linear to me. Linear Regression in Tensorflow tutorial 2 3. html ridge regression 2 http aqibsaeed.
