Homogeneous transformation matrix from sensor coordinate frame to ego car frame. This technology is used to create 3D representations in many real world scenarios. The onboard source of illumination makes Flash lidar an active sensor. map Map data that is stored as binary semantic masks from a top down view. This signifies that small objects in general have greater center_y values than large objects. After diving into the theory behind these concepts I will show how this dataset can be packaged into a compact format which makes it easier to query information from the dataset. com gaborfodor eda 3d object detection challenge Lyft EDA Animations generating CSVs by xhulu https www. And on the other hand larger objects like cars trucks and buses tend to have a greater height with respect to the camera. The distributions for the small objects have much greater probability density concentrated at lower values of center_z as compared to large objects. The signal that is returned is processed by embedded algorithms to produce a nearly instantaneous 3D rendering of objects and terrain features within the field of view of the sensor. Licensed under the Creative Commons see licence. Each image simply consists of three color channels Red R Blue B and Green G that form the RGB color image format. This causes the center_y to be greater on average for small objects as compared to large objects. We can extract and look at the first scence as follows As it can be seen above each scence consists of a dictionary of information. class_nameIn the plots below I will explore how the distribution of center_z changes for different object class_names. height height is simply the height of the bounding volume in which the object lies. Therefore the mean center_x is clearly greater for larger vehicles like buses and trucks. This signifies that small objects in general have smaller center_y values than large objects. The Flash LiDAR uses a single light source that illuminates the field of view in a single pulse. But smaller objects like bicycles and pedestrians cannot remain in the field of view of the camera when they are too close. Reset for future plots. Acknowledgements NuScences DevKit by Lyft https github. This coordinate represents the height of the object above the x y plane. This is not surprising because trucks buses and cars almost always have much greater width than pedestrians and bicycles. This comprehensive 3D map provides the car with detailed information so that it can navigate even in complex environments. Initialize LyftDatasetExplorer class Store the mapping from token to table index for each table. txt Modified by Vladimir Iglovikov 2019. The majority of the objects are cars as we will see later and these constitute a length of around 2 at the peak. Finally LiDAR can also be used to render high quality 3D maps of ocean floors and other inaccesible terrains making it very useful to geologists and oceanographers. These coordinates represent the location of an object on the x y plane. But the distribution of center_y purple has a signficantly higher skew that the the distribution of center_x orange. Now a special device called a Flash LiDAR Camera is used to create 3D maps using the information from these sensors. The laser beams reflect off the objects in their path and the reflected beams are collected by a sensor. Distribution of center_z In the above diagram we can see that the distribution of center_z has an extremely high positive rightward skew and is clustered around the 20 mark which is approximates its mean value. In the violin plots above we can see that the distributions of center_z for small objects including pedestrians and bicycles have a significantly smaller mean value than large objects like trucks and buses. Load and render Store here so we don t render the same image twice. For each sample in the scene store the ego pose. This is how humans sense the world around us. Decode each point. sensor A specific sensor type. It motivates me to produce more quality content Taken from https www. This process is similar to actual human vision. Decorate adds short cut sample_annotation table with for category name. This is probably because the large vehicles tend to be within the field of view of the camera due to their large size. One of the peaks is around 0. Now let us extract the first sample sample from the first scence. com xhlulu lyft eda animations generating csvs if you find this interesting. Load up the pointcloud. Two eyes make observations in 2D and these two pieces of information are combined to form a 3D map depth perception. RGB Colour maps Monochrome maps Set the colors for the mask. By immediately returning a 3D elevation mesh of target landscapes a flash sensor can be used by an autonomous vehicle to make decisions regarding speed adjustment braking steering etc. The presence of the two peaks at symmetric positions reduces the skew in both directions and they cancel out making the distribution more balanced than the distributions of center_x center_y and center_z. The name matches with the name of the LiDAR data file associated with the given scene. Relationship between center_x and center_y KDE PlotIn the KDE plot above we can see that center_x and center_y seem to have a somewhat negative correlation. The time required for the light to reflect back to the sensor is calculated. if ESC is pressed exit Get logs by location Filter scenes Get records from the database. The image data is in the usual. Now since it is clear what LiDAR is and how it works we can get right to visualizing the dataset. What is LiDAR LiDAR Light Detection and Ranging is a method used to generate accurate 3D representations of the surroundings and it uses laser light to achieve this. In the violin plots we can clearly see that the width distributions for large vehicles like cars buses and trucks have much larger means as compared to small objects like pedestrians and bicycles. Poses are associated with the sample_data. And finally I will show how to visualize and explore this data using plots and graphs in matplotlib. And it can also detect objects that are far to side but not too far ahead. class_nameIn the plots below I will explore how the distribution of center_y changes for different object class_names. log Log information from which the data was extracted. Each snapshot in the data consists of two forms of information image data and LiDAR data. They barely have any skew and have greater means than the distributions for pedestrians and bicycles. Basically the higher the wavelength of the color of the contour line the greater the distance of the object from the camera. Please upvote xhulu s kernel https www. Frequency of object classesFrom the above diagram it can be seen that the most common object class in the dataset is car. Because of this objects that are far ahead and far to the side are not detected at all and only objects which satisfy one or none of those conditions are detected. The height distributions for smaller objects like pedestrians and bicycles have much smaller mean and quartile values as compared to larger objects like cars trucks and buses. These color channels superimpose to form the final colored image. Convention x points forward y to the left z up. class_nameIn the plots below I will explore how the distribution of length changes for different object class_names. there are two mmajor peaks in the distribution. They usually cross the road during a red traffic signal when the traffic halts. Explicitly assign tables to help the IDE determine valid class members. class_nameIn the plots below I will explore how the distribution of width changes for different object class_names. These images can therefore be stored in a four dimensional tensor with dimensions as batch_size channels width height. sample_annotation An annotated instance of an object within our interest. Each pixel records the time it takes each laser pulse to hit the target and return to the sensor as well as the depth location and reflective intensity of the object being contacted by the laser pulse. The majority of the objects are cars as we will see later and these constitute a width of around 2 at the peak. Initialize map mask for each map record. Filter by ambig_state. Maps instance tokens to prev_ann records There are rare situations where the timestamps in the DB are off so ensure that t0 current_time. In the diagram above we can see that the width is approximately normally distirbuted with a mean of around 2 with some outliers on either side. Below is a video featuring a drone equipped with LiDAR. Therefore most pedestrains and bicycles that are detected tend to be far away. All the other object classes are nowhere near cars in terms of frequency. Therefore the height or z coordinate of the objects relative to the camera are generally negative. Filter by dynProp. list_sample my_sample token Next let us render a pointcloud for a sample image in the dataset. This is not surprising because trucks buses and cars almost always have much greater length than pedestrians and bicycles. com gaborfodor eda 3d object detection challenge Lyft Dataset SDK dev kit. But since the length of the road is much greater than its width and there is a higher chance of the camera s view being blocked from this angle the camera can only find objects narrowly ahead or narrowly behind and not further away. Make list of Box objects including coord system transforms. 3D bounding box corners. Add reverse indices from log records to map records. The center_x distribution is more evenly spread out. Fuse four transformation matrices into one and perform transform. Distribution of yaw In the diagram above we can see that the distribution of yaw is roughly bimodal i. If space is pressed pause. And the most common vehicle or entity for that matter visible on those roads are cars. sample A snapshot of a scence at a particular instance in time. This gives an accurate idea of the 3D shape of the artifact when the artifact cannot be excavated for whatever reason. if space is pressed pause. Lookup table for how to decode the binaries. This is probably because most objects are very close to the flat plane of the road and therefore there is no great variation in the height of the objects above or below the camera. Filter points with an invalid state. It automatically creates a 3D map of the world around it using the process mentioned above. positive difference Merge with key pc. com xhlulu lyft eda animations generating csvs Lidar Wikipedia https en. center_z center_z corresponds to the xz coordinate of the center of an object s location bounding volume. So most of the times the camera has to look down to see the objects. The high frame rate of the sensor makes it a useful tool for a variety of applications that benefit from real time visualization such as autonomous vehicle driving. Contrastingly the smaller objects like pedestrians and bicycles have center_x distributions with strong positive rightward skews. instance An enumeration of all object instance we observed. Calculate the pose on the map and append Compute number of close ego poses. Both distributions also have a clear rightward or positive skew. The outliers on the right represent larger objecs like trucks and vans and the outliers on the left represent smaller objects like pedestrians and bicycles. Animate image data for 3 scences Scence 1 Scence 2 Scence 3 Animate LiDAR data for 3 scences Scence 1 Scence 2 Scence 3 Ending noteThis brings me to the end of this kernel. I will explain how LiDAR data is collected and stored and then I will talk about the intuition behind this data format. I will also use install the chart_studio library to generate interactive plots. In the violin plots we can clearly see that the length distributions for large vehicles like buses and trucks have much larger means as compared to small objects like pedestrians and bicycles. Init Get reference pose and timestamp Homogeneous transform from ego car frame to reference frame Homogeneous transformation matrix from global to _current_ ego car frame Aggregate current and previous sweeps. Here we use the lidar sample_data. This technology is also used in archaeology. A moving robot uses LiDAR to to create a 3D map of its surroundings and using this map it avoids obstacles and completes its tasks. Make reverse indexes for common lookups. This is probably because these large vehicles tend to keep greater distances from the other vehicles and the smaller vehicles do not stay too close to these large vehicles in order to avoid accidents. Distributions of center_x and center_y In the diagram above the purple distribution is that of center_y and the orange distribution is that of center_x. class_nameIn the plots below I will explore how the distribution of center_x changes for different object class_names. 5 and the other is around 2. Therefore each scence is made up of several samples. Basically laser beams are shot in all directions by a laser. A NaN in the first point indicates an empty pointcloud. For example it is used in farms to help sow seeds and remove weeds. Retrieve sensor pose records Retrieve all sample annotations and map to sensor coordinate system. This is probably because the car s camera can sense objects on either left or right easily along the x axis due to the width of the road being small. Also most z coordinates are negative because the camera is attached at the top of the car. It motivates me to produce more quality content A self driving car in action Before we dive into the technical details of this kernel let us watch an interesting video of a self driving car in action It can be seen in the video that the car is able to effortlessly take turns change lanes stop at red lights etc. The center_y distributions for smaller objects like pedestrians and bicycles have much larger mean and quartile values as compared to larger objects like cars trucks and buses. The camera can detect objects that are far ahead but not too far to the side. This depth information combined with the 2D represenation of the image provides an accurate 3D representation of the object. Define the path containing the dataset Load the training dataframe Group data by object category Convert numerical features from str to float32 First ExplorationNow I will explore the data in this particular dataframe and see if I can derive any useful insights from it. This is probably because pedestrians road crossers and bicyclists do not need to maintain large distances with cars and trucks to avoid accidents. This difference in time calculated by the sensors can be used to calculate the depth of the object. In the violin plots we can clearly see that the length distributions for large vehicles like cars buses and trucks have much larger means as compared to small objects like pedestrians and bicycles. type List int Get the header rows and check if they appear as expected. Move box to ego vehicle coord system parallel to world z plane Move box to ego vehicle coord system Move box to sensor coord system Retrieve sensor pose records If no previous annotations available or if sample_data is keyframe just return the current ones. The yellow boxes around the objects in the images are the bounding boxes or bounding volumes that show the location of the objects in the image. From the diagram above we can see that the distributions of both center_x and center_y have multiple peaks and are therefore multimodal. Here the LiDAR file s name is host a101 lidar0 1241893239199111666 1241893264098084346. Decorate adds short cut sample_data with sensor information. In the diagram above we can see that the height has a distribution with a strong positive rightward skew with a mean of around 2 with some outliers on either side. In the violin plots above we can see that the distributions of center_y for small objects including pedestrians and bicycles have a greater mean value than large objects like trucks and buses. The pointcloud is basically a set of contours that represent the distance of various objects as measured by the LiDAR. width width is simply the width of the bounding volume in which the object lies. Create a function to render scences in the dataset Render the first scence image and LiDAR Render the second scence image and LiDAR These images above display the image and LiDAR data collected using the cameras and sensors from various angles on the car. The colours of these contour lines represent the distance. The center_z distributions for smaller objects like pedestrians and bicycles have much smaller mean and quartile values as compared to larger objects like cars trucks and buses. calibrated sensor Definition of a particular sensor as calibrated on a particular vehicle. Note You can list all the scenes in the dataset using lyft_dataset. length length is simply the length of the bounding volume in which the object lies. Just like a camera that takes pictures of distance instead of colors. jpeg format which is fairly simple to understand. Below is a 3D map of an ocean floor generated using LiDAR And of course self driving cars use this technology to identify objects around them in 3D dimensions along with estimating the velocities and orientations of these objects. Wait a very short time 1 ms. How does LiDAR work The above GIF roughly demonstrates how LiDAR works. Show updated canvas. The dataset structure1. This is not surprising because trucks and buses almost always have much greater length than pedestrians and bicycles. If you did find this kernel interesting please drop an upvote. Convert to numpy matrix. org wiki Lidar If you find this kernel interesting please drop an upvote. One can estimate that the mean is between 1 and 2 around 1. This type of camera is attached to the top of autonomous cars and these cars use this to navigate while driving. They tend to have a similar height to that of pedestrians. Each scence is composed of many samples. I hope you found this kernel useful or interesting. yaw yaw is the angle of the volume around the z axis making yaw the direction the front of the vehicle bounding box is pointing at while on the ground. There are a few token IDs and a name for each scene. type List int type List int Use 0 2 6 for moving objects only. center_x and center_y center_x and center_y correspond to the x and y coordinates of the center of an object s location bounding volume. Visualizing the data Install lyft_dataset_sdk and import the necessary librariesWe will need the lyft_dataset_sdk library because it will help us visualize the image and LiDAR data easily. Get annotations and params from DB. This is possible because the car is able to accurately recognize objects in 3D space using information from it s sensors such as image and LiDAR data. Remove close points and add timevector. com xhlulu s brilliant animation kernel https www. Class level settings for radar pointclouds see from_file. The only exception to this trend are the cars. attribute Property of an instance that can change while the category remains the same. The laser pulse repetition frequency is sufficient for generating 3D videos with high resolution and accuracy. This is probably once again due to the limitations of the camera system. Code written by Oscar Beijbom 2018. Flash LiDAR CameraThe device featured in the image above is called a Flash LiDAR Camera. list_scenes Now let us visualize some of the image and LiDAR data. Basically the 3D target is illuminated with a laser light a focused directed beam of light and the reflected light is collected by sensors. The distribution does not have any clear skew. Basically the LiDAR uses light beams to measure the distance of various objects as discussed earlier and this distance information can be visualized as a set of 3D contours. The majority of the objects are cars as we will see later and these constitute a length of around 5 at the peak. The darker purple and blue contour lines represent the closer objects and the lighter green and yellow lines represent the far away objects. sample_data Contains the data collected from a particular sensor on the car. Different sensors collect light from different parts of the object and the times recorded by the sensors would be different. ego_pose Ego vehicle poses at a particular timestamp. Reverse index samples with sample_data and annotations. This indicates that objects are spread out very evenly along the x axis but not likewise along the y axis. The variation spread of center_z is significantly smaller than that of center_x and center_y. The distributions for the small objects have much greater probability density concentrated at higher values of center_y as compared to large objects. Only a simple pip install command is required. Introduction In this kernel I will be explaining the meaning and intuition behind each component in the dataset including the images LiDAR and pointclouds. Now I will import the other libraries necessary to carry out the exploration. This is unsurprising because the images are taken from the streets of Palo Alto in Silicon Valley California. There is understandably much greater variation in the x and y coordiantes of the object. Each sample is annoted with the objects present. In the box plots above we can notice the same observation as in the violin plot above. The length distributions for smaller objects like pedestrians and bicycles have much smaller mean and quartile values as compared to larger objects like cars trucks and buses. In the violin plots above we can see that the distributions of center_x for large vehicles including trucks buses and other vehicles are well spread. LiDAR is used to create 3D renderings of 2D scans of artifacts. Digging into the image and LiDAR data Define some functions to help create the LyftDataset class click CODE on the right side Create a class called LyftDataset to package the dataset in a convenient form click CODE on the right side Create another class called LyftDatasetExplorer which will help us to visualize the data click CODE on the right side Create a LyftDataset object from the existing datasetThe dataset consists of several scences which are 25 45 second clips of image of LiDAR data from a self driving car. Note You can list all samples in a scence using lyft_dataset. These distributions also have clearly lower means than the distributions for the larger vehicles. This results in a negative relationship between center_x and center_y. Note that a sample is a snapshot of the data at a given point in time during the scene. Now add to canvas Only update canvas if we have not already rendered this one. category Taxonomy of object categories e. Once again the only exception to this trend are the cars. if ESC is pressed exit. visibility currently not used 9. I use functions from that kernel to animate the image and LiDAR data. So I will now look at what these forms of data mean theoretically and then I will visualize this information later in the kernel. The focal plane of a Flash LiDAR camera has rows and columns of pixels with ample depth and intensity to create 3D landscape models. scene Consists of 25 45 seconds of a car s journey in a given environment. Now I will move on to the LiDAR data which fewer people might be familiar with. com xhlulu lyft eda animations generating csvs. Abort if there are no previous sweeps. class_nameIn the plots below I will explore how the distribution of height changes for different object class_names. This is probably because smaller objects like pedestrians and bicycles tend to have a lower height with repsect to the camera. If no parameters are provided use default settings. Rotate Translate Draw the sides Draw front first 4 corners and rear last 4 corners rectangles 3d lines 2d Draw line indicating the front Draw the sides Draw front first 4 corners and rear last 4 corners rectangles 3d lines 2d Draw line indicating the front Lyft Dataset SDK dev kit. com lyft nuscenes devkit EDA 3D Object Detection Challenge by beluga https www. But the camera cannot detect objects that are both far ahead and far to the side. The width distributions for smaller objects like pedestrians and bicycles have much smaller mean and quartile values as compared to larger objects like cars trucks and buses. Get records from DB Open CV init Get data from DB Load and render Render Images stored at approx 10 Hz so wait 10 ms. We can also print all annotations across all sample data for a given sample as shown below We can also render the image data from particular sensors as follows Front CameraImages from the front camera Back CameraImages from the back camera Front Left CameraImages from the front left camera Front Right CameraImages from the front right camera Back Left CameraImages from the back left camera Back Right CameraImages from the back right cameraWe can pick a given annotation from a sample in the data and render only that annotation as shown below We can also pick a given instance from the dataset and render only that instance as shown below We can also get the LiDAR data collected from various LIDAR sensors on the car as follows Top LiDAR LiDAR data from the top sensor Front Left LiDAR LiDAR data from the front left sensor Front Right LiDAR LiDAR data from the front right sensor Image and LiDAR animationThis section is from xhulu https www. In the diagram above we can see that the length has a distribution with a strong positive rightward skew with a mean of around 5 with some outliers on either side.
