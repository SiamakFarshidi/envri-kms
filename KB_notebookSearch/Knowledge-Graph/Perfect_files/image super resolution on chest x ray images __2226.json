The model weights that are considered the best are loaded into the model. Visualize input images after processing them. Here authors have proposed sub pixel convolution layer which learns an array of upscaling filters to upscale the final Low Resolution feature maps into the High Resolution output. Create a new figure with a default 111 subplot. Define image data generators to load and preprocess the images Normalize the pixels for training and validation images Here we have prepared a dataset of test image paths that we will use for visual evaluation at the end of this example. Now we run the model prediction and plot the results Import all the necessary libraries Scale from 0 255 to 0 1 Use TF Ops to process. And we will also look into target images Define Our CNN Model Architecture Here we have defined some utility functions to monitor our results1. For the target data high resolution images we just crop the image and retrieve the y channel. We only consider the luminance channel in the YUV color space because humans are more sensitive to luminance change. upscale_image to turn a low resolution image to a high resolution version reconstructed by the model. First we convert our images from the RGB color space to the YUV colour space. Restore the image in RGB color space. pdf paper on medical chest X ray images. The ESPCNCallback object will compute and display the PSNR metric. Store PSNR value in each epoch. This is the main metric we use to evaluate super resolution performance. Here we define functions to process the input images. Here we have defined callbacks to monitor training1. In this function we use the y channel from the YUV color space as input to the model and then combine the output with the other channels to obtain an RGB image. This effectively helps to eliminate bicubic filter in the Super Resolution pipeline with more complex upscaling filters specifically trained for each feature map whilst also reducing the computational complexity of the overall Super Resolution operation. We take input data low resolution images we crop the image retrieve the y channel luninance and resize it.
