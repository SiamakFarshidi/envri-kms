This figure is a bit confusing it implies that the disc detectors have four elements in each layer. com kaggle docker python For example here s several helpful packages to load in linear algebra data processing CSV file I O e. read_csv Input data files are available in the. The layers of all volumes are labelled from the inside out volume 9 has its first layer 2 at z 600 mm its last layer 14 at z 1500 mm Similar labelling is used for the barrel detectors. As stated by the organizers. Coordinates are in mm and momentum in MeV cThe two functions defined above allow for a bit more detailed view of the detector plot_volume allows you to select the volume id and you can displays two views transverse yx and longitudinal yz With plot_volume_and_layer you can include the layer_id in your choice. show the volume_id The layer ids listed in this dataset are. This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed It is defined by the kaggle python docker image https github. The display is also possible in two views. Or this could be an artifact of the hit coordinate algorithm. From this first look at the data it is clear that even though the hits appear to be listed by volume_id and layer_id all memory of the tracks has been removed from the data set.
