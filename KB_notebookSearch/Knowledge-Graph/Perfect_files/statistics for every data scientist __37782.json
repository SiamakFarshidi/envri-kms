Divide by the number of samples observed. Data could be non parametric for many reasons such as Data is not real valued but instead is ordinal intervals or some other form. Higher the loading value higher is the correlation. In a coin toss suppose Head comes 60 100 times N 100 P Head 60 100 succes np. Example The number of emergency calls recorded at a hospital in a day. Correlation Pearson s CorrelationBoth Covariance and Correlation measures the relationship and the dependency between two variables. This is a useful shorthand but strictly this is not entirely accurate. Accept or Reject the Null Hypothesis. qsec gear and am have a significant contribution to PC2. It is the average of the squared distances from each point to the mean. 8181 Male No 178 172 0. 5 the distribution is skewed towards the right side. In a Probability Distribution graph we have the range of values on the x axis and the frequency of occurrences of different values on the y axis. SE bar x frac sigma_x sqrt n Confidence IntervalsA Confidence Interval is a range of values we are fairly sure our true value eg. mean or median is statistically significant. Cov \ud835\udc4b \ud835\udc4c frac sum x_i bar x y_i bar y N 1 Cov \ud835\udc4b \ud835\udc4b Var \ud835\udc4b Cov \ud835\udc4b \ud835\udc4c Cov \ud835\udc4c \ud835\udc4b The use of the mean in the calculation suggests the need for each data sample to have a Gaussian or Gaussian like distribution. In general the findings from nonparametric methods are less powerful than their parametric counterparts namely because they must be generalized to work for all types of data. This suggests a high level of correlation. Probability density function PDF is used to determine the probability distribution for a Continuous Random Variable. The component loading can be represented as the correlation of a particular variable on the respective PC principal component. As a conclusion not a lot of significant insights can be driven from the Principal Component Analysis on the basis of the covariance matrix. Student s t test compares the means of two independent groups in order to determine if the two population means are equal. In the case of real valued data that does not fit the familiar Gaussian distribution or ordinal data or interval data nonparametric statistics are the only type of statistics that can be used. We expect the statistical tests to discover that the samples were drawn from differing distributions. When the standard error increases i. Standard ErrorThe standard error of the mean also called the standard deviation of the mean tells us how accurate the mean of any given sample from that population is likely to be compared to the true population mean. It can assume both positive or negative. The first principal component here on the left and right corresponds to the measure of disp and hp. Let s remove this variable from the model. Steps to perform the Chi Square Test Define Hypothesis. This way if for instance a variable Y is uniform in 1 2 3 there d be 33 chance for each of those values to be assigned to Y. 100 accuracy is not possible for accepting or rejecting a hypothesis so we therefore select a level of significance that is usually 5 which means the output should be 95 confident to give similar kind of result in each sample. The t distribution has been used as a reference for the distribution of a sample mean the difference between two sample means regression parameters and other statistics. Contingency table Gender Exited Yes No Total Male 38 178 216 Female 44 140 184 Total 82 318 400 Degrees of freedom for contingency table is given as r 1 c 1 where r c are rows and columns. With the help of p value we not only made a simpler model with fewer variables but we also improved the model s performance. The center and scale provide the respective means and standard deviation of the variables that were used for normalization before implementing PCA. We choose the significance level before we perform the experiment. The most important thing to note in this model summary is that although we have reduced two independent variables the value of the adjusted R Square is increased. Standard Normal distribution When we standardize a random variable its mean becomes 0 and its standard deviation becomes 1. 2465 Chi Square Value 2. Selection of predictors and independent variables is one prominent application of such exercises. With this information we can easily interpret the key variable in the PC. 68 of the data falls within the first standard deviation from the mean. The 95 Confidence Interval is 175cm 6. Build a Contingency table. This result is often against the alternate hypothesis obtained results are from another distribution. It assume that the two or more random variables are normally distributed. generate gaussian data samples generate two sets of univariate observations summarize interpret interpret interpret interpret rpy2 runs embedded R in a Python process. text Chi Square sum frac O_i E_i 2 E_i text O Observed values E Expected Values In feature selection we aim to select the features which are highly dependent on the response y. It assume that the two random variables are normally distributed. Corr_ xy frac Cov \ud835\udc4b \ud835\udc4c sigma_x sigma_y Types of correlations Positive Correlation both variables change in the same direction. Anderson Darling Test Test the null hypothesis that the data is drawn from a particular distribution. The value of correlation is not influenced by the change in scale of the values. The strategy is to determine if the values from the two samples are randomly mixed in the rank ordering or if they are clustered at opposite ends when combined. It is the square root of variance. We can finish this analysis with a summary of the PCA with the covariance matrix From this table we see that the maximum contribution to variation caused is caused by PC1 92. Data Ranking Before a nonparametric statistical method can be applied the data must be converted into a rank format. The life of an Air Conditioner. Alternate Hypothesis The independent variables have a significant effect on the target variable. bar x frac sum x_i n Median List the values of the data set in numerical order ascending descending and identify which value appears in the middle of the list. It is a way to describe the center of a data set. 05 we accept the null hypothesis. This means that we already know the distribution and we know its parameters. p value alpha The pink point has a p value less than the alpha value red. Variance Variance measures how far a set of data is spread out. QQ Plot A QQ Plot is used to visually determine how close a sample is to the normal distribution. This in turn affects the importance of the variables computed for any further analyses. p value is the cumulative probability area under the curve of the values right of the green line in the figure above. A random rank order would mean that the two samples are not different while a cluster of one sample values would indicate a difference between them. 8 of success is greater than 0. If we move away from the peak the occurrence of the values decreases rapidly and so does the corresponding probability towards a very small value close to zero. Instead of calculating the coefficient using covariance and standard deviations on the samples themselves Spearman s Correlation is calculated from the relative rank of values on each sample. We will also see how PCA results differ when computed with the correlation matrix and the covariance matrix respectively. Pearson Correlation Coefficient is not robust to outliers Presence of outliers will always impace Pearson Correlation Coefficient value. Calculate the Chi Square statistic. A hypothesis test evaluates two mutually exclusive statements about a population to determine which statement is best supported by the sample data. Often parametric is shorthand for real valued data drawn from a Gaussian distribution. The scale measure is set as FALSE as specified by in the input arguments. The second principal component PC2 does not seem to have a strong measure. Remarks Although a low p value promotes the rejection of the null hypothesis it addresses nothing about the probability of rejecting it. This analysis with the correlation matrix definitely uncovers some better structure in the data and relationships between variables. The parameters of a binomial distribution are N and P where N is the total number of trials and P is the probability of success in each trial. Exponential Distribution Exponential Distribution measures the distribution of the time between events. These outcomes are labeled as Success and Failure. Non Parametric Data Parametric Data Parametric data is a sample of data drawn from a known data distribution. Data Ranking is exactly as its name suggests. 5 indicates a notable correlation and values below those values suggests a less notable correlation. A distribution is called Poisson distribution when the following assumptions are valid 1. text Median frac n 1 2 Mode Value in the data set which occurs most often. If the p value satisfies our level of significance p alpha only then can we make conclusions. An example is Logistic Regression or Linear Regression. Importantly the test can only comment on whether all samples are the same or not it cannot quantify which samples differ or by how much. If the points roughly fall on the diagonal line then the sample distribution can be considered close to normal. Or p value corresponding to the green point point of intersection of green line and the curve tells us about the total probability of getting any value to the right hand side of the green line when the values are picked randomly from the population distribution. Data is real valued but does not fit a well understood shape. Example a company production is 50 unit per day. It has dropped from 92. Examples of paired samples in machine learning might be the same algorithm evaluated on different datasets or different algorithms evaluated on exactly the same training and test data. The degree of freedom here is 2. The probabilities of success and failure need not be equally likely. Given the data of two variables we can get observed count O and expected count E. compare the performance of a worker by comparing the average sales done by him with the standard value. The Kruskal Wallis test is a nonparametric version of the one way analysis of ANOVA. 5 Different Probability Probability of me winning with superman 0. Alpha value Significance LevelAlpha value Significance Level generally 0. The number of customers arriving at a salon in an hour. In simpler terms it means that almost 93 of the variance in the data set can be explained using the first principal component with measures of disp and hp. sigma sqrt sigma 2 Covariance Covariance is a measure of how change in one variable is associated with change in a second variable. If we have parametric data we can use parametric methods and can harness the entire suite of statistical methods developed for data assuming a Gaussian distribution such as Summary statistics. The above example can be used to conclude that the results significantly differ when one tries to define variable relationships using covariance and correlation. Find the Expected Value Based on the null hypothesis that the two variables are independent. In the scipy documents https docs. 7 fall within three standard deviations. Student s T Distribution T Distribution or Student s T Distribution is a probability distribution that is used to estimate population parameters when the sample size is small 30. We will see R code how Covariance and Correlation Matrix can be used to explain which features contributes to maximum variance in PCA analysis. The values from PCA done using the correlation matrix are closer to each other and more uniform as compared to the analysis done using the covariance matrix. A high p value means that our data is highly consistent with our null hypothesis nothing more. 7 and all other principal components have progressively lower contribution. In a set of 3 numbers with the mean as 10 and two out of three variables as 5 and 15 there is only one possibility of the value that the third number can take up i. Covariance and Correlation Statistical Analysis in PCA In PCA analysis use the covariance matrix when the variable are on similar scales and the correlation matrix when the scales of the variables differ. The number of printing errors at each page of the book. text Spearman s Correlation Coefficient frac Covariance rank x rank y stdv rank x stdv rank y Chi Squared Test Chi Square Test is used in statistics to test whether two non negative features boolean category non negative numbers are related or independent. A discrete uniform distribution will take a finite set of values S and assign a probability of 1 n to each of them where n is the amount of elements in S. Here df 2 1 2 1 1. The closer T is to 0 the more likely there isn t a significant difference. Negative Correlation variables change in opposite directions. mean standard deviation mean standard deviation mean standard deviation size number of times to repeat the trials. If the evidence suggests that this is not the case the null hypothesis is rejected and at least one data sample has a different distribution. Whereas the Probability Mass Function PMF is used to determine the probability distribution for a Discrete Random Variable. Probability DistributionsIn statistics when we use the term Distribution it usually means Probability distribution. An experiment with only two possible outcomes repeated n number of times is called binomial. ttest is the calculated difference of the population mean represented in units of standard error. Define Hypothesis Null Hypothesis H0 Two variables are independent. When we divide the covariance values by the standard deviation it scales the value down to a limited range of 1 to 1 that represents the limits of correlation from a full negative correlation to a full positive correlation. Level of significance Refers to the degree of significance in which we accept or reject the null hypothesis. Univariate Statistical Analysis Normality Tests Statistical tests to check if the data has a Gaussian distribution. Example Average Height We measure the heights of 40 randomly chosen men and get a mean height of 175cm We also know the standard deviation of men s heights is 20cm. Z is known as the z score. Calculate the standard deviation of all the means. If the Z score of x is zero then the value of x is equal to the mean. Spearman s Correlation can also be used if there is a linear relationship between the variables but may result in lower coefficient scores. The number of suicides reported in a particular city. Non Parametric Data Parametric Data Parametric Data Non Parametric Data Non Parametric Data Univariate Statistical Analysis Univariate Statistical Analysis Normality Tests Normality Tests Shapiro Wilk Test Shapiro Wilk Test D Agostino s K 2 Test D Agostino s K 2 Test Anderson Darling Test Anderson Darling Test Correlation Tests Correlation Tests Covariance Analysis Covariance Analysis Pearson s Correlation Coefficient Pearson s Correlation Coefficient Spearman s Rank Correlation Spearman s Rank Correlation Chi Squared Test Chi Squared Test Parametric Statistical Hypothesis Tests Parametric Statistical Hypothesis Tests Student s t test Student s t test Analysis of Variance Test ANOVA Analysis of Variance Test Nonparametric Statistical Hypothesis Tests Nonparametric Statistical Hypothesis Tests Mann Whitney U Test Mann Whitney U Test Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test Kruskal Wallis H Test Kruskal Wallis H Test Friedman Test Friedman Test Multivariate Statistical Analysis Multivariate Statistical Analysis Covariance and Correlation Statistical Analysis Covariance and Correlation Statistical Analysis Statistical Estimators Central Tendency A measure of central tendency is a single value that describes the way in which a group of data cluster around a central value. The smaller the value of alpha we consider the harder it is to consider the results as significant. Gender Exited Yes No Male 44 172 Female 38 146 Calculate Chi Square value Gender Exited O E frac O E 2 E Male Yes 38 44 0. Term in numerator is called the sum of cross products. 95 fall within two standard deviations. Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test If the the data samples are paired in some way or represent two measurements of the same technique or each sample is independent but comes from the same population we use Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test. Find the expected values. As a result these values can be obtained with fairly high probability. Therefore they are significantly different from the population. text Z frac x mu sigma We use the letter Z to denote standardization. Pearson s Correlation Coefficient Pearson Correlation Coefficient can be used with Continuous variables that have a linear relationship. Each column of the rotation matrix contains the principal component loading vector. In other words it shows the square roots of the eigenvalues. Hypothesis Null Hypothesis The independent variable has no significant effect over the target variable. Neutral Correlation No relationship in the change of the variables. Essentially degrees of freedom is the number of independent data points that went into calculating the estimate. Since Geography has higher the p value it says that the variable is independent of the repsone and may not be considered for model training. Chi Square measures how expected count E and observed count O deviates each other. draw a scatterplot first to check a linear relationship. Two variables being considered may have a non Gaussian distribution. The procedure is as follows Sort all data in the sample in ascending order. If we pick any random value from this distribution the probability that we will pick values close to the mean is highest as it has the highest peak due to high occurrence values in that region. Alternate Hypothesis H1 Two variables are not independent. Covariance indicates the direction of the linear relationship between variables whereas Correlation measures both the magnitude and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. Fatter tails allow for a higher dispersion of variables as there is more uncertainty. PCA with correlation matrix This plot looks more informative. 05 we can discard the null hypothesis. Correlation Tests Covariance Analysis The covariance between the two variables is 389. As with the Pearson correlation coefficient the scores are between 1 and 1 for perfectly negatively correlated variables and perfectly positively correlated respectively. sdev shows the standard deviation of principal components. It is an assumption that we make about the population parameter. It also means that the results are in favor of the null hypothesis and therefore we fail to reject it. The probability of success in an interval approaches zero as the interval becomes smaller. Decision trees and boosted trees algorithms are immune to multicollinearity by nature. Length of time beteeen metro arrivals 2. Non Parametric Data Parametric vs. Stationary Tests Augmented Dickey Fuller Kwiatkowski Phillips Schmidt Shin Parametric Statistical Hypothesis Tests Student s t test A common question about two or more datasets is whether they are same different. the means are more spread out it becomes more likely that any given mean is an inaccurate representation of the true population mean. The matrix x has the principal component score vectors. These data samples are repeated or dependent and are referred to as paired samples or repeated measures. For example the distribution of sum of heights of all men in a region tends towards a Gaussian probability distribution. As a result the sample results are a rare outcome. The QQ Plot orders the z scores from low to high and plots each value s z score on the y axis the x axis is the corresponding quantile of a normal distribution for that value s rank. We can say if A B are two independent events P A land B P A text P B Let s calculate the expected value for the first cell that is those who are Males and are Exited from the bank. Test Dataset Generate two samples drawn from different distributions. When two features are independent the observed count is close to the expected count thus we will have smaller Chi Square value. In this test we will check is there any relationship between Gender and Exited. 2214 Accept or Reject the Null Hypothesis The Chi Square value is greater than alpha 0. Poisson Distribution Poisson random variable is typically used to model the distribution of events per unit of time or space. Alternative hypothesis The alternative hypothesis is the hypothesis that is contrary to the null hypothesis. On the other hand the contribution of PC2 has increased from 7 to 22. The standardized value i. The sign of the covariance shows the tendency in the linear relationship between the variables. Setting the scale FALSE option will use the covariance matrix to get the PCs Setting the scale FALSE option will use the correlation matrix to get the PCs obtain the rootation matrix obtain the biplot correlation matrix method pearson kendall spearman. Another significant difference can be observed if we look at the standard deviation values in both the results above. Let us now look at the principal component loading vectors To help with the interpretation let us plot these results. Length of time between arrivals at a gas station. PCA with covariance matrix prcomp returns 5 key measures sdev rotation center scale and x. Non Parametric Data Data that does not fit a known or well understood distribution is referred to as nonparametric data. Data is almost parametric but contains outliers multiple peaks a shift or some other feature. A higher Chi Square value indicates that the feature is more dependent on the response and can be selected for model training. the null hypothesis is true but is rejected. There are three measures of central tendency the mean the median and the mode. To talk about a null hypothesis being true using a p value is impossible. 9 Each trial is independent since the outcome of the previous toss doesn t determine or affect the outcome of the current toss. With any set of 3 numbers with the same mean for example 12 8 and 10 or say 9 10 and 11 there is only one value for any 2 given values in the set. Or A Probability Distribution is a mathematical function that can be thought of as providing the probabilities of occurrence of different possible outcomes in an experiment. A value of 0 means no correlation. You can basically change the two values here and the third value fixes itself. The two variables are positively correlated and the correlation is 0. Spearman s Rank Correlation Spearman s Correlation is used when Two variables are may be related by a nonlinear relationship such that the relationship is stronger or weaker across the distribution of the variables. Now let s say that the orange and pink points represent different sample results obtained after an experiment. The red point in this distribution represents the alpha value or the threshold p value. 80 85 sigma is the standard deviation n is the number of items in a sample. 1107 44 We also calculated E2 E3 E4 and get the following results. Covariance measures the degree to which two variables are linearly associated. One significant change we see is the drop in the contribution of PC1 to the total variation. sigma 2 frac sum x_i bar x 2 N Standard deviation Standard Deviation measures the absolute variability of a datasets distribution. Variance of zero indicates that all of the data values are identical. Null hypothesis A null hypothesis is a general statement or default position. t frac bar x mu frac sigma sqrt n bar x Sample Mean mu Population Mean sigma standard deviation n sample size Binomial Distribution This type of distribution is used when there are exactly two outcomes of a trial. Since the data is normalized the units correspond to the number of standard deviations away of the data from the mean. It is the equivalent of the paired Student T test but for ranked data instead of real valued data with a Gaussian distribution. As the z statistic is related to the standard Normal distribution the t statistic is related to the Student s T distribution. The variances of the two samples may be assumed to be equal or unequal. The performance of some algorithms can deteriorate if two or more variables are tightly related called multicollinearity. import uniform distribution Decreasing Exponential Function mu The average number of events in an interval. Calaulate the mean of every sample. Most parametric methods have an equivalent nonparametric version. Example a company production is 50 unit per day etc. html Null Hypothesis for ttest_rel is That 2 related or repeated samples have identical average expected values. Nonparametric Statistical Hypothesis Tests The null hypothesis of these tests is often the assumption that both samples were drawn from a population with the same distribution and therefore the same population parameters such as mean or median. We will draw the samples from Gaussian distributions for simplicity although as noted the tests we review are for data samples where we do not know or assume any specific distribution. Furthermore the component loading values show that the relationship between the variables in the data set is way more structured and distributed. Example Consider a data set where we have to determine why customers are leaving the bank. Correlation Matrix for to compare feature correlations Q AQ What is the difference between type I vs type II error A Type I error False Positive when a girl is not pregnant but the doctor has stated that she is pregnant. A Distribution is a function that shows the possible values for a variable and how often they occur. Statistical Estimators Statistical Estimators Central Tendency Central Tendency Mean Mean Median Median Mode Mode Variance Variance Standard deviation Standard deviation Covariance Covariance Correlation Pearson s Correlation Correlation Pearson s Correlation Standard Error Standard Error Probability Distributions Probability Distributions Gausian Normal distribution Gausian Normal distribution Standard Normal distribution Standard Normal distribution Student s T Distribution Student s T Distribution Binomial Distribution Binomial Distribution Bernoulli s Distribution Bernoulli s Distribution Uniform Distribution Uniform Distribution Exponential Distribution Exponential Distribution Poisson Distribution Poisson Distribution Probability Density Function and Probability Mass Function Probability Density Function and Probability Mass Function P value P value Degrees of Freedom Degrees of Freedom Parametric vs. In the above table we have figured out all observed values and our next steps is to find expected values get the Chi Square value and check for relationship. Gausian Normal distribution Normal Distribution is useful because of the Central Limit Theorem CLT which states that when a large number of simple random samples are selected from the population and the mean is calculated for each then the distribution of these sample means will assume the normal probability distribution. D Agostino s K 2 Test Test the null hypothesis that the data is drawn from a normal distribution. The number of thefts reported in an area on a day. Quick Tip Multicollinearity can be handled by 1 Delete one of the perfectly correlated features. The probability of success over a short interval must equal the probability of success over a longer interval. text Confidence interval bar X pm Z frac sigma sqrt n Where bar X is the mean Z is the z value calculated from a table for a confidence interval eg. This says the true mean 95 of times of ALL men population is likely to be between 168. Mann Whitney U Test In Mann Whitney U Test the two samples are combined and rank ordered together. P value Hypothesis testing Hypothesis testing is a statistical method that is used in making statistical decisions using experimental data. It is the distribution of the difference between an estimated parameter and its true or assumed value divided by the standard deviation of the estimated parameter standard error. 05 or 5 is a threshold p value which we decide before conducting a test of similarity or significance Z test or a T test. Applications compare the performance of two workers of by checking the average sales done by each of them. The above results show that Administration has no significant effect over the Profit earned by the startups. The random variable X can take value 1 with the probability of success p and the value 0 with the probability of failure q or 1 p. Shapiro Wilk Test Test the null hypothesis that the data is drawn from a normal distribution. The Friedman test is the nonparametric version of the repeated measures analysis of variance test or repeated measures ANOVA. A large p value implies that sample scores are more aligned or similar to the population score. org doc scipy reference generated scipy. Analysis of Variance Test ANOVA ANOVA is a statistical test that assumes that the mean across 2 or more groups are equal. The samples are not independent therefore the Mann Whitney U test cannot be used. Let us try to look at the summary of this analysis. Student s T distribution looks much like a Normal distribution but generally has fatter tails. ExampleWe can clearly see that Administration has a p value over 0. 2093 Female Yes 44 38 0. Probability Density Function and Probability Mass Function Probability density function and Probability mass function is a statistical expression that defines a Probability Distribution for a random variable. The distribution follows Normal Distribution when the sample size is sufficiently large. Significance tests for comparing means. Same Probability Probability of head in a toss 0. Type II error is opposite of Type I error. The value of covariance is affected by the change in scale of the variables. In general we prefer to work with parametric data and even go so far as to use data preparation methods that make data parametric such as data transforms so that we can harness these well understood statistical methods. Assign an integer rank from 1 to N for each unique value in the data sample. We will use the prcomp function from the stats package. Any successful event should not influence the outcome of another successful event. Bernoulli s Distribution Bernoulli Distribution is a special case of Binomial Distribution with a single trial. Since the probability 0. We can see that it is positive suggesting the variables change in the same direction as we expect. When a Normal Distribution is standardized the result is called a Standard Normal Distribution. E_1 N text P P P yes text P male P frac 82 400 text frac 216 400 P 0. Covariance can take any value between and. Multivariate Statistical Analysis Multivariate statistics includes all statistical techniques for analyzing samples made of two or more variables. Draw n samples from a population. first array represents chi square values and second array represnts p values. If all the values of the given variable are multiplied by a constant and all the values of another variable are multiplied by a similar or different constant then the value of covariance also changes. In a continuous uniform distribution probability of Y taking a value in an interval from c to d is proportional to its size versus the size of the whole interval b a. Covariance and Correlation Statistical Analysis Covariance Matrix The Covariance matrix of X_ NP is a P P matrix where the covariance of any two features P1 P2 is calculated by the formula Cov P1 P2 frac sum P1 _i bar P1 P2 _i bar P2 N For diagonal elements Cov P1 P1 Var P1 Correlation Matrix The Correlation matrix of X_ NP is also a P P matrix where the correlation of any two features P1 P2 is calculated by the formula Corr P1 P2 frac Cov P1 P2 sigma_ P1 sigma_ P2 The correlation of an element with itself Corr P1 P1 1 or the highest value possible. p value alpha The orange point has a p value greater than the alpha. The greater the magnitude of T the greater the evidence against the null hypothesis. Correlation values are standardized whereas covariance values are not. It says that variables like disp cyl hp wt mpg drat and vs contribute significantly to PC1 first principal component. Consider the above normal distribution. When the PDF is graphically plotted the area under the curve indicates the interval in which the variable will fall. Gender of a customer with values as Male Female as the predictor X and Exited describes whether a customer is leaving the bank with values Yes No as the response y. These Z scores are important because they tell us how far a value is from the mean. 1107 E_1 400 text 0. Term in denominator N 1 indicates the degrees of freedom. To read this chart one has to look at the extreme ends top down left and right. It is used more often than variance because the unit in which it is measured is the same as that of mean a measure of central tendency. Mean Add up the values in the data set and then divide by the number of values. Uniform Distribution There are two kinds of uniform random variables discrete and continuous ones. Specifically whether the simplarity difference between their central tendency e. Gaussian noise added with a mean of a 50 and a standard deviation of 10 summarize plot Select all Categorical variables and dependent variable Use ttest_rel when the data samples may represent two independent measures or evaluations of the same object. Kruskal Wallis H Test Generalization of Mann Whitney U test. 9473 Female No 140 146 0. 2 Use a dimension reduction algorithm such as Principle Component Analysis PCA. Friedman Test Generalization of the Kruskal Wallis H Test to more than two samples. Degrees of Freedom To explain what degrees of freedom are let us just take an example. linspace 0 100 101 rank data review first 10 ranked samples Random numbers drawn from a Gaussian distribution with mean 100 and standard deviation 20.
