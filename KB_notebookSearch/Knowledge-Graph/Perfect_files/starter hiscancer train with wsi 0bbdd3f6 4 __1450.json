Hey I m just a simple kerneling bot not a Kaggle Competitions Grandmaster There are 2 csv files in the current version of the dataset The next hidden code cells define functions for plotting data. Happy Kaggling plotting linear algebra accessing directory structure data processing CSV file I O e. If you re inspired to dig deeper click the blue Fork Notebook button at the top of this kernel to begin editing. Depending on the data not all plots will be made. input train_with_wsi. csv has 220025 rows in reality but we are only loading previewing the first 1000 rows. csvLet s take a quick look at what the data looks like Distribution graphs histogram bar graph of sampled columns Let s check 2nd file. This will create a copy of the code and environment for you to edit. Click on the Code button in the published kernel to reveal the hidden code. IntroductionGreetings from the Kaggle bot This is an automatically generated kernel with starter code demonstrating how to read in the data and begin exploring. csv has 220025 rows in reality but we are only loading previewing the first 1000 rows specify None if want to read whole file train_with_wsi1. Exploratory AnalysisTo begin this exploratory analysis first import libraries and define functions for plotting the data using matplotlib. csvLet s take a quick look at what the data looks like Distribution graphs histogram bar graph of sampled columns ConclusionThis concludes your starter analysis To go forward from here click the blue Fork Notebook button at the top of this kernel.
