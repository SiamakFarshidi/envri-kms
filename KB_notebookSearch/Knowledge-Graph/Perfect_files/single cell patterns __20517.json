The phenomenon of how genetically identical cells can show functional heterogeneity for example in response to drug treatment is poorly understood. Please note that you are required to submit associated detection score Confidence for each prediction. com articles s41592 019 0658 6. More examples 1. More examples 16. For some images all cells will inherit the labels from image level labels. Here you can also see how patterns look like in different cell lines.

Good luck and enjoy Image channelsAll images have 4 channels Red Microtubules Green Protein of interest Blue Nucleus Yellow Endoplasmic reticulum as followed Protein localization patternsIt s always nice to know a bit about what you are working on isn t it So in this part I will give you a basic introduction about the patterns that you are asked to predict. For this competition we specifically annotated every single cell in a subset of images mostly private never published and some public images with higher SCV compared to public HPA images to act as test set. Nuclear bodiesNuclear bodies are visible as distinct spots in the nucleoplasm. SCV and multi localization examplesSingle or muliple patterns can be seen together in a cell. NucleoplasmThe nucleus is found in the center of cell and can be identified with the help of the signal in the blue nucleus channel. I left out blue channels so you can see the green one more clearly. More examples 12. AggresomeAn aggresome can be seen as a dense cytoplasmic inclusion which is usually found close to the nucleus in a region where the microtubule network is disrupted. They are highly dynamic varying in numbers and size in response to environmental and cellular cues. Here are some examples to demonstrate the SCV scroll down for SCV and multi localization examples section. And yes as you might have guessed this overlaps the staining in the red channel. More examples 10. NegativeThis class include negative stainings and unspecific patterns. Actin filaments can be seen as long and rather straight bundles of filaments or as branched networks of thinner filaments. They can be round or more elongated. epdf no_publisher_access 1 r3_referer nature. PNG attachment Capture. Nuclear membraneThe nuclear membrane appears as a thin circle around the nucleus. It can appear smooth or granular and the staining is often stronger close to the nucleus. More examples 15. Nuclear specklesNuclear speckles can be seen as irregular and mottled spots inside the nucleoplasm. The ER can be identified with the help of the staining in the yellow ER channel. More examples 13. The same type of data was used in a previous Human Protein Atlas Classification challenge https www. PNG Please also note that border cells where most of the cells are out of the field of view and to cells that have been damaged or suffer from staining artifacts. Vesicles Peroxisomes Endosomes Lysosomes Lipid droplets Cytoplasmic bodies 18. Plasma membraneThis class includes plasma membrane and cell junctions. It has a folded ribbon like appearance but the shape and size can vary between cell types and in response to cellular various processes. They can appear similar to microtubules but do not match well with the staining in the red microtubule channel. A good rule of thumb that our annotators used in generating ground truth is if more than half of the cell is not present don t predict it In total there are 19 classes 0 18 that will be scored. Endoplasmic reticulumThe endoplasmic reticulum ER is recognized by a network like staining in the cytosol which is usually stronger close to the nucleus and weaker close to the edges of the cell. U 2 OS A 341 The model will be graded on mean Average Precision score for each matched cell passing segmentation IoU threhold of 0. More examples 6. These patterns sometimes vary among 17 cell lines in this competition A 431 A549 EFO 21 HAP1 HEK 293 HUVEC TERT2 HaCaT HeLa PC 3 RH 30 RPTEC TERT1 SH SY5Y SK MEL 30 SiHa U 2 OS U 251 MG hTCEpi. org learn dictionary cell under CELL STRUCTURE. CytosolThe cytosol extends from the plasma membrane to the nuclear membrane. com c human protein atlas image classification that aimed to classify image level labels paper https www. Also Cytokinetic bridge is not in this competition just for demonstration. More examples 9. At this stage the chromatin of the cell is condensed as visible by intense DAPI staining. Any combination of patterns can be possible for a single cell except 18 if the cell s staining is Negative there isn t any other pattern. For example this is how Plasma Membrane looks in U2OS left vs A 431 right. We want to study this observed variation to better understand the functional heterogeneity of cells. More examples 5. Intermediate filaments may extend through the whole cytosol or be concentrated in an area close to the nucleus. Note that Negative cells will be present in images labeled as other classes as well. Both are at the outer edge of the cell. In the hidden test set of this challenge we purposely chose images with high single cell variation SCV. This means that the cells have no green staining negative or have staining but no pattern can be deciphered from the staining unspecific. More examples 4. Therefore I believe you won t gain significant advantages with a metric learning approach like the winning solution last challenge. The number and size of nucleoli varies between cell types. com c hpa single cell image classification overview evaluation. They vary in shape size and numbers depending on the type of bodies as well as cell type but are usually more rounded compared to nuclear speckles. As you can see the label distribution is imbalanced but even the rarest organelle class has at least 78 examples at least 1 cell in each image carry this pattern. Furthermore the patterns sometimes differ in different cell lines in here we have 17 cell lines. Welcome to the Human Protein Atlas Single Cell Competition This is a single cell classification challenge. Plasma membrane sometimes appears as a more or less distinct edge around the cell occasionally with characteristic protrusions or ruffles. 6 See Evaluation tab https www. You can read more about the Organelles https www. As you see within the same image same cell types same protein staining the green patterns are not similar in every cell. Mitotic spindleThe mitotic spindle can be seen as an intricate structure of microtubules radiating from each of the centrosomes at opposite ends of a dividing cell mitosis. We also want to clarify that there is a public test set for public leaderboard and private test set private leaderboard. Nucleoplasm Mitochrondria ER Plasma membrane Nucleoplasm However for other images especially in the test set each cell will have only a part of the image level label or completely new label 18 Negative. Therefore a single cell classifier is more helpful than a whole image classifier as developed in the previous challenge. They can be seen as a more or less distinct staining of a small area at the origin of the microtubules close to the nucleus. NucleoliNucleoli can be seen as slightly elongated circular areas in the nucleoplasm which usually display a much weaker staining in the blue DAPI channel. Predicted masks are run length encoded Please note that there are multilabeled cells more than one class for each cell. In other words the test set will have higher SCV than the training set. More examples 7. org humanproteome cell organelle and explore the Cell dictionary https www. Focal adhesions are large macromolecular assemblies at the plasma membrane through which bundles of actin filaments connect to the extracellular matrix ECM. There are NO images in the private test set that were ever published. A staining of the nucleoplasm may include the whole nucleus or of the nucleus without the regions known as nucleoli Class 2. More examples 17. Vesicles and punctate cytosolic patternsThis class includes small circular compartments in the cytosol Vesicles Peroxisomes lipid metabolism Endosomes sorting compartments Lysosomes degradation of molecules or eating up dead molecules Lipid droplets fat storage Cytoplasmic bodies distinct granules in the cytosol. Just like people all cells are different in terms of their morphology shape size and they can also differ in the spatial distribution of their proteins. In some cell lines the staining can be uniform across the entire cell. The results are published and you can read the discussion on the strategies of the winning teams. They are usually located close to the edges of the cells. Label distribution in the training setBelow is the distribution of image level labels in the training set. This is called single cell variability SCV and has been observed across images in HPA and been described in numerous scientific publications. More examples 2. More examples 3. More examples 14. This competition is a weakly labeled challenge based on the image level label you build models to predict labels for each individual cell. cell line distribution plot. More examples 11. More examples 8. Cell junctions can be observed at contact sites between neighboring cells. Golgi apparatusThe Golgi apparatus is a rather large organelle that is located next to the nucleus close to the centrosome from which the microtubules in the red channel originate. When a cell is dividing the two centrosomes move to opposite ends of the cell and form the poles of the mitotic spindle. This will be used as order predictions for matched cells. It is not perfectly smooth and sometimes it is also possible to see the folds of the membrane as small circles or dots inside the nucleus. It is almost always possible to detect the center from which they all originate the centrosome. The size and exact shape of the mitotic spindle changes during mitotic progression clearly reflecting the different stages of mitosis. CentrosomeThis class includes centrosomes and centriolar satellites. Nucleoli fibrillar centerNucleoli fibrillary center can appear as a spotty cluster or as a single bigger spot in the nucleolus depending on the cell type. In this case predict separate detections for each class using the same mask. MicrotubulesMicrotubules are seen as thin strands that stretch throughout the whole cell. Intermediate filamentsIntermediate filaments often exhibit a slightly tangled structure with strands crossing every so often.
