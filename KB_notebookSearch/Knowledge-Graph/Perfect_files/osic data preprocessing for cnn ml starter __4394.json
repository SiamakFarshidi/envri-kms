The pixels that fall outside of these bounds get the fixed value 2000. jpg The unit of measurement in CT scans is the Hounsfield Unit HU which is a measure of radiodensity. The first step is setting these values to 0 which currently corresponds to air. Whilst this may seem like a very simple step it has quite some edge cases due to rounding. png By default however the returned values are not in this unit. If we choose to resample everything to 1mm1mm1mm pixels we can use 3D convnets without worrying about learning zoom slice thickness invariance. CT scanners are carefully calibrated to accurately measure this. 652344 This means we have 10. Some scanners have cylindrical scanning bounds but the output image is square. A commonly used set of thresholds in the LUNA16 competition to normalize between are 1000 and 400. For a different scan this may be 1. Below code worked well for us and deals with the edge cases Although we have each individual slices it is not immediately clear how thick each slice is. This will change the thickness of our slice in millimeters. read_csv lets read metadeta of pydiacom file order the slice serially lets create a function for above task Convert to int16 from sometimes int16 should be possible as values should always be low enough 32k Set outside of scan pixels to 0 The intercept is usually 1024 so air is approximately 0 Convert to Hounsfield units HU lets take alook at patient Determine current pixel spacing Position the scan upright so the head of the patient would be at the top facing the camera get image in order h w c Fancy indexing verts faces to generate a collection of triangles. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT https www. 5 which means that the distance between slices is 2. Because a CT slice is typically reconstructed at 512 x 512 voxels each slice represents approximately 370 mm of data in length and width. PictureCoverageBy increasing the slice thickness we will increase our coverage. Using the metadata from the DICOM we can figure out the size of each voxel as the slice thickness. png attachment 4rlyReh. In order to display the CT in 3D isometric form which we will do below and also to compare between different scans it would be useful to ensure that each slice is resampled in 1x1x1 mm pixels and slices. With these steps your images are ready for consumption by your CNN or other ML method linear algebra data processing CSV file I O e. This pixel size coarseness of the scan differs from scan to scan e. ResamplingA scan may have a pixel spacing of 2. To determine this mean you simply average all images in the whole dataset. 25 in the LUNA16 competition. These files contain a lot of metadata such as the pixel size so how long one pixel is in every dimension in the real world. This can cause blurring in our image also known as partial voluming. the distance between slices may differ which can hurt performance of CNN approaches. com dicom processing segmentation visualization in python In this notebook we learn Loading DICOM data using pydicom Used 1D histogram 2D and 3D plots to display DICOM images. Slice Thickness is a parameter that can be selected by the technologist. 00 mm slices and each voxel represents 0. Pre processed data for future machine learning projects Conversion of pixel value to Hundsfeld units Resampling for isotropy normalization zero centeringLoading the filesDicom is the de facto file standard in medical imaging. 000000Pixel Spacing row col 0. com gzuidhof full preprocessing tutorial https www. Here s some code you can use Zero centeringAs a final preprocessing step it is advisory to zero center your data so that your mean value is 0. The CT scanners are calibrated to return accurate HU measurements. Also it takes quite a while. 3D Plotting NormalizationOur values currently range from 1024 to around 2000. To do this you simply subtract the mean pixel value from all pixels. There is no such thing as an image with lower contrast or brightness like in normal pictures. From Wikipedia 4rlyReh. Warning Do not zero center with the mean per image like is done in some kernels on here. By increasing the slice thickness many more different types of tissues will be collected in our 2D slice. Next let s go back to HU units by multiplying with the rescale slope and adding the intercept which are conveniently stored in the metadata of the scans. Anything above 400 is not interesting to us as these are simply bones with different radiodensity. 725 this can be problematic for automatic analysis e. We can deal with this by isomorphic resampling which we will do later.
