Enhancing Image Resolution using ESRGAN TensorFlow ModelWhen working with a Image Data problem we can come across images with different resolutions especially images that have a resolution of 128 x 128 or even less. pdf by Xintao Wang for more details about this model. The model only supports images with 3 color channels. Setup Utility Functions Enhance ResolutionI hope this little tutorial was helpful if it was then please do consider it to UPVOTE. Let s get started. Consider a scenario where you only have such low resolution images for training your model. This model is trained on DIV2K Dataset on bicubically downsampled images on image patches of size 128 x 128Please read the paper https arxiv. The fancy looking ESRGAN is an acronym for Enhanced Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Network. dev captain pool esrgan tf2 1 that can enhance the resolution of a low res image. Saves unscaled Tensor Images Plots images from image tensors Load Model Load Plot Save Original Image Enhance Resolution start timer end timer Plotting High Resolution Image. We shall now get cracking with the implementation of this model.
