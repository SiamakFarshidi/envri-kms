Now we can perform following steps 1. import VGG16 architecture from keras. The dense layers comprises of 4096 4096 and 1000 nodes each. So the equation of A3 will be modified as A3 relu W2. Following is the architecture of VGG19 model. So now the activation A1 is being passed to Residual Block which in turns gives new activation A3. Hence adding the residual blocks skip connections does not hurt the network performance but infact increases the chances that new layers will learn something useful. Let s predict the output on new images and check the outcome. This output is then added with the activation of the next layer. Flatten will produce a long vector of feature elements. In VGG networks the use of 3 x 3 convolutions with stride 1 gives an effective receptive filed equivalent to 7 7. A long dataframe will be created. In the end I have explained how to generate image features using pretrained models and use them in machine learning models. One can flatten them or sequee them in order to use them in ML models. First load some images and preprocess them. Squeeze will produce a 3D matrix of the features 3. Also add a test dataset contianing images from both classes. By performing the 1x1 convolution the inception block preserves the spatial dimentions but reduces the depth. png Pre Trained Model InceptionV3 1. However this is only the worst case situation but the it may turn out that these additional layers learns something useful. Transfer Learning 1. First we ll create a dataset containing two classes of images bananas and strawberrys. I will be applying variance filter later on this dataframe to reduce the dimentionality. Other ideas to avoid this step perform PCA SVD to obtain the dense features. 3 InceptionNetsAlso known as GoogleNet consists of total 22 layers and was the winning model of 2014 image net challenge. jpeg nbsp nbsp 1. This means there are fewer parameters to train. Add the saved weights to the architecture 3. It consists of about 14 M hand labelled annotated images which contains over 22 000 day to day categories. Every year ImageNet competition is hosted in which the smaller version of this dataset with 1000 categories is used with an aim to accurately classify the images. com max 1600 1 cufAO77aeSWdShs3ba5ndg. The variants of Resnets such as resnet34 resnet50 resnet101 have produced the solutions with very high accuracy in Imagenet competitions. Image Feature Extraction 3. The authors of the paper were able to create the deep neural network architecture with 152 layers. Image Feature Extraction using PreTrained Models Lets look at how one can use pre trained models for feature extraction The extracted features can be used for Machine Learning purposes. CNN Architectures VGG Resnet InceptionNet XceptionNet UseCases Image Feature Extraction Transfer LearningA Gold mine dataset for comuter vision is the ImageNet dataset. It was learnt that deeper networks are performing better. com 2017 10 convnet architectures image_0 8fa3b810. 2 nbsp nbsp VGG19 VGG19 is a similar model architecure as VGG16 with three additional convolutional layers it consists of a total of 16 Convolution layers and 3 dense layers. without skip connection where W2 and b2 are weights and bias associated with layer L2. We can load the model architecture given in the library and then add all the weights to the respective layers. A2 b2 A1 If we use L2 regularization or the weight decay methods they will force W2 and b2 to become close to zero. A2 b2. Before using the pretrained models lets write a few functions which will be used to make some predictions. But with skip connection another term A1 will be passed to L2. Apart from the regular output layer this network also consists of two auxillary classification outputs which are used to inject gradients at lower layers. So in the network A the input X is passed to this Neural Network NN to give the activation A1. These connections are enabled by skip connections which are shown in the following figure. com 2016 09 inception_implement. Following are the problems with deeper networks Network becomes difficult to optimize Vanishing Exploding Gradeints Degradation Problem accuracy first saturates and then degrades Skip Connections So to address these problems authors of the resnet architecture came up with the idea of skip connections with the hypothesis that the deeper layers should be able to learn something as equal as shallower layers. To enable these connections or essentially enable this addition operation one need to ensure the same dimentions of convolutions through out the network that s why resnets have same 3 by 3 convolutions throughout. The inception module is shown in the following figure https hackathonprojects. 5 Xception NetsXception is an extension of the Inception architecture which replaces the standard Inception modules with depthwise separable convolutions. Transfer Learning Example Lets look at the implemetation of transfer learning using pre trained model features. However it turned out that this is not really true. A3 A1 This means that Identitiy function is easy for residual blocks to learn. com max 2000 1 uXfC5fcbDsL0TJG4T8PsVw. In the worst case if these become zero then A3 relu A1 because relu will output 0 for negative A1 for positive and we know that A1 is previous activation from relu which is positive. without hurting the network performance. This network contains total 16 layers in which weights and bias parameters are learnt. Let s look at the usage using pre trained resnet 50 model. It s Key Characteristics are 1. A total of 13 convolutional layers are stacked one after the other and 3 dense layers for classification. By addition of residual blocks model complexity was not increased. 4 ResnetsOriginal Paper https arxiv. In this kernel I have discussed these popular architectures such as VGG16 19 ResNet AlexNet etc. The number of filters in the convolution layers follow an increasing pattern similar to decoder architecture of autoencoder. com max 987 1 pUyst_ciesOz_LUg0HocYg. First step is to load the weights of the pre trained model in the model architecture. Notice that an additional argument is passed include_top False which states that we do not want to add the last layer of this architecture. As this is only copying the previous activation to the next layers. 1 nbsp nbsp VGG16 VGG16 was publised in 2014 and is one of the simplest among the other cnn architectures used in Imagenet competition. The key idea of inception module is to design good local network topology network within a network These modules or blocks acts as the multi level feature extractor in which convolutions of different sizes are obtained to create a diversified feature map The inception modules also consists of 1 x 1 convolution blocks whose role is to perform dimentionaltiy reduction. Inception modules are the fundamental block of InceptionNets. The following code block shows the implementation of VGG16 in keras. Comparison of different architectures The following image describes the relative comparison of these architectures in terms of performance as size. now the extracted features are stored in the variable resnet_features. png So the role of these connections is to perform identity function over the activation of shallower layer which in turn produces the same activation. Why it works Lets discuss why residual networks are successful and enables the addition of more and more layers without the key problems ie. 1 Dataset PreparationTransfer learning can be implemented in two steps Step 1 Image Feature Exraction Step 2 Training a Classifier Step 1 Feature Extraction using pre trained models resnet50 Iterate in the images call the same function used in point 2 for image feature extraction we will use the flatten representation of these features Next Convert the features from dictionary format to pandas dataframe. The cons of this architecture are that it is slow to train and produces the model with very large size. In that case the network performance will improve. As the next step we will pass an image to this model and identify the features. Many winning solutions of the ImageNet Challenge have used state of the art convolutional neural network architectures to beat the best possible accuracy thresholds. CNN Architectures 1. png Now consider a more deeper network B in which a residual block with 2 extra layers and a skip connection is added in the previous network. So the overall network s dimentions are not increased exponentially. The informative features are obtained by max pooling layers applied at different steps in the architecture. PreTrained Model VGG16Keras library also provides the pre trained model in which one can load the saved model weights and use them for different purposes transfer learning image feature extraction and object detection. The VGG16 architecture is given below https tech. Key Advantage By using residual blocks in the network one can construct networks of any depth with the hypothesis that new layers are actually helping to learn new underlying patterns in the input data. if there was no skip connection then A3 was A3 relu W2. Contents From the high level perspective I have discussed three main components 1. So a simple neural network with only 20 rows of training data is able to correctly classify the two images on test set. EndNotes Thanks for viewing this kernel If you liked it please upvote. png Implementation VGG16Let s see how we can create this architecture using python s keras library. com images news 573 cover. pdfAll the previous models used deep neural networks in which they stacked many convolution layers one after the other. https cdn images 1. Consider a plain neural network A without residual network as shown. Use model to perform predictions 1. A possible solution is copying the activations from shallower layers and setting additional layers to identity mapping.
