Race or ethnicity African American men are more likely than men of other races to develop prostate according to different research conducted in this area. An imaging test called an Axumin positron emission tomography PET scan may assist in detecting prostate cancer that has come back in men whose PSA levels rise after they ve had treatment. DNA mutations that turn on oncogenes which help cells growand divide or that turn off tumor suppressor genes which slow cell division or make cells die when they should can cause prostate cells to grow abnormally and lead to cancer. Other than the lymph nodes near the prostate the most common site of prostate cancer spread or metastatis is the bones especially in the spine. The main risk factors variables are as follows Age Although prostate cancer can occur at any age it is most often found in men over age 50 and more than two thirds of men diagnosed with the disease are over 65.

If your father or brother had prostate cancer your risk is two to three times greater than if you had no family history of the disease. Analysis The dataset consists of around 11 000 whole side images WSI of digitized H E stained prostate biopsies originating from Radboud University Medical Center and the Karolinska Institute. Whether cancer is suspected based on symptoms or a digital rectal exam or PSA test the actual diagnosis is made with a prostate biposy a procedure in which samples of your prostate are removed and examined under a microscope. Diet Scientists believe that diet is a critical factor in prostate cancer risk. Prostate cancer starts in the prostate a gland located below the bladder and in front of the rectum. Your prostate surrounds part of your urethra the tube that carries urine and semon out of your body.

A diet high in red meat dairy foods and calcium and low in fruits and vegetables may play a part. Good prostate cancer screening tests like the prostate specific antigen PSA test have resulted in early diagnosis in about 80 percent of men with the disease. Also it is the third leading cause of cancer death behind lung cancer and colon cancer in men in the United States. Hormone levels Research suggests that the development of prostate cancer is linked to higher levels of certain hormones such as testosterone the main male sex hormone. What is prostate cancer Prostate cancer is the most common cancer after skin cancer in men in the United States. isup_grade is the target variable which illustrats the severity of the cancer on a 0 5 scale. About 1 man in 41 will die of prostate cancer. In many men doctors first detect signs of prostate cancer during routine check up. Prostate cancer risk factors Numerous factors may contribute to prostate cancer risk. A core needle biopsy the main method for diagnosing prostate cancer is typically performed in a doctor s office by a urologist as follows Using transrectal ultrasound TRUS and a local anesthetic the doctor inserts a needle into your prostate through a probe in your rectum. Symptoms of prostate cancer Prostate cancer symptoms typically don t appear early in the disease. Nationality Prostate cancer is most common in North America northwestern Europe Australia and the Caribbean and less common in Asia Africa and Central and South America. DNA is the chemical that makes up your genes which control when your cells grow divide into new cells and die. What causes prostate cancer While the exact cause of prostate cancer is unknown generally speaking it results from mutations in cell DNA. The prostate contains several types of cells but nearly all prostate cancers develop from glandular cells which make fluid that becomes part of semen. In others the disease is very aggressive. This is known as metastatic prostate cancer. About 6 cases in 10 are diagnosed in men who are 65 or older and it is rare in men under 40. The disease is less common among men of Asian or Hispanic Latino descent than among those of European descent. Before the scan you receive an injection of fluciclovine F18 Axumin a radioactive agent that tends to collect in areas of cancer activity which then light up on your scan. Vitamin E and folic acid are also thought to increase the risk. Importing Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis. About 1 man in 9 will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during his lifetime. About this notebook This notebook consists of domain knowledge about the prostatce cancer as well predictive analytics. In some men it is slow growing and unlikely to cause serious problems. If the prostate which is normally about the size of a walnut grows too large it can slow or block the flow of urine. Many men develop a noncancerous condition called bengin prostatic hyperplasia BPH or enlargement of the prostate. Family history and genetics A family history of prostate cancer may increase your risk particularly if you have a number of close relatives who were younger than 60 when they were diagnosed. gleason_score is an alternative cancer severity rating system with more levels than the ISUP scale. Prostate cancer cells can spread by invading nearby organs and tissues such as the bladder or rectum or by travelling through the blood or lymph to other parts of the body. Your prostate makes and stores seminal fluid a milkey liquid that protects and nourishes sperm.
