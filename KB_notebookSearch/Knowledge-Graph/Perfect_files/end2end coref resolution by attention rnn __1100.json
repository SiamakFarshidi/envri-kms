You can compare the result of this model with the result by other non RNN based DL models implemented in another kernel https www. floatx don t pass the mask to the next layers apply mask after the exp. This completition only focus on a specific case of the generic reference resolution problem and we only need pick out the correct mention from two candidates which simplifies the model implementation. Import Data Explore Features for Building Mention Pair Distributed Representation Position FeaturesEncode the absolute positions in the sentence and the relative position between the pronoun and the entities. will be re normalized next Cast the mask to floatX to avoid float64 upcasting in theano sequences inputs pos tag mention position in the sentence addtional mention pair features rnn rnn encoding rnn encoding attention aggregated rnn embedding mention rnn embedding mention pair features MLP Layers. Extract SentencesSelect the surrounding 100 words around the mention in the sentence. A workaround is to add a very small positive number \u03b5 to the sum. will be re normalized next Cast the mask to floatX to avoid float64 upcasting in theano in some cases especially in the early stages of training the sum may be almost zero and this results in NaN s.
