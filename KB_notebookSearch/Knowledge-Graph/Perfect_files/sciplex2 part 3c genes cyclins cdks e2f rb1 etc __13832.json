Cyclin A1 was shown to be expressed in testis and brain as well as in several leukemic cell lines and is thought to primarily function in the control of meiosis. In contrast E2F repressors stay constant especially since they are often expressed in quiescent cells.

Cyclin dependent kinases regulatory subunit 2 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the CKS2 gene. This cyclin was found to bind to important cell cycle regulators such as Rb family proteins transcription factor E2F1 and the Kip Cip family of CDK inhibitor proteins. In normal cells persistent cyclin A expression prevents the stabilization of microtubules bound to kinetochores even in cells with aligned chromosomes.

Cyclins are proteins which heavily involved in cell cycle regulation. 14 15 Notably recent studies have shown that cyclin A creates a cellular environment that promotes microtubule detachment from kinetochores in prometaphase to ensure efficient error correction and faithful chromosome segregation. Seven cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor proteins have thus far been identified. E2F family members play a major role during the G1 S transition in mammalian and plant cell cycle. 24262 cells x 58347 genes GSM4150377_sciPlex2_pData. Cells must separate their chromosomes precisely an event that relies on the bi oriented attachment of chromosomes to spindle microtubules through specialized structures called kinetochores. It may help the cyclin CDK complex with substrates that have multiple phosphorylation sites by increasing affinity for the substrate. FunctionThe CKS1B protein binds to the catalytic subunit of the cyclin dependent kinases and is essential for their biological function. Consequently these cells may fail to correct errors leading to higher rates of chromosome mis segregation. There are also several orphan cyclins for which no Cdk partner has been identified. 7 Clinical significanceCks1 depleted breast cancer cells not only exhibit slowed G 1 progression but also accumulate in G 2 M due to blocked mitotic entry. com alexandervc singlecell rnaseq exposed to multiple compounds discussion 228844https microbenotes.

Cyclins and cyclin dependent kinases should be understood in pair as name suggests CDK is such kinase which activates only when binds with special molecule cyclin. During G2 cyclin F targets all three activator E2Fs for degradation thereby turning off a main cell cycle transcriptional engine. They are named by the small letter p followed by their molecular weight in kilodaltons. svgCorresponding table Table 2 Cyclins and CDKs by Cell Cycle Phase Phase Cyclin CDK G0 C Cdk3 G1 D E Cdk4 Cdk2 Cdk6 S A E Cdk2 G2 A Cdk2 Cdk1 M B Cdk1At the bottom of wikipedia page https en. Cdk1 is comprised mostly by the bare protein kinase motif which other protein kinases share. This process is known as phosphorylation where the substrate gains a phosphate group and the high energy ATP molecule donates a phosphate group. Cyclins function as activating subunits of enzymatic complex together with cyclin dependent kinases CDKs. 3 Cks1 binds the carboxy lobe of the CDK and recognizes phosphorylated residues.
