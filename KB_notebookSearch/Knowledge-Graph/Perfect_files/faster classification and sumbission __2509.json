This is the strategy I ll follow 1. com linshokaku faster hpa cell segmentation Even Faster HPA Cell Segmentation https www. Cell by Cell classification Assuming we have a great classification model we would proceed to analyze the cells in every new image from the test file. blend rgby images into single array Create PIL Image a bytes object dt for hpa_image to remove the small pseduo nuclei this is to remove the cell borders signal from cell mask. Segmentation and Classification with EfficientNet https www. pth segmentator cellsegmentator. max_rows 600 display. com glopezzz segmentation and classification with efficientnet pip install. To identify this we can use the length of the sample_sumbission. If we re handleing the public file we can take only 50 images or less as our objective is only to save commit and if we recognize the data is the private data we know we must use the full data length. input hpacellsegmentatormodelweights dpn_unet_nuclei_v1. input hpacellsegmentatorraman HPA Cell Segmentation check input mask convert input mask to expected COCO API input RLE encode mask compress and base64 encoding Get single image that blends all RGBY into RGB Introduce the images as arrays. Save the model outputReferences Faster HPA Cell Segmentation https www. max_columns 5 display. com dschettler8845 explained to me in this discussion Does notebook running time limit include the scoring time https www. Crop the cell and resize to the shape of the training 224 224 3 4. Iter through every cell. The Image size will depend on how you trained your model. logical_and with some revision to replace this func. com c hpa single cell image classification discussion 223281 To accelerate the save commit procedure an interesting idea is to identify wether we re dealing with the public test data or the private test data as we re only interested in processing the second one for the competition submission. max_colwidth 1 display data_df. Apply cell segmentation like the one above. option_context display. Tuned for segmentation hpa images exclude the green area first this part is to use green channel and extend cell label to green channel benefit is to exclude cells clear on border but without nucleus with pd. 25 device cuda padding True multi_channel_model True Cell Segmentation and Classification At first I tried separating the pipeline in different loops but that required saving the results in the RAM memmory and when I tried submmiting the notebook I kept getting this message Notebook Exceeded Allowed Compute Therefore now I execute all in different batches so that I only have to save the final PredictionString Loading the pre_trained model. In my case I used EfficientNet therefore it requires a data size of 224 224 3 NUC_MODEL. CellSegmentator NUC_MODEL CELL_MODEL scale_factor 0. input hpacellsegmentatormodelweights dpn_unet_cell_3ch_v1. Can use the function above. csv file which is 559 for the public file and larger for the private file.
