Data preparation detectron2 provides high level API for training custom dataset. I insert LossEvalHook before evalutor to work well. Then I noticed that we can use many augmentations in albumentations so I implemented AlbumentationsMapper to support it. Data VisualizationIt s also very easy to visualize prepared training dataset with detectron2. width width of the image. com c vinbigdata chest xray abnormalities detection discussion 207955.

There are really many That s all I found that the competition data is not so many 15000 for all images 4000 images after filtering No finding images. Now all the preparation has done MyTrainer overwraps build_evaluator method of DefaultTrainer provided by detectron2 to support validation dataset evaluation. 1 step training prediction https www. annotation This is the ground truth annotation data for object detection which contains following bbox bounding box pixel location with shape n_boxes 4 bbox_mode BoxMode. ims_per_batch cfg. transforms with MyMapper class it provides basic augmentations. out visualizer.

TrainingIt s actually very easy to use multiple gpus for training. build_evaluator This class method defines how to construct Evaluator. Visualize loss curve competition metric AP40As I explained the calculated metrics are saved in metrics. detectron2 trainObject detaction task to find a class and location of floor plans doors. It provides Visualizer class we can use it to draw an image with bounding box as following. How many augmentations can be used in albumentations You can see official github page all Pixel level transforms https github. build_train_loader build_test_loader These class methods deine how to construct DataLoader for training data validation data respectively. get_checkpoint_url config_name cfg. I also uploaded the original sized png images vinbigdata chest xray original png https www. Below code is to visualize the same data 4 times. Now the methods are ready. transforms albumentations augmentations properly handles bounding box. In my experiment Calcification seems to be the most difficult class to predict. OUTPUT_DIR original_output_dir cfg.

It is loaded beforehand of the training on memory so it should contain all the metadata image filepath etc to construct training dataset but should not contain heavy data. TEST vinbigdata_valid cfg. It does not take long time to train less than a day so this competition may be a good choice for beginners who want to learn object detection If this kernel helps you please upvote to keep me motivated Thanks Next step VinBigData detectron2 prediction https www.

OUTPUT_DIR exist_ok True trainer MyTrainer cfg trainer. get_image 1 Let training initialize from model zoo pick a good LR 300 iterations seems good enough for this toy dataset you will need to train longer for a practical dataset do not decay learning rate 128 faster and good enough for this toy dataset default 512 only has one class Door. config import CfgNode as CN cfg get_cfg cfg. com facebookresearch detectron2 blob master configs COCO Detection faster_rcnn_R_50_FPN_3x. get_config_file config_name cfg. print anom_ind cv2_imshow out. aug_kwargs pass aug_kwargs to cfg original_output_dir cfg. Thus bounding box is adjusted when the image is scaled rotated etc At first I was using detectron2. Please refer official example train_net. com xhlulu vinbigdata chest xray resized png 256x256 to skip the preprocessing and focus on modeling part. category_id class label id for each bounding box with shape n_boxes get_dicts is for train dataset preparation and get_dicts_test is for test dataset preparation. com c vinbigdata chest xray abnormalities detection discussion 220295 Suggests how to predict more smaller sized high aspect ratio bonding boxes. We need object detection model We choosen R50 FPN https github. py L79 L88 For visualization. Since mapper is used inside DataLoader we can check its behavior by constucting DataLoader and visualize the data processed by the DataLoader. The defined Trainer class has class method build_train_loader. To define custom dataset we need to create list of dict dataset_dicts where each dict contains following file_name file name of the image.

In practice loading all the taining image arrays are too heavy to be loaded on memory so these are loaded inside DataLoader on demand This is done by mapper class in detectron2 as I will expain later. 5 Visualize data. Training method implementationsBasically we don t need to implement neural network part detectron2 already implements famous architectures and provides its pre trained weights. base_lr pick a good LR cfg. BATCH_SIZE_PER_IMAGE flags. IMS_PER_BATCH flags. 0 is used in this kaggle docker image. image_id id of the image index is used here. These models are summarized in MODEL_ZOO.
