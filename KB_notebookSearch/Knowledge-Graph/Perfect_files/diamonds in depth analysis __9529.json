We ll Create a New Feature based on the Dimensions in the Next Section called Volume and Visualize how it affects the Price. 3 AdaBosst Regression 7. Feature Encoding there_you_go_5 6. Split the data into train and test. 1 Importing Libraries 1. But what makes it truly Valuable is that this Rarity coincides with the desire of many to possess it. 4 Feature Engineering 4. Github Link https github. jpg How Diamonds are formed Diamonds are formed deep within the Earth about 100 miles or so below the surface in the upper mantle. They are the hardest Gemstones known to man and can be scratched only by other Diamonds. 5 GradientBoosting Regression 7. Inclusions can be Cracks or even Small Minerals or Crystals that have formed inside the Diamond. 1 Carat Carat refers to the Weight of the Stone not the Size. Click Here to Learn More about How Depth Affects the Price of Diamonds. Blemishing is a result of utting and polishing process than the environmental conditions in which the diamond was formed. There s a lot of pressure the weight of the overlying rock bearing down so that combination of high temperature and high pressure is what s necessary to grow diamond crystals in the Earth.

DIAMONDS IN DEPTH ANALYSIS You can also view the notebook on the link below. Z Height of the Diamond in mm. com blog understanding how diamond clarity affects value https i. Then Apply Feature Scaling although it s not neccessary in this case. And the Pearson s Correlation shows that there s a slightly inverse relation between the two. Color Color of the Diamond. Y Width of the Diamond in mm. This is because there is a Higher Wastage of the Rough Stone as more Material needs to be Removed in order to achieve better Proportions and Symmetry. 5 Examine NaN Values Great So there are no NaN values. Wait Do you see the Min. As we can t feed String data for Modelling. Qualitative Features Categorical Cut Color Clarity. Diamonds are Rare because of the Incredibly powerful forces needed to create them. An Inclusion is an Imperfection located within a Diamond. jpg Color vs Price 3. Feature Scaling there_you_go_6 7. The middle line of the box is the median or the 50 percentile. Click Here to Learn More about How Carat Affects the Price of Diamonds. com diamond education diamond cut https i. Collect all R2 Scores. png Carat vs Price It seems that Carat varies with Price Exponentially. com grading depth and table values We can Infer from the plot that the Price can vary heavily for the same Depth. The side lines of the box are the 25 and 75 percentiles respectively. com Chinmayrane16 Diamonds In Depth Analysis Do Upvote if you like it Topics1. The Price of the Diamond is highly correlated to Carat and its Dimensions. We can see there are 20 rows with Dimensions Zero. 2 Extract Dataset Specify the location to the Dataset and Import them. com blog 2014 10 23 how carat weight affects diamond price https i. Let s Have a look at them. Why are Diamonds so Valuable Whether it is a Rare book a fine bottle of Scotch or a Diamond something that is Rare and Unique is often expensive. Visualizations there_you_go_3 4. Table The Width of the Diamond s Table expressed as a Percentage of its Average Diameter. 7 Scaling of all Features The Values are Distributed over a Small Scale. We ll Drop them as it seems better choice instead of filling them with any of Mean or Median 1. jpg Cut vs Price Premium Cut on Diamonds as we can see are the most Expensive followed by Excellent Very Good Cut. Correlation Map Visualize via kde plots Understanding Box Plot The bottom line indicates the min value of Age. If it is too Small then the light will get Trapped and that Attention grabbing shaft of light will never come out but will leak from other places in the Diamond. 4 Ridge Regression 7. The carat of a Diamond is often very Important to People when shopping But it is a Mistake to Sacrifice too much quality for sheer size. Colorless Diamonds are Rarer and more Valuable because they appear Whiter and Brighter. 3 Features Carat Carat weight of the Diamond. Values of X Y and Z. The Weight Carat of a diamond has the most significant impact on its Price. If a Diamond s Depth Percentage is too large or small the Diamond will become Dark in appearance because it will no longer return an Attractive amount of light. 7 KNeighbours Regression Tuning Parameters 8 Visualizing R2 Score of Algorithms Random Forest Regressor gives us the highest R2 Score 98. 7 Dimensions As the Dimensions increases Obviously the Prices Rises as more and more Natural Resources are Utilised. Since the larger a stone is the Rarer it is one 2 carat diamond will be more __Expensive__ than the total cost of two 1 Carat Diamonds of the same Quality. 1 Linear Regression 7. Exploring Dataset there_you_go_1 2. It includes scratches extra facets etc. With a Higher Cut Quality the Diamond s Cost per Carat Increases. Let s Confirm just to visualize. Since the larger a Stone is the Rarer it is one 2 Carat Diamond will be more Expensive than the Total cost of two 1 Carat Diamonds of the Same Quality. 2 Drop X Y Z 5 Feature Encoding Label the Categorical Features with digits to Distinguish. Comparing R2 Scores there_you_go_8 What are Diamonds Diamonds are the Precious stone consisting of a clear and colourless Crystalline form of pure carbon. jpg It seems that VS1 and VS2 affect the Diamond s Price equally having quite high Price margin. Click Here to Learn More about How Table Affects the Price of Diamonds. 6 Dropping Rows with Dimensions Zero. 2 Cut Although the Carat Weight of a Diamond has the Strongest Effect on Prices the Cut can still Drastically Increase or Decrease its value. 6 Feature Scaling Divide the Dataset into Train and Test So that we can fit the Train for Modelling Algos and Predict on Test. com grading depth and table values 3. Depth is inversely related to Price. 5 Depth The Depth of a Diamond is its Height in millimeters measured from the Culet to the Table. 3 Color The Color of a Diamond refers to the Tone and Saturation of Color or the Depth of Color in a Diamond. 6 Table Table is the Width of the Diamond s Table expressed as a Percentage of its Average Diameter. Obviously in that part of the Earth it s very hot. 4 Clarity Diamond Clarity refers to the absence of the Inclusions and Blemishes. Click Here to Learn More about How Clarity Affects the Price of Diamonds. The Color of a Diamond can Range from Colorless to a Yellow or a Faint Brownish Colored hue. Price is the Target Variable. This is because if a Diamond s Depth percentage is too large or small the Diamond will become __Dark__ in appearance because it will no longer return an Attractive amount of light. The Weight of a Diamond has the most significant Impact on its Price. 2 Correlation Between Features CONCLUSIONS 1. Price the Price of the Diamond. In order from Best to Worst FL flawless I3 level 3 inclusions FL IF VVS1 VVS2 VS1 VS2 SI1 SI2 I1 I2 I3 Depth The Height of a Diamond measured from the Culet to the table divided by its average Girdle Diameter. It doesn t make any sense to have either of Length or Width or Height to be zero. com education understanding diamond color https i. Quantitative Features Numerical Carat Depth Table Price X Y Z. If the Table Upper Flat Facet is too Large then light will not play off of any of the Crown s angles or facets and will not create the Sparkly Rainbow Colors.
