Epithelial cells that are significantly enlarged may be a malignant cell. In cancer cells the chromatin tends to be more coarse. cell_size_uniformity 1 10. Cancer cells tend to lose this ability. The first fold is kept for testing and the model is trained on k 1 folds. single_epithelial_cell_size 1 10. That is why these parameters are valuable in determining whether the cells are cancerous or not. mitoses 1 10. It is related to the uniformity mentioned above. Nucleoli are small structures seen in the nucleus. Describes a uniform texture of the nucleus seen in benign cells. Benign cells tend to be grouped in monolayers while cancerous cells are often grouped in multilayers. Those are typically seen in benign tumors. In normal cells the nucleolus is usually very small if visible at all. In cancer cells the nucleoli become more prominent and sometimes there are more of them. Class 0 or 1.
