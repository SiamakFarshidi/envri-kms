Two of the most effective policy procedures to prevent infections of SARS CoV would be to apply stringent precautionary measures and to impose quicker and more effective quarantine of the exposed populace PMC_ID PMC1732706.

Another study reported that the impact of COVID 19 infection on pregnant women appears to be less severe. Based on our results for other tasks health care workers also have a higher risk of infection due to close contact with patients. sumSq x x self. Co infection was less likely with increasing age which may be a consequence of pre existing immunity or decreased viral shedding with increasing age PMC_ID PMC6625191. H1N1 patients coinfected with rhinovirus had less severe disease while non rhinovirus co infections were associated with substantially higher severity without changes in influenza viral titer PMC_ID PMC3153592. Used autoencoder to learn a lower dimensional latent space representation of the concatenated vector. Both SARS coronavirus and H7N9 viruses presented a global epidemic threat but the social and economic impacts of H7N9 were not as serious as in the case of SARS because the response to H7N9 was more effective PMC_ID PMC6046118. In coding it s okay to try fail and try again. The assumption is that the concatendate vector shoul have a manifold shaep in the high dimensional space.

There is no evidence suggesting transplacental transmission based on very limited data as the analysis of amniotic fluid cord blood neonatal throat swab and breast milk samples available from six of the nine patients were found to be negative for COVID 19.

Respiratory viruses rarely reach their epidemic peak concurrently and there appears to be a negative association between infection with one respiratory virus and co infection with another PMC_ID PMC6625191.
