I personally prefer the Indic NLP transliterations seems more accurate to me but you could test of both the packages and decide what you think is suitable. Evaluation metric Word level Jaccard score. Tokens are separated using whitespace characters or punctuation characters. Note that Indic NLP provides two types of transliterations one is using Itrans and the other one makes use of BrahmiNet API. csv the training set containing context questions and answers. Tokenization is supported for Tamil by Indic NLP this is a python based open source library. This enables the pipeline to treat the past and present tense of a verb for example as the same word instead of two completely different words. The earliest extant text in Tamil is the Tolk\u0101ppiyam a work on poetics and grammar which describes the language of the classical period the oldest portions of this book may date back to around 200 BCE Hart 1975. In Sri Lanka the standard is based on the dialect of Jaffna. Spoken predominantly by Tamils in India Sri Lanka Malaysia and Singapore it has smaller communities of speakers in many other countries. Unlike translation which gives the meaning of a given word in a different language transliteration represents the characters of a given script to characters of another and only gives an idea on how that word is pronounced. com uc id 1ds8UZQdbRYPGMJ9WdcG5c1K0pRgg20U7 Problem Statement Goal To predict answers to questions for wikipedia articles in Hindi and Tamil. In recent times however koduntamil has been making inroads into areas that have traditionally been considered the province of centamil. The lower the distance the more similar the two strings. You can learn more about W B artifacts here https docs. Such a language needs deeper analysis at the word level to capture the meaning of the word from its morphemes and its categories. Thus the word for here ingu in Centamil the classic variety has evolved into inge in the Kongu dialect of Coimbatore inga in the dialect of Thanjavur ingane in the dialect of Tirunelveli inguttu in the dialect of Ramanathapuram ingale and ingade in various northern dialects and ingai in some dialects of Sri Lanka. Transliteration is an optional module this again depends on your system and what you are trying to achieve. External chronological records and internal linguistic evidence however indicate that the oldest extant works were probably composed sometime in the 2nd century CE. Several castes have their own dialects which most members of that caste traditionally used regardless of where they come from. Diglossia has existed in the language since ancient times the language used in early temple inscriptions differs quite significantly from the language of classical poetry. The dialect of the Iyers of Palakkad has a large number of Malayalam loanwords has also been influenced by Malayalam syntax and also has a distinct Malayalam accent. In India the standard koduntamil is based on educated non brahmin speech rather than on any one dialect Schiffman 1998 but has been significantly influenced by the dialects of Thanjavur and Madurai.

History The origins of Tamil like the other Dravidian languages are unknown but unlike most of the other established literary languages of India are independent of Sanskrit. Jaccard Distance is a measure of how dissimilar two sets are. Generally the process of tokenization happens at word level but sometimes it s tough to define what s meant by a word. Files train. The dialects spoken in Sri Lanka retain many words that are not in everyday use in India and use many other words slightly differently. Its important to understand the history and orgins of the language and how much spoken tamil differs from written text. com uc id 1k1aZiQxli20hUMtKq9 cr2DkJmKbprjC DialectsTamil dialects are mainly differentiated from each other by the fact that they have undergone different phonological changes and sound shifts in evolving from Old Tamil. com uc id 1pQPKmmjtnSGiVhnUVvuItYVl4vE1k47Z Tokenization Tamil Tokenization is the process of breaking a stream of textual content into meaningful elements called tokens. Artifact references can be used to point to data in other systems like S3 GCP or your own system. Jaccard Distance depends on another concept called Jaccard Similarity Index which is the number in both sets the number in either set 100. csv a sample submission file in the correct format Columns id a unique identifier context the text of the Hindi Tamil sample from which answers should be derived question the question in Hindi Tamil answer_text train only the answer to the question manual annotation note for test this is what you are attempting to predict answer_start train only the starting character in context for the answer determined using substring match during data preparation language whether the text in question is in Tamil or Hindi Note There is also a hidden test set. Contiguous strings of alphabetic characters or numbers are considered as a single token. Linguists categorise Tamil literature and language into three periods ancient 500 BCE to 700 CE medieval 700 CE to 1500 CE and modern 1500 CE to the present. Standard tokenizers use simple heuristics like Punctuations and whitespace may or may not be returned with the tokens. Stop words are considered as irrelevant for searching and retrieval purposed since they occur frequently and does not add any additional sense about the query s context. com uc id 1PAhaiNQMySMWuAdAtmfOrCzlixyJYI0z Inspiration https www.

These tokens can be words terms symbols etc. A possible use case would be when phrases which cannot be translated are encountered these are considered as Out of Vocabulary terms OOV. Some of these differences have begun to fade away in recent years as a result of the anti casteist movement but many traces remain and it is often possible to identify a person s caste by their speech. Tamil Lemmatizer from John Snow Labs is a dictionary based lemmatizer that assigns all forms and inflections of a word to a single root. Also includes the start character of the answer for disambiguation. Apart from these the earliest examples of Tamil writing we have today are rock inscriptions from the 3rd century BCE which are written in Tamil Brahmi an adapted form of the Brahmi script Mahadevan 2003.

Finally the Sanketi Hebbar and Mandyam dialects the former spoken by groups of Tamil Iyers and the latter two by Vaishnavites who migrated to Karnataka in the 11th century retains many features of the Vaishnava paribasai a special form of Tamil designed in the 9th and 10th centuries to reflect Vaishnavite religious and spiritual values. Tamil dialects vary according to both region and community. In modern times centamil is generally used in formal writing and speech. In Natural Language Processing NLP these useless terms words are referred to as stop words. In consequence standard centamil is not based on the speech of any one region a fact which has helped keep the written language mostly the same across various Tamil speaking regions. Bangalore also has its own version of Tamil and is mainly spoken by the people whose mother tongue is not Tamil and infuses words from Kannada and even Hindi. com 2019 03 31 text preprocessing tools for tamil language code snippet for jaccard score calculation download the resource The path to the local git repo for Indic NLP library The path to the local git repo for Indic NLP Resources Add library to Python path Set environment variable for resources folder Save preprocessed train data to W B Artifacts add a few features relative position of answer in context show basic stats of new features plot distributions of new features Log Plots to W B environment for feature in new_features Create an instance of the PairGrid class.
