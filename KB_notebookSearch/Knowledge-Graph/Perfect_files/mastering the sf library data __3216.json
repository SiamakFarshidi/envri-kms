The enrollment boom in 2003 is most probably due to the transition to the digital archiving. However 2003 and 2016 are the two outliers. Hi All In this notebook I am trying to understand which parameters are correlated with each other and library activity. Thanks for checking this Billur What attributes are most associated with library activity of checkouts of renewals I suspect that the year of enrolment would be correlated with library activity first let s see what is the distribution of member enrolments per year. Let s see we are right the 2016 records are upto July. Patron Type groups are formed regarding the Age and senior people had more chance to checkout renew books compared to the younger peers. As we can see from the below listed articles the home prices http www. 29 correlation between Total Renewal and Registration Year Even though the majority of the members have relatively low library activity when we filter out the less active members such as members with renewal 2000 xor checkout 5000 the correlations get weaker. gov Publications Report 3305 2. The number of enrolled Patrons has an increasing trend over the years. Outside of Country is related with Year Patron Registered. We observe a dramatic increase in the number of Outside Country registrations after 2011. com uploads chorus_asset file 4558025 5 15_SF New Housing Units Completed_since 1995. The enrolment decay in 2016 may be explained by the records being incomplete. This one deserves a closer look The artificial 2003 increase in the number of Patrons Registered is probably due to the initial recording of the previous Patrons.

Older people may be registered earlier than the toddlers for example or family may have registered later than the seniors. This year corresponds to the end of recession and the economic recovery. then lets see how the library activity is distributed over the yearsAs one can see from the above 2 plots and the correlation grid below there is 0. org sites default files wysiwyg u150 bay area job trends. Age is more or less weakly correlated with everything. Apart from that Age is highly negatively correlated with Year Patron Registered which makes sense. png 2 and the number of new constructions completed https cdn3. That s why we will keep all membersLet s assign a representative numerical age per Age Range and check the correlation between every parameter in our dataset As expected the most correlated parameter couple is Total Checkout and Total Renewals. png 1 job trends http www. These changes may point to an increased immigration to San Francisco and thus may explain the increased number of Outside of Country Patrons. 36 correlation between Total Checkout and Registration Year 0. jpg all start to increase.
