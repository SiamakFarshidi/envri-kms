Here we are only provided with image level labels. The green filter should hence be used to predict the label and the other filters are used as references. io en latest py_tutorials py_imgproc py_thresholding py_thresholding. do a max pooling with filter 2x2 stride of 2 for downsampling Repeat it for 5 steps Then perform up conv Cell Segmenation https github. Golgi apparatus 8. About 99 of images have at most 3 labels and 88. Nuclear membrane 2. Mitotic spindle 12. Aggresome 16. Each file represents a different filter on the subcellular protein patterns represented by the sample. Few important points about the problem. Since this is a multi label problem each image is given a set of labels. Vesicles and punctate cytosolic patterns 18. Endoplasmic reticulum 7. Nuclear speckles 5. Intermediate filaments 9. Centrosome 13. html otsus binarization. This is a weakly supervised multi label classification problem. Plasma membrane 14. Vizualize RGB images for each class of the label U Net from scratch The u net is convolutional network architecture for fast and precise segmentation of images. Cytosol 17. Nuclear bodies 6. Labels 0. Mitochondria 15. Nucleoplasm 1. com CellProfiling HPA Cell Segmentation can be used to extract segment masks for each cell. To study more about Otsu s Binarization go to this link https opencv python tutroals. Weakly supervised learning is a machine learning framework where the model is trained using examples that are only partially annotated or labeled. Negative Import Libraries Converting multi labels in one hot encodings Number of Images per Label Observation from above Images with Nucleoplasm label are highest in number 8497 Negative labelled images are quite low 34 About 50 of the images consists of 3 labels Nucleoplasm Cytosol Plasma membrane Number of labels per image Observation from above About 10412 images have only one label. 7 of images have at most 2 labels. Train Image datasetBelow images are images related to specific channelsThe reference for the above is taken from this https www. Otsu s binarization automatically calculates a threshold value from image histogram for a bimodal image. png for the PNG files. Microtubules 11. Nucleoli fibrillar center 4. U net was used for segmenting biomedical images in the original paper. reset seaborn style creating custom color map taking the picture for endoplasmic reticulum global thresholding Otsu s thresholding Otsu s thresholding after Gaussian filtering plot all the images and their histograms encoder decoder all the x s are passed in the decoder part too x4 is 64x64 x is 56x56 we need to crop x4 to same size as x. com jschnab exploring the human protein atlas images notebook Thresholded images across all the 4 channels Thresholding images across all 4 channels with Grey color map Otsu s Binarization In the above thresholding method a specific threshold was choosen arbitrary. The format should be filename _ filter color. Colors are red for microtubule channels blue for nuclei channels yellow for Endoplasmic Reticulum ER channels and green for the protein of interest. Cytosol and mitochondria are also correlated to some extent. Each sample consists of four files. Following are the index to label mappings used for this problem. Following are the steps that can be followed here conv 3x3 applied 2 times followed by RelU. Nucleoli 3.
