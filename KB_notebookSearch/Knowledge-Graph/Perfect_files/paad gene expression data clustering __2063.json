Data Cleaning and Analysis 4367 genes have NaN values across different coloumns as seen above Standardisation PCA Analysis About Variance and analysis It is clear that this dataset contains various tumour types tabulated based on various metadata fields. png in output Find. But there are also tumor types having distinguishable variances as seen from the values above. Introduction Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma PAAD is the third most common cause of death from cancer with an overall 5 year survival rate of less than 5 and is predicted to become the second leading cause of cancer mortality in the United States by 2030 Here we re trying to understand the gene expression distribution for all samples and what the analysis say about the general behaviour of different samples. This means there are many tumor types in this dataset which are almost indistinguishable from each other which might fall into different variations of same types. png in output Neuroendocrine tumor types are distinguishable from the Adenocarcinoma tumors as it is seen in the PCA plot generated and also from other ones. com kaggle docker python For example here s several helpful packages to load linear algebra data processing CSV file I O e. read_csv Input data files are available in the read only. input directory For example running this by clicking run or pressing Shift Enter will list all files under the input directory You can write up to 20GB to the current directory kaggle working that gets preserved as output when you create a version using Save Run All You can also write temporary files to kaggle temp but they won t be saved outside of the current session Identifying the null values Get the component variance Proportion of Variance from PC1 to PC183 Cumulative proportion of variance from PC1 to PC183 Get component loadings correlation coefficient between original variables and the component Get correlation matrix plot for loadings Get PCA loadings plots 2D 3D Removing rows containing NaN values Trial Example size. Proportion of variance for the initial PC components is above 90 after which it gets reduced drastically to a range of 10 1. After that unsupervised clustering on the gene expression data is done to identify the correlations of the clusters so formed with the sample metadata. K Means Clustering This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed It is defined by the kaggle python Docker image https github. For this we re applying dimensionality reduction techniques PCA to find these two groups within this multi dimensional data. We also want to stratify these tumor samples by the type of pancreatic cancer they exhibit. shown by many tumor types.
