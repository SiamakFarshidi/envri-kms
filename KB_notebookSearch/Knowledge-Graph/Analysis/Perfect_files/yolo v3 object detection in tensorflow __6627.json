What is Yolo Yolo is an algorithm that uses convolutional neural networks for object detection. Sample images DetectionsTesting the model with IoU Interception over Union ratio used in non max suppression threshold and confidence threshold both set to 0. 02767 A Tensorflow Slim implementation https github. We omit the last 3 layers Avgpool Connected and Softmax since we only need the features. Skip first 5 values containing irrelevant info Load weights for Darknet part. moving_average momentum moving_average 1 momentum current_average Leaky ReLULeaky ReLU is a slight modification of ReLU activation function. The code is available on my GitHub repo https github. We are going to predict the width and height of the box as offsets from cluster centroids. It s useful to group them in blocks. Upsample layerIn order to concatenate with shortcut outputs from Darknet 53 before applying detection on a different scale we are going to upsample the feature map using nearest neighbor interpolation. DependenciesTo build Yolo we re going to need Tensorflow deep learning NumPy numerical computation and Pillow image processing libraries. What is Yolo 1 2. Detection layersYolo has 3 detection layers that detect on 3 different scales using respective anchors. Finally let s import IPython function display to display images in the notebook. com devicehive devicehive video analysis A Street Walk in Shinjuku Tokyo Japan https www. Running the modelNow we can run the model using some sample images. Convolution layersYolo has a large number of convolutional layers. For each cell in the feature map the detection layer predicts n_anchors 5 n_classes values using 1x1 convolution. Acknowledgements 10 1. Utility functions 5 6. Also we re going to use seaborn s color palette for bounding boxes colors. Each convolution layer has batch normalization. Model definiton 4 5. org files 005 d19 2bd 005d192bd6274c298f75896498aea377. Let s look at other parameters step by step. We use them in forward propagation during inference after training. AnchorsAnchors are sort of bounding box priors that were calculated on the COCO dataset using k means clustering. To Do list Training 10. com mystic123 tensorflow yolo v3 ResNet official implementation https github. com vi yQwfDxBMtXg maxresdefault. The center coordinates of the box relative to the location of filter application are predicted using a sigmoid function. com watch v kZ7caIK4RXI Special thanks to Paul https www. 7th 15th and 23rd convolution layer has biases and no batch norm. Model hyperparametersNext we define some configurations for Yolo. com wp content uploads 2018 02 prelu. For each scale we have n_anchors 3. Also same as ResNet Yolo uses convolution with fixed padding which means that padding is defined only by the size of the kernel. Feature extraction Darknet 53For feature extraction Yolo uses Darknet 53 neural net pretrained on ImageNet. Running the model 7 8. Acknowledgements Yolo v3 official paper https arxiv. b_ x sigma t_ x c_ x b_ y sigma t_ y c_ y b_ w p_ w e t_ w b_ h p_ h e t_ h Where b_ x and b_ y are the center coordinates of the box b_ w and b_ h are the width and height of the box c_ x and c_ y are the location of filter application and t_ i are predicted during regression. _MODEL_SIZE refers to the input size of the model. Batch norm and fixed paddingIt s useful to define batch_norm function since the model uses batch norms with shared parameters heavily. com heartkilla yolo v3 blob master data detection_examples detections. com paultimothymooney for posting this kernel in Kaggle Data Notes Newsletter https www. com watch v kZ7caIK4RXI https github. A Street Walk in Shinjuku Tokyo Japan https www. Video processingI also applied the same algorithm to video detections. png _BATCH_NORM_EPSILON refers to epsilon in this formula whereas _BATCH_NORM_DECAY refers to momentum which is used for computing moving average and variance. Yolo v3 Object Detection in Tensorflow GitHub repo link https github. Loading weights for Yolo part. com heartkilla yolo v3. Batch normalization is defined as follows. Non max suppressionThe model is going to produce a lot of boxes so we need a way to discard the boxes with low confidence scores. So what s great about object detection In comparison to recognition algorithms a detection algorithm does not only predict class labels but detects locations of objects as well. com heartkilla yolo v3 UPDATE Video processing Content1. Final model classFinally let s define the model class using all of the layers described previously. com tensorflow models tree master official resnet DeviceHive video analysis repo https github. 5 n_classes means that respectively to each of 3 anchors we are going to predict 4 coordinates of the box its confidence score the probability of containing an object and class probabilities. Utility functionsHere are some utility functions that will help us load images as NumPy arrays load class names from the official file and draw the predicted boxes. jpg resize 300 2C201 ssl 1 _LEAKY_RELU refers to alpha. Same as ResNet Darknet 53 has shortcut residual connections which help information from earlier layers flow further. Converting weights to Tensorflow formatNow it s time to load the official weights. The idea behind Leaky ReLU is to prevent so called neuron dying when a large number of activations become 0. Here is an example of applying Yolo to a video I found on YouTube. Video processing 8 9. Model definitionI refered to the official ResNet implementation in Tensorflow in terms of how to arange the code. We are going to iterate through the file and gradually create tf. It helps the model train faster and reduces variance between units and total variance as well. Batch normalizationAlmost every convolutional layer in Yolo has batch normalization after it. Converting weights to Tensorflow format 6 7. Also to avoid having multiple boxes for one object we will discard the boxes with high overlap as well using non max suppresion for each class.
