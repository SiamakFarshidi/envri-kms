Make sure to not include input_dim and include MaxPooling step. Convolution operation2. initialize the classifier CNN Please note that there is another way to build a mode Functional API. Compile and fit the model4. io preprocessing image. Softmax Cross entropySoftmax function brings all predicted values to be between 0 and 1 and make them add up to 1. I added some useful notes along the way to clarify things. Instead Cross Entropy should be used to measure how good the model is as there can be two models that produce same results while one produced better percentages than the other. Repaet this step until all the pixels are evaluated. Max PoolingTake a 2 x 2 box on the top left corner starting here and record the maximum number within the box. classic ANN full connection common practice number of hidden nodes between the number of input nodes and output nodes and choose powers of 2 Data augmentation. To learn more about this function refer to this guide https keras. Add more fully connected layer hidden layers Catches more complex behaviors Thank you for reading this kernel. Make predictions and determine accuracy Below are key concepts used in Convolutional Neural Networks. Add more convolutional layers This will allow more features to be detected prior to fitting to ANN. And in each folder cat images and dog images should be placed in two separate folders. Build the Keras model3. Flattening should be at the end of all the layers. If it is one we are moving it one pixel each time and recording the value adding up all the multiplied values. FlatteningFlatten the matrix into a long vector which will be the input to the artificial neural network Full ConnectionImplement full Artificial Neural Network model to optimize weights. 3 x 3 feature detector is commonly used but other sizes can be used. Fit the model on images image preprocessingData augmentation prevents overfitting by generating more samples of the images through flipping rotating distorting etc. If you found this helpful please upvote the kernel or put a short comment below. This notebook s content is from A Z Datascience course and I hope this will be useful to those who want to review materials covered or anyone who wants to learn the basics of CNN. ReLUAfter feature detectors are applied upon images ReLU is used to increase non linearity within images. Flattening creating a long vector. no parameters needed. Videos are three dimenstional with time. To be able to work with keras library we need proper structure of images. We will create a dog vs cat classifier. Other pooling techniques are also available such as Mean Pooling which takes the average of pixels within the box. Build the CNN model 2. Keras has built in Image Augmentation function. applying convolution operation build the convolutional layer 32 3 3 32 filters with 3 x 3 for each filter. But when using CPU 3 64 64 due to computational limitation Max Pooling create a pooling layer 2 x 2 size commonly used to keep much information. So after applying convolution operation to images than pooling is applied. Aim of max pooling is to keep all the important features even if images have spatial or textual distortions and also reduce the size which prevents overfitting. Improving the modelThere are two possible ways of reducing variane which is making the model fit more to the train set. start with 32 filters and then create more layers with 64 128 256 etc expected format of the images. Content Explanation1. Full connectionSoftmax Cross entropy IMPLEMENTATION1. Compile the model 3. Just seeing how many wrong predictions the classifier made is not enough to evaluate the performance of ANNs. Convolutional Neural Networks CNN KerasCreated by Sangwook CheonDate Dec 31 2018Updated Jun 27 2019This is step by step guide to Convolutional Neural Network CNN which I created for reference. Stride is the number of pixels with which we slide the detector. Many feature detectors are used and the algorithm finds out what is the optimal way to filter images. Convolution OperationThe aim of convolution operation is to reduce the size of an image by using feature detectors that keep only the specific patterns within the image. It also comes hand in hand with cross entropy method. In this way keras will understand how to work with them. 256 256 3 3 color channels RGB 256 x 256 pixels. There should be two folders Test set and Train set. For classificaion Cross Entropy should be used and for regression Mean Squared Error should be used. Slide it to the right with the stride of 2 commonly used and move onto the next row if completed.
