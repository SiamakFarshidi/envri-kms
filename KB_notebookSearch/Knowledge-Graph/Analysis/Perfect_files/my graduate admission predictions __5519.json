From the data shown below it appears the submissions are normally distributed. Research Let s explore how many applicants have research experience. So let s find the mean chance of admission and transform the Chance to Admit column to binary values. GRE Score The Graduate Record Examination is a standarized exam often required for admission to graduate and MBA programs globally. Random Forest Classification Logistic Regression Our data contains the chance to admit which is a float value we should classify the chance of a student s admission as a binary value accepted and not accepted. It gave me some practice some exploratory analysis and simple machine learning techniques. It seems the majority of applicants have research experience. Two columns also have an added space in the label which we ll take outLet s plot a heatmap to see the correlation of all the features compared to Chance to Admit The top three features that affect the Chance to Admit are 1. The mean is 317 with a standard deviation of 11. GRE Score vs Chance of Admit GRE scores have a strong correlation with the chance of admission however not as strong as one s CGPA. It s made up of three components 1. Decision Trees Random Forests Comparing Scores Let s put all the scores in a table and display their scores side by side. Verbal Reasoning Scored on a 130 170 scale 3. However this is the least important feature so it doesn t matter all too much if an applicant has the experience or not. 6 and standard deviation of 0. We ll also scale our data from 0 to 1 to receive more accurate predictions. TOEFL Score The Test of English as a Foreign Language is a standarized test for non native English speakers that are choosing to enroll in English speaking universities. We ll use multiple techniques and eventually select the method with the best score. In this dataset the TOEFL scores have a mean of 107 and a standard deviation of 6. CGPA The Cumulative Grade Point Average is a 10 point grading system. First we have to prepare our data by splitting it into training and testing data. The test is split up into 4 sections 1. Conclusion This was a great way to get started on Kaggle and for my first project outside of coursework. University Rating Let s see the distribution of applicants coming from each kind of university. The objective is to explore what kind of data is provided determine the most important factors that contribute to a student s chance of admission and select the most accurate model to predict the probability of admission. For my curiosity I want to explore the data a little bit further regarding research and university rankings. The methods used will be 1. TOEFL Score vs Chance of Admit Like GRE scores the scores received for the TOEFL strongly correlate to an applicants chance of admission. TOEFL ScoreLet s explore these three features to get a better understanding. 5 It seems that Logistic Regression and Random Forests are the most accurate methods and will be used to predict the future applicant s chances of admission. is just an index for students which we can take out. Logistic Regression 96. Data Description The dataset contains information about a student s GRE Score TOEFL Score University Ratings Statement of Purpose Score Letter of Recomendation Score CGPA Whether the Student Has Done Any Research Chance of Admission What We re Trying to Predict Importing Libraries and Data Importing libraries and setting the default style in Seaborn. Exploratory Analysis From these charts it looks like we have no missing values It seems as though Serial No. Decision Tree Classification3. Graduate Admission Analysis for UCLA Introduction Objective 400 applicants have been surveyed as potential students for UCLA. Even though they hold a lower importance in the chance of admission it would be nice to understand their characteristics in the dataset. If not they will not be accepted. To transform the chance to admit to binary values we ll assume that if the student s chance is above the mean they are accepted. Analytical Writing Scored on a 0 6 scale in half point increments 2. WritingAll sections are scored out of 30 giving the exam a total score of 120 marks. Next let s import our dataset and see what we re working with. Machine Learning The end goal is to determine if an applicant will be admitted to the univeristy or not. Preparing Data for Machine Learning Now that we understand our dataset it s time to implement machine learning methods to predict future applicant s chances of admission. It s great to see what specific variables contribute to the chance of admission and how they are weighted against eachother. Logistic Regression2. Most applicants come from a tier 3 and tier 2 university. Quantitative Reasoning Scored on a 130 170 scale In this dataset the GRE Score is based on a maximum of 340 points. CGPA vs Chance of Admit It appears as applicant s CGPA has a strong correlation with their chance of admission. The university weighs certain aspects of a student s education to determine their acceptance. Therefore this is a classification case.
