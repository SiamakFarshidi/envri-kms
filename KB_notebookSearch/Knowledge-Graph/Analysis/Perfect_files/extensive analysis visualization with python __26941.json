The non graphical methods are quantitative and objective. The KDE plot plots the density of observations on one axis with height along the other axis. These are simple functions that return a boolean value indicating whether the passed in argument value is in fact missing data. So I will compute the standard correlation coefficient also called Pearson s r between every pair of attributes. target variable contains two integer values 1 and 0 1 Presence of heart disease 0 Absence of heart disease So the above analysis gives target variable values categorized into presence and absence of heart disease and groupby cp variable values. Analysis of age and other variables Check the number of unique values in age variable View statistical summary of age variable Interpretation The mean value of the age variable is 54. We can see that the thalach variable is slightly negatively skewed. The non graphical methods provide insight into the characteristics and the distribution of the variable s of interest. Hence it is confirmed that there are no missing or negative values in the dataset. Deaths at a given age from CVD are more common and have been increasing in much of the developing world while rates have declined in most of the developed world since the 1970s. Interpretation The above line shows that linear regression model is not good fit to the data. We can add jitter to bring out the distribution of values as follows Visualize distribution of thalach variable wrt target with boxplot InterpretationThe above boxplot confirms our finding that people suffering from heart disease target 1 have relatively higher heart rate thalach as compared to people who are not suffering from heart disease target 0. Now we can see that the dataset contains 303 instances and 14 variables. NaN NaN an acronym for Not a Number is a special floating point value recognized by all systems that use the standard IEEE floating point representation. 7 View column names 6. So there are 165 patients suffering from heart disease. Similarly 0 stands for absence of heart disease. We can plot a histogram as follows Visualize frequency distribution of thalach variable wrt target Interpretation We can see that those people suffering from heart disease target 1 have relatively higher heart rate thalach as compared to people who are not suffering from heart disease target 0. If the column contains missing values then it returns TRUE otherwise FALSE. 1 So friends our EDA journey has come to an end. mean It returns percentage of missing values in each column in the dataframe. chol variable also contains outliers to the right side. In this kernel we have implemented many of the strategies presented in the book Think Stats Exploratory Data Analysis in Python by Allen B Downey. So in this kernel I have conducted Exploratory Data Analysis or EDA of the heart disease dataset. So there is no correlation between target and fbs. 1 EDA is generally cross classified in two ways. target variable also contains two integer values 1 and 0 1 Presence of heart disease 0 Absence of heart disease The above plot confirms our findings that Out of 96 females 72 have heart disease and 24 do not have heart disease. 3 Dataset description 6. any It returns a boolean value indicating whether the dataframe has missing values or not. Conclusion Back to Table of Contents 0. It refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. Dealing with missing values 10 Pandas isnull and notnull functions 10. Those variables containing outliers needs further investigation. So we can see that there is no variable which has strong negative correlation with target variable. I think it is more convinient way of interpret the plots. To get an overview of the distribution of the dataset. Bivariate analysis 8 Estimate correlation coefficients 8. Plot the distribution of age variableNow I will plot the distribution of age variable to view the statistical properties. describe include all View column names 7. target and oldpeak variable are also mildly negatively correlated correlation coefficient 0. References Back to Table of Contents 0. So in this section I will analyze the target variable. Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally. Import libraries Back to Table of Contents 0. We can see that the cp and thalach variables are mildly positively correlated with target variable. oldpeak variable contains outliers to the right side. Similarly out of 207 males 93 have heart disease and 114 do not have heart disease. Together CVD resulted in 17. The below list shed light on some of these questions What is the distribution of the dataset Are there any missing numerical values outliers or anomalies in the dataset What are the underlying assumptions in the dataset Whether there exists relationships between variables in the dataset How to be sure that our dataset is ready for input in a machine learning algorithm How to select the most suitable algorithm for a given dataset So how do we get answer to the above questions The answer is Exploratory Data Analysis. I have imported the libraries. 1 Analysis of target feature variable Our feature variable of interest is target. Interpretation The above scatter plot shows that there is no correlation between age and trestbps variable. This gives us confidence that our code is running properly. target variable also contains two integer values 1 and 0 1 Presence of heart disease 0 Absence of heart disease So out of 96 females 72 have heart disease and 24 do not have heart disease. Hence it is numerical variable. Hence it is a categorical variable. Objectives of EDA Back to Table of Contents 0. 1 Useful commands to detect missing values 10. It is integer valued as it contains two integers 0 and 1 0 stands for absence of heart disease and 1 for presence of heart disease. Objectives of EDA 2 1. Discover patterns and relationships between variables in the dataset. Second each method is either univariate or multivariate usually bivariate. Findings of Bivariate Analysis Findings of Bivariate Analysis are as follows There is no variable which has strong positive correlation with target variable. Check for missing numerical values outliers or other anomalies in the dataset. Out of 96 females 72 have heart disease and 24 do not have heart disease. Outlier detection is also a part of this analysis. There is no variable which has strong negative correlation with target variable. The people suffering from heart disease target 1 have relatively higher heart rate thalach as compared to people who are not suffering from heart disease target 0. age variable Box plot of age variable trestbps variable Box plot of trestbps variable chol variable Box plot of chol variable thalach variable Box plot of thalach variable oldpeak variable Box plot of oldpeak variable Findings The age variable does not contain any outlier. If dataframe contains missing values it returns TRUE and FALSE otherwise. Multivariate analysis Back to Table of Contents 0. We have also discussed how to detect missing data and outliers. Multivariate non graphical EDAMultivariate non graphical EDA techniques show the relationship between two or more variables in the form of either cross tabulation or statistics. Interpretation The age variable distribution is approximately normal. So your upvote would be highly appreciated. Analyze age and trestbps variableI will plot a scatterplot to visualize the relationship between age and trestbps variable. Introduction to EDA Back to Table of Contents 0. Below I will list some useful commands to deal with missing values. target and thal variable are also waekly negatively correlated correlation coefficient 0. Check shape of the dataset It is a good idea to first check the shape of the dataset. corr method as follows The target variable is target. Exploratory data analysis 6 Check shape of the dataset 6. Analyze age and chol variable Interpretation The above plot confirms that there is a slighly positive correlation between age and chol variables. Types of EDA Back to Table of Contents 0. info command gives us the number of filled values along with the data types of columns. Frequency distribution of target variable wrt sex Comment sex variable contains two integer values 1 and 0 1 male 0 female. target and ca variable are weakly negatively correlated correlation coefficient 0. target and exang variable are mildly negatively correlated correlation coefficient 0. First of all I will draw a heat map. They do not give full picture of the data. It excludes character variables. Univariate non graphical EDAThe objective of the univariate non graphical EDA is to understand the sample distribution and also to make some initial conclusions about population distributions. The cp and thalach variables are mildly positively correlated with target variable. exang exercise induced angina should also be a character variable as it contains only 0 and 1 as values 1 yes 0 no. Statistical properties of dataset Important points to note The above command df. I will visualize its frequency distribution of values as follows Visualize the frequency distribution of thalach variable Comment We can see that the thalach variable is slightly negatively skewed. If we simply want to check the data type of a particular column we can use the following command. any It checks whether a particular column has missing values or not. Useful commands to detect missing values df. Bivariate Analysis Back to Table of Contents 0. So there are 138 patients who do not have any heart disease. We have analyzed it alone and check its interaction with other variables. Analysis of target and cp variable Explore cp variable cp stands for chest pain type. 1 In Pandas missing data is represented by two values None None is a Python singleton object that is often used for missing data in Python code. So we can see that there is no variable which has strong positive correlation with target variable. 1 The following references are used to create this kernel Think Stats Exploratory Data Analysis in Python by Allen B Downey Seaborn API reference http seaborn. 1 Analysis of target and cp variable 8. Discover patterns and relationships An important step in EDA is to discover patterns and relationships between variables in the dataset. Check with ASSERT statement Back to Table of Contents 0. Visualize the frequency distribution of cp variable Frequency distribution of target variable wrt cp Comment cp variable contains four integer values 0 1 2 and 3. isnull The above command checks whether each cell in a dataframe contains missing values or not. As it contains only 0 and 1 as values so its data type is given as int64. describe include object If we want to view the statistical properties of all the variables we should run the following command df. 1 We can see that the input folder contains one input file named heart. Visualize distribution of age variable wrt target with boxplot Interpretation The above boxplot tells two different things The mean age of the people who have heart disease is less than the mean age of the people who do not have heart disease. Each of these types of EDA are described below i. fbs fasting blood sugar should be a character variable as it contains only 0 and 1 as values 1 true 0 false. 5 Important points about dataset 6. We can plot a KDE plot as follows We can shade under the density curve and use a different color as follows Histogram A histogram represents the distribution of data by forming bins along the range of the data and then drawing bars to show the number of observations that fall in each bin. html My other kernel https www. InterpretationWe can see that there are no missing values in the dataset. There are different methods in place on how to detect missing values. Outlier detection Back to Table of Contents 0. Important points about dataset sex is a character variable. We can visualize the value counts of the cp variable wrt target as follows Interpretation We can see that the values of target variable are plotted wrt cp. First each method is either non graphical or graphical. 1 Findings of univariate analysis 7. Import dataset 5 1. sum It returns the total number of missing values in the dataframe. But it also contains 0 and 1 as values. It also contains only 0 and 1 as values so its data type is given as int64. Univariate analysis 7 Analysis of target feature variable 7. Check the number of unique values in target variableWe can see that there are 2 unique values in the target variable. It enable us to answer all of the above questions. 1 Pair Plot 9. There are 165 patients suffering from heart disease and There are 138 patients who do not have any heart disease. So there are 4 unique values in cp variable. We can use Pandas series object to get an informative axis label as follows We can plot the distribution on the vertical axis as follows Seaborn Kernel Density Estimation KDE Plot The kernel density estimate KDE plot is a useful tool for plotting the shape of a distribution. Multivariate analysis 9 Heat Map 9. Assert statement will return nothing if the value being tested is true and will throw an AssertionError if the value is false. target variable contains two integer values 1 and 0 1 Presence of heart disease 0 Absence of heart disease The above plot confirms our above findings Alternatively we can visualize the same information as follows Analysis of target and thalach variable Explore thalach variable thalach stands for maximum heart rate achieved. 1 Estimate correlation coefficients Our dataset is very small. 1 stands for presence of heart disease and 0 for absence of hear disease. So I wll check relationships between these variables. 1 We must confirm that our dataset has no missing values. target should also be a character variable. It includes analysing the data to find the distribution of data its main characteristics identifying patterns and visualizations. 1 I will import the dataset with the usual pandas read_csv function which is used to import CSV Comma Separated Value files. 1 The objective of the multivariate analysis is to discover patterns and relationships in the dataset. Outlier detection 12 1. Frequency distribution of target variable Comment 1 stands for presence of heart disease. Introduction to EDA 1 1. target and thalach variable are also mildly positively correlated correlation coefficient 0. thalach variable contains a single outlier to the left side. But it is encoded as 1 male 0 female. It also provides tools for hypothesis generation by visualizing and understanding the data through graphical representation. 6 Statistical properties of dataset 6. Visualize frequency distribution of target variable Interpretation The above plot confirms the findings that There are 165 patients suffering from heart disease and There are 138 patients who do not have any heart disease. I hope you learn and enjoy this kernel. Preview the dataset Summary of dataset Dataset description The dataset contains several columns which are as follows age age in years sex 1 male 0 female cp chest pain type trestbps resting blood pressure in mm Hg on admission to the hospital chol serum cholestoral in mg dl fbs fasting blood sugar 120 mg dl 1 true 0 false restecg resting electrocardiographic results thalach maximum heart rate achieved exang exercise induced angina 1 yes 0 no oldpeak ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest slope the slope of the peak exercise ST segment ca number of major vessels 0 3 colored by flourosopy thal 3 normal 6 fixed defect 7 reversable defect target 1 or 0 Check the data types of columns The above df. I will compute it using the df. We can follow the same principles and visualize the target values distribution wrt fbs fasting blood sugar and exang exercise induced angina. When it is close to 1 this signifies that there is a strong positive correlation. This is true in all areas of the world except Africa. We can use an assert statement to programmatically check that no missing unexpected 0 or negative values are present. We can do it as follows Interpretation of correlation coefficient The correlation coefficient ranges from 1 to 1. Here age trestbps chol thalach and oldpeak are numerical variables and target is the categorical variable. 1 The scene has been set up. References 14 1. So non graphical methods involve calculation of summary statistics while graphical methods include summarizing the data diagrammatically. Hence we need graphical methods which are more qualitative in nature and presents an overview of the data. We can write an assert statement to verify this. Now I will view its frequency distribution as follows Comment It can be seen that cp is a categorical variable and it contains 4 types of values 0 1 2 and 3. 3 Findings of bivariate analysis 8. We can plot the bars horizontally as follows We can use a different color palette as follows We can use plt. 2 Summary of dataset 6. View the unique values in target variable Comment So the unique values are 1 and 0. Extensive Analysis Visualization with Python Hello friends Heart disease or Cardiovascular disease CVD is a class of diseases that involve the heart or blood vessels. We can visualize this information below. Pandas isnull and notnull functions Pandas offers two functions to test for missing data isnull and notnull. Table of ContentsThe table of contents for this project are as follows 1. bar keyword arguments for a different look Comment I have visualize the target values distribution wrt sex. Heat Map InterpretationFrom the above correlation heat map we can conclude that target and cp variable are mildly positively correlated correlation coefficient 0. sum It returns total number of missing values in the dataframe. If we want to view the statistical properties of character variables we should run the following command df. trestbps variable contains outliers to the right side. 1 Preview the dataset 6. So I will analyze the interaction between these features and target variable. There are four types of exploratory data analysis EDA based on the above cross classification methods. The columns which has null values returns TRUE and FALSE otherwise. Same is the case with several other variables fbs exang and target. If the cell contains missing value it returns True otherwise it returns False. So we should check how each attribute correlates with the target variable. sum The above command returns total number of missing values in each column in the dataframe. Multivariate graphical EDAThere are several useful multivariate graphical EDA techniques which are used to look at the distribution of multivariate data. Dealing with missing values Back to Table of Contents 0. Asserts assert 1 1 return Nothing if the value is True assert 1 2 return AssertionError if the value is False Interpretation The above two commands do not throw any error. It enable us to direct specific testing of the hypothesis. Its data type should be object. The minimum and maximum values of age are 29 and 77 years. Analyze age and target variable Visualize frequency distribution of age variable wrt target Interpretation We can see that the people suffering from heart disease target 1 and people who are not suffering from heart disease target 0 have comparable ages. any It checks which column has null values and which has not. When it is close to 0 it means that there is no correlation. I will check number of unique values in thalach variable as follows So number of unique values in thalach variable is 91. 1 stands for presence of heart disease. The primary objective of EDA is to analyze the data for distribution outliers and anomalies in the dataset. Univariate analysis Back to Table of Contents 0. The first step in the EDA journey is to import the libraries. The next step is to import the datasets. In this kernel we have explored the heart disease dataset. Check with ASSERT statement 11 1. I will use heat map and pair plot to discover the patterns and relationships in the dataset. Import dataset Back to Table of Contents 0. The dispersion or spread of age of the people who have heart disease is greater than the dispersion or spread of age of the people who do not have heart disease. All the values are greater than or equal to zero. Alternatively we can visualize the same information as follows Comment The above plot segregate the values of target variable and plot on two different columns labelled as sex 0 sex 1. 2 Analysis of target and thalach variable 8. These are as follows Side by Side Boxplots Scatterplots Heat Maps and 3 D Surface PlotsEnough of theory now let the journey begin. 1 Several questions come to mind when we come across a new dataset. Now let the actual fun begin. 1 I will make boxplots to visualise outliers in the continuous numerical variables age trestbps chol thalach and oldpeak variables. com prashant111 comprehensive seaborn tutorial for beginners Go to Top 0. When it is clsoe to 1 it means that there is a strong negative correlation. 1 The objectives of the EDA are as follows i. There is no correlation between target and fbs. Pair Plot Comment I have defined a variable num_var. I hope you like this kernel on EDA journey. First I will check number of unique values in cp variable. target and slope variable are weakly positively correlated correlation coefficient 0. describe helps us to view the statistical properties of numerical variables. Check the underlying assumptions in the dataset. Univariate graphical EDAIn addition to finding the various sample statistics of univariate distribution discussed above we also look graphically at the distribution of the sample. So its data type is given as int64. The feature variable of interest is target variable. We can visualize the value counts of the sex variable wrt target as follows Interpretation We can see that the values of target variable are plotted wrt sex 1 male 0 female. Exploratory Data Analysis Back to Table of Contents 0. Analyze chol and thalach variable Interpretation The above plot shows that there is no correlation between chol and thalach variable. 4 Check data types of columns 6. Findings of Univariate Analysis Findings of univariate analysis are as follows Our feature variable of interest is target.
