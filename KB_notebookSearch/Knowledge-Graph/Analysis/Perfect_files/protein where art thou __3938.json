Nucleoplasm occurs most frequently in the data. Nucleoplasm is by far the most common label while Peroxisomes Endosomes Lysosomes Microtubule ends and Rods Rings are scarce Fig3. Could try with stronger closing but probably could lead to problems when actually segmenting the cells. We will look at this in a little bit more detail when investigating the actual images. This is not further suprising since they look very similiar. Let us try some segmentation methods. Different cell types can vastly differ see HumanProteinAtlas ENSG00000167552 TUBA1A in the content of tubulins which are the major constituent of microtubule e. Have to come up with appropiate sampeling strategy. Lets take a closer look look at some of the images in order to validate if this approach actually works function which fills dataframe based on target label Function that shows a given number of random imgs test opencv threshold methods. Huge differences in the label. We will try another thing. The frequency of the labels is highly variable. Combining the nuclear microtubule and ER staining gives us a comprehensive picture of the cell. Might be worth to cluster images based on the auxiliary channels prior to training. Using the complete composit image seemingly has the problem that the ER staining is leading to a very grainy thresholding of the image. It is to note that depending on the closing kernel this would allow us to acutally not only identify the nucleus but also the nucleoli. Going to try a combination of undersampling high count labels and artificial increasing amoung of samples for low count labels i. Target column shows the subcellular localization of an protein of interest POI. Afterwards we can measure the area of the nuclei and make a crude segmentation or at least image classification based on this. Also density of the cells and the overall cellshape varies. Looking at various images we saw that the amount and size of cells and therefore the POI shows a great deal of variance. In order to not over or underrespresent those labels an appropiate sampling strategy is mandatory. Those entries are labeled with an id which relates to the respective images and a Target column. These differences could possibly be problematic when using those as references in order to determine the subcellular localization of the POI. Lets further take a quick look at an overlay of the channels to appreciate nature s beauty Cell segmentation Segmentation of single cells could increase predictive power of ML algorithms since the global distribution of proteins can vary. Also cytokinetic bridge and mictrotubules microtubule ends show a positive correlation. However localization at more than two compartments becomes increasingly unlikely Fig1. Therefore we will threshold based on the nuclei this should be much easier to do. A POI can be located at more than one subcellular compartment. Looking at a couple of images shows that images were aquired using various magnifications. When comparing the single locations with the combined locations one can see that there must be a frequent co labeling of the nucleoplasm with other organelles. The relative position of the POI in it s respective cell is of much more importance. The investigation of correaltion of certain subcellular compartments shows that endosomes and lysosomes are highly correlated Fig2. It might be good to take a look at the protein of interest and if we could eliminate certain labels after a classification of images based on overlaps of POI and certain cellular compartments e. Those might be other nuclear sites like nucleoli or nuclear speckles but also others for example the most frequent co labeling occurs with cytosol. So we will start by using a combination of those three channels for the segmentation. if no overlap of POI and nucleus all the nuclear labels should be 0 in any case.
