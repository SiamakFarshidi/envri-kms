Saving face datasetsOther resources 1. The FastMTCNN algorithm https www. Taken from the original paper Face detection and alignment in unconstrained environments are challenging due to various poses illuminations and occlusions. Margin adjustmentDepending on your downstream processing and how fakes can be identified you may want to add more or less of a margin around the detected faces. This is acheived by setting keep_all True Batched detection facenet pytorch is also capable of performing face detection on batches of images typically providing considerable speed up. In this paper we propose a deep cascaded multi task framework which exploits the inherent correlation between them to boost up their performance. In the following example we use MTCNN to detect multiple faces in 1. Our method achieves superior accuracy over the state of the art techniques on the challenging FDDB and WIDER FACE benchmark for face detection and AFLW benchmark for face alignment while keeps real time performance. In order to return the detected boxes instead and optionally the facial landmarks see the MTCNN. Its use will be described below also. For single images pass a single path string e. Create face detector Load a single image and display Detect face Create face detector Detect face Visualize Create face detector Detect face Visualize Create face detector Load a single image and display Detect face Visualize Create face detector Load a video Loop through video taking a handful of frames to form a batch Load frame Add to batch Detect faces in batch Load a video Loop through video Load frame Add to batch When batch is full detect faces and reset batch list Create face detector Load a single image and display Detect face Visualize Load a video Loop through video Load frame Add to batch resizing for speed When batch is full detect faces and reset batch list Visualize Single image Batch. This notebook aims to demonstrate the different ways to use the MTCNN face detection module of facenet pytorch. jpg For batches of images pass a list of path strings one for each frame When multiple faces are detected in a single image additional faces are each saved with an incremental integer appended to the end of the save path e. Multiple faces in a single image1. Each image in the batch may have one or more faces detected. Preventing image normalizationBy default the MTCNN module of facenet pytorch applies fixed image standardization to faces before returning so they are well suited for the package s face recognition model. com timesler facenet pytorch 1. detect method on a single image. This is to enable using the module easily as the first stage of a facial recognition pipeline in which the faces are passed directly to an additional network or algorithm. The returned object will have an additional first dimension corresponding to the batch. videoname _ frame. A batch should be structured as list of PIL images of equal dimension. using the forward method for those familiar with pytorch will return torch tensors containing the detected face s rather than just the bounding boxes. 02878 the MTCNN network is able to simultaneously propose bounding boxes five point facial landmarks and detection probabilities. Multiple faces in a single imageUsing MTCNN as above will only return a single face from each frame or None if none are detected. This is controlled using the margin argument. Originally reported in Joint Face Detection and Alignment using Multi task Cascaded Convolutional Networks https arxiv. Every frame of a videoThe following example uses a similar approach to detect all faces in all frames in a video. facenet pytorch includes an efficient cuda ready implementation of MTCNN that will be demonstrated in this notebook. The following example demonstrates how to show bounding boxes and facial landmarks in every frame in a video. If you want to get out images that look more normal to the human eye this normalization can be prevented by creating the detector with post_process False. Saving face datasetsIn order to save detected faces directly to file use MTCNN s save_path argument in the forward function. Unlike the forward method shown in each of examples above the. In particular our framework adopts a cascaded structure with three stages of carefully designed deep convolutional networks that predict face and landmark location in a coarse to fine manner. The following example demonstrates the use of the. detect returns the true bounding boxes so the margin can be applied subsequently by the user if desired. A single batch of frames and1. In addition in the learning process we propose a new online hard sample mining strategy that can improve the performance automatically without manual sample selection. This is compatible with both single images and batch processing. The following topics will be covered 1. Notebook demonstrating combined use of face detection and recognition https www. To create an MTCNN detector that runs on the GPU instantiate the model with device cuda 0 or equivalent. detect method will always return all detected bounding boxes and optional landmarks in an image. Note that the margin argument if used when creating the MTCNN detector is not used in the detect method. jpg and videoname _ frame _1. The facenet pytorch github repo https github. Bounding boxes and facial landmarks1. jpg See example below. Recent studies show that deep learning approaches can achieve impressive performance on these two tasks. com timesler facial recognition model in pytorch 1. Bounding boxes and facial landmarksTo return bounding boxes and facial landmarks from MTCNN instead of calling the mtcnn object directly call mtcnn. Preventing image normalization1. For this competition it will be best to set select_largest False to ensure detected faces are ordered according to detection probability rather than size. com timesler fast mtcnn detector 45 fps at full resolution DocumentationDetailed usage information is contained in the MTCNN docstring help MTCNN Basic usageUnlike other implementations calling a facenet pytorch MTCNN object directly with an image i.
