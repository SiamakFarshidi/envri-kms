Well now it seems we can. Relationships between tables3. In order to avoid it we can introduce some limited sample size. Want to find out how to do the feature enigeering step automatically in a concise and compact tutorial applying it on a binary classification problem using lightGBM look no further After finding out that data scientists created a tool that replaces data scientists I had to try it out. Featuretools is an open source Python library for automatically creating features out of a set of related tables using a technique called deep feature synthesis. So even tough it would be better we want to focus on algortihm and automatic feature engineering NOTE Even tough it is automatic we can incorporate some manual features. Featuretools makes it easy Our goal in the end is simple. Let us split the variables one more time. Load in the data NOTE datasets are huge working on them will be computationally costly. Even more appropriately we will be working on Home Credit Default Risk. Predict whether the customer will default or not. But there is a specific way that GBM light and xBGM handle missing values. Label encoding Making it machine readable NaN imputation will be skipped in this tutorial. There are a few concepts that we will cover along the way 1. Deep feature synthesis 2. What if we can make it a one liner. NOTE This NaN handling is just for the sake of it. If we merge datasets now we can perofrm neccesary operations and seperate them later. A set of datasets where all of them are in a relationship with one another and from all of them some information should be extracted. It is by no means complete and there are lot of them underneath function is built that shows us percentage. IF we know some domain specific information. Entities and EntitySets2. Relationships betweeen the sets Feature primitives Basically which functions are we going to use to create features. Thank you https docs. com http Feature engineering is tiresome and takes the biggest amount of time do it. By going through these ideas one at a time we can build up our understanding of how featuretools which will later allow for us to get the most out of it. Feature primitives aggregations and transformations4. Train the model predict etc. Automated feature engineering like many topics in machine learning is a complex subject built upon a foundation of simpler ideas.
