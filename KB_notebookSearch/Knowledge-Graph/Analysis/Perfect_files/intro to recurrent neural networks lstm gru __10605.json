How you predict data and what kind of data you predict is up to you. Then the next time we feed an input example to the network we include the previously stored outputs as additional inputs. Ct Ct 1 ft Calculating the new memory state Ct Ct It C t Now we calculate the output Ht tanh Ct And now we get to the code. I will use GRU model for predictions. GRUs have fewer parameters and thus may train a bit faster or need less data to generalize. This is why the error is so low. Reset gate determines how to combine new input to previous memory and update gate determines how much of the previous state to keep.

Outputs from the LSTM cell are Ht current hidden state and Ct current memory state Working of gates in LSTMsFirst LSTM cell takes the previous memory state Ct 1 and does element wise multiplication with forget gate f to decide if present memory state Ct. I will use keras for this kernel. com shivamb on the mentioned topic exists. Source Wikipedia https en. RNNs have truly changed the way sequential data is forecasted. com ai journal lstm gru recurrent neural networks 81fe2bcdf1f9 Let me give you the best explanation of Recurrent Neural Networks that I found on internet https www. In such methods each of the neural network s weights receives an update proportional to the partial derivative of the error function with respect to the current weight in each iteration of training. Of course the very first time you try to compute the output of the network you ll need to fill in those extra 128 inputs with 0s or something. Components of LSTMsSo the LSTM cell contains the following components Forget Gate f a neural network with sigmoid Candidate layer C a NN with Tanh Input Gate I a NN with sigmoid Output Gate O a NN with sigmoid Hidden state H a vector Memory state C a vector Inputs to the LSTM cell at any step are Xt current input Ht 1 previous hidden state and Ct 1 previous memory state. com watch v UNmqTiOnRfg t 3sNow even though RNNs are quite powerful they suffer from Vanishing gradient problem which hinders them from using long term information like they are good for storing memory 3 4 instances of past iterations but larger number of instances don t provide good results so we don t just use regular RNNs. Intuitively they can be thought as regulators of the flow of values that goes through the connections of the LSTM hence the denotation gate. I have run the model four times and two times I got error of around 8 to 9. The cell is responsible for remembering values over arbitrary time intervals hence the word memory in LSTM. Aim and motivationThe primary reason I have chosen to create this kernel is to practice and use RNNs for various tasks and applications. Due to doubts in various comments about predictions making use of test set values I have decided to include sequence generation. We have Gated Recurrent Units GRU. com anishsingh20 the vanishing gradient problem 48ae7f501257 Long Short Term Memory LSTM Long short term memory LSTM units or blocks are a building unit for layers of a recurrent neural network RNN. Each of the three gates can be thought of as a conventional artificial neuron as in a multi layer or feedforward neural network that is they compute an activation using an activation function of a weighted sum. I will use LSTMs for predicting the price of stocks of IBM for the year 2017Truth be told. LSTMs were developed to deal with the exploding and vanishing gradient problem when training traditional RNNs. Link for that kernel here https www. com thebrownviking20 intro to keras with breast cancer data ann Your doubts and curiousity about time series can be taken care of here https www. If forget gate value is 0 then previous memory state is completely forgotten else f forget gate value is 1 then previous memory state is completely passed to the cell Remember f gate gives values between 0 and 1. Stay tuned for more stuff Importing the libraries Some functions to help out with First we get the data Checking for missing values We have chosen High attribute for prices. It s simpler than you think. It s not known which is better GRU or LSTM becuase they have comparable performances. Bidirectional LSTM is also a good way so make the model stronger. This would increase its visibility and more people will be able to learn about the awesomeness of RNNs. com Whats the difference between LSTM and GRU Why are GRU efficient to train The current version version uses a dense GRU network with 100 units as opposed to the GRU network with 50 units in previous version Sequence GenerationHere I will generate a sequence using just initial 60 values instead of using last 60 values for every new prediction. There are connections between these gates and the cell. Let s see what this iterations. The main goal of this kernel is to show how to build RNN models. com deeplearning Recurrent Neural NetworksIn a recurrent neural network we store the output activations from one or more of the layers of the network. An LSTM is well suited to classify process and predict time series given time lags of unknown size and duration between important events. We don t have the second non linearity in GRU before calculating the outpu. So don t expect a remotely accurate plot. You can try this using LSTMs also. For example if a hidden layer had 10 regular input nodes and 128 hidden nodes in the layer then it would actually have 138 total inputs assuming you are feeding the layer s outputs into itself \u00e0 la Elman rather than into another layer. What is Vanishing Gradient problem Vanishing gradient problem is a difficulty found in training artificial neural networks with gradient based learning methods and backpropagation. That s something you have to do yourself. The following has been done so forst 60 entires of test set have 60 previous values which is impossible to get unless we take the whole High attribute data for processing Preparing X_test and predicting the prices Visualizing the results for LSTM Evaluating our model The GRU architecture First GRU layer with Dropout regularisation Second GRU layer Third GRU layer Fourth GRU layer The output layer Compiling the RNN Fitting to the training set Preparing X_test and predicting the prices Visualizing the results for GRU Evaluating GRU Preparing sequence data Visualizing the sequence Evaluating the sequence. In the worst case this may completely stop the neural network from further training. org wiki Vanishing_gradient_problem Source Medium https medium. The error will be great and the best I can do is generate the trend similar to the test set. I have modified GRU model above to get the best sequence possible. The worst case had an error of around 11. Gated Recurrent UnitsIn simple words the GRU unit does not have to use a memory unit to control the flow of information like the LSTM unit. com shivamb beginners guide to text generation using lstms This is certainly not the end. Often these are hidden later activations. That s one awesome score. The problem is that in some cases the gradient will be vanishingly small effectively preventing the weight from changing its value. Applying both LSTM and GRU together gave even better results. The expression long short term refers to the fact that LSTM is a model for the short term memory which can last for a long period of time. Strong models can bring similar results like above models for sequences too but they require more than just data which has previous values. com thebrownviking20 everything you can do with a time series Don t let the explanations intimidate you. I can t give you some 100 lines of code where you put the destination of training and test set and get world class results. neither they have the output gate. First of which is time series data. But with large data the LSTMs with higher expressiveness may lead to better results. Let s see what it looks like Scaling the training set Since LSTMs store long term memory state we create a data structure with 60 timesteps and 1 output So for each element of training set we have 60 previous training set elements Reshaping X_train for efficient modelling The LSTM architecture First LSTM layer with Dropout regularisation Second LSTM layer Third LSTM layer Fourth LSTM layer The output layer Compiling the RNN Fitting to the training set Now to get the test set ready in a similar way as the training set. This has the effect of multiplying n of these small numbers to compute gradients of the front layers in an n layer network meaning that the gradient error signal decreases exponentially with n while the front layers train very slowly. Eventually I will add more applications of LSTMs. Update gate in GRU is what input gate and forget gate were in LSTM. A common LSTM unit is composed of a cell an input gate an output gate and a forget gate. A RNN composed of LSTM units is often called an LSTM network. com What is a simple explanation of a recurrent neural network Source Medium https medium.

If you are not familiar with keras or neural networks refer to this kernel tutorial of mine https www. My goal here is to create the ultimate reference for RNNs here on kaggle. As one example of the problem cause traditional activation functions such as the hyperbolic tangent function have gradients in the range 0 1 and backpropagation computes gradients by the chain rule. Source Quora https www. Just a little tweaking was required to get good sequences. You can think of the additional inputs as being concatenated to the end of the normal inputs to the previous layer. In case of stocks we need to know the sentiments of the market the movement of other stocks and a lot more. The GRU model in the previous versions is fine too. So stay tuned for more The code is inspired from Kirill Eremenko s Deep Learning Course https www. LSTM is not the only kind of unit that has taken the world of Deep Learning by a storm. But this may vary for different data sets. io generating text using an lstm network no libraries 2dff88a3968 The best LSTM explanation on internet https medium. GRUs are easier to train than LSTMs. So GRU works better than LSTM in this case. I was going to cover text generation using LSTM but already an excellent kernel by Shivam Bansal https www. The above models make use of test set so it is using last 60 true values for predicting the new value I will call it a benchmark. It can directly makes use of the all hidden states without any control.
