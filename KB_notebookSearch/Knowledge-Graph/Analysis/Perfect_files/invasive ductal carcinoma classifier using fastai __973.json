Dataset Model Predictions of the validation data ROC curve ROC area. png example 10253_idx5_x1351_y1101_class0. The original dataset consisted of 162 whole mount slide images of Breast Cancer BCa specimens scanned at 40x. Invasive Ductal Carcinoma Classifier Invasive Ductal Carcinoma IDC is the most common subtype of all breast cancers. Where u is the patient ID 10253_idx5 X is the x coordinate of where this patch was cropped from Y is the y coordinate of where this patch was cropped from and C indicates the class where 0 is non IDC and 1 is IDC. From that 277 524 patches of size 50 x 50 were extracted 198 738 IDC negative and 78 786 IDC positive. To assign an aggressiveness grade to a whole mount sample pathologists typically focus on the regions which contain the IDC. Each patch s file name is of the format u_xX_yY_classC.
