For example cyclin F is an orphan cyclin that is essential for G2 M transition. Consequently these cells may fail to correct errors leading to higher rates of chromosome mis segregation. Cyclins and cyclin dependent kinases should be understood in pair as name suggests CDK is such kinase which activates only when binds with special molecule cyclin.

E2F family members play a major role during the G1 S transition in mammalian and plant cell cycle. Cdk1 like other kinases contains a cleft in which ATP fits. This cyclin binds both Cdk1 and Cdk2 kinases which give two distinct kinase activities one appearing in S phase the other in G2 and thus regulate separate functions in cell cycle.

E2F activator levels are cyclic with maximal expression during G1 S. The unstable attachments promote the correction of errors by causing a constant detachment realignment and reattachment of microtubules from kinetochores in the cells as they try to find the correct attachment. Cyclins are proteins which heavily involved in cell cycle regulation. The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the highly conserved cyclin family whose members are characterized by a dramatic periodicity in protein abundance through the cell division cycle.
