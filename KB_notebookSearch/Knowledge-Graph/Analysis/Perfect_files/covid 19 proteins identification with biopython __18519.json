It s worth to mention that not all the amino acids sequences are proteins. com Edinburgh Genome Foundry DnaFeaturesViewer libraries. 4 The amino acid sequences were split at the stop codons. Analysis of the receptor binding motif RBM in the S protein showed that most of the amino acid residues essential for receptor binding were conserved between SARS CoV and SARS CoV 2 suggesting that the 2 CoV strains use the same host receptor for cell entry.

We have several chains of a total of 9967 amino acids separated with stop codons The split function splits the sequence at any stop codon and keeps the amino acids chains separated. The graph showing the GC is important to understand where the coding regions are in the genome. We can see that the mRNA is an identical copy with the T base replaced by U 3 Translation Translation is the process that takes the information passed from DNA as messenger RNA and turns it into a series of amino acids. org and DNA features viewer https github.

Let s dig in more and try to find out more information about those ORFs their coding regions and the functionality of their coding proteins. These stop codons UAA UAG and UGA tell the cell when a polypeptide is complete. The short amino acid sequences are oligopeptides and have other functionalities. Open Reading Frames IntroductionViral proteins are proteins generated by a virus. One codon AUG specifies the amino acid methionine and also acts as a start codon to signal the start of protein construction. As viruses hijack much of their host s cellular machinery to support their life cycle they encode very few of their own genes viral proteins are therefore generally structural components for the viral envelope and capsid 1 https www. This makes it easier for further analysis. All together this collection of codon amino acid relationships is called the genetic code because it lets cells decode an mRNA into a chain of amino acids. It involves copying a gene s DNA sequence to make an RNA molecule. COVID 19 Genetic information 2. png The first result has 100 match because it belongs to the covid 19 genome an information that we already know. So the question here is How do we extract information from this long sequence of letters This process is called gene expression Gene expression is the process by which information from a gene is used in the synthesis of a functional gene product. png PROJECT CONTENT Introduction Materials and methods 1. First observation The frequency of the nucleotides A and T is higher than the frequency of C and G. A BLAST search enables a researcher to compare a subject protein or nucleotide sequence called a query with a library or database of sequences and identify library sequences that resemble the query sequence above a certain threshold.

We will analyze those ORFs in the next section in details to find out their functionalities. Nearly every cell in a person s body has the same DNA. However in RNA a base called uracil U replaces thymine T as the complementary nucleotide to adenine that s the only difference T is replaced by U. We run a BLAST search to find out what proteins do those sequences code for. Evidence of GC ratio with that of length of the coding region of a gene has shown that the length of the coding sequence is directly proportional to higher G C content. 3 The mRNA was translated to 9967 amino acids.
