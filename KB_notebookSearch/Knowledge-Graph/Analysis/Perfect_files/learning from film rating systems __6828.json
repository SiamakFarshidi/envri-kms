We notice that the negative correlation outlined in the previous plots is indeed very week between Metacritic and Fandango when restricting the dataset to good movies only. anticorrelation between Fandango and Metacritic although a small number 0. org stable modules linear_model. Let s try it without Fandango_Stars. Input data files are available in the. Answer Fandango becomes even more biased and also highly skewed to the right median 4. csv contains every film that has a Rotten Tomatoes rating a RT User rating a Metacritic score a Metacritic User score and IMDb score and at least 30 fan reviews on Fandango. Going beyond FiveThrityEight analysis 1 Best movies only Restrict the analysis to the best movies only let us say a Rotten Tomatoes critic rating of 4 stars and beyond. Moreover Fandango became so much biased toward high ratings that Metacritic is tending to follow the opposite direction anticorrelated although very weakly. 4 Scatter plots Let us take a look into how some pairs of variables correlate visually in scatter plots. 3 Ridge regression with TensorFlow References 1. Lasso and ridge regression in TensorFlow Cookbook 3 1 http scikit learn. io 2016 07 07 TensorflowLR scikit learn and tensorflow give results that are approximately equal up to the second decimal place. Basic libraries File related Machine Learning Plotting List of films alphabetically sorted Display list of keys column names WATCH OUT for the following typo Metacritic_user_nom Rename key Set index Sort by index Reset numerical index create a feature matrix X by selecting two DataFrame columns create a response vector y by selecting a Series Split data into training and testing sets Change random_state value to obtain different final results Train model Best fit coefficients of the linear regression intercept coefficient i. Furthermore the rating systems Metacritic and IMDB seems to be more compatible than before concerning their spread. 1 https commons. com CorrelationCoefficient. io 2016 07 07 TensorflowLR 3 https github. independent coefficient Use the fitted model to make predictions for the testing set CHECK if predicition column is consistent with best fit parameters Measuring the quality of the regression Minimum of chi squared obtained in the regression Number of degrees of freedom for len feature_cols parameters p value Include extra dimension for independent coefficient Include extra column independent for independent coefficient Convert panda dataframes to numpy arrays Print again result obtained with scikit learn NOW TensorFlow Print again result obtained with TensorFlow linear regression NOW TensorFlow ridge regression axes panels j. svg 2 Fandango s Ratings Are Inflated By Rounding Conclusion Fandango is not only biased toward greater stars it overrates due to rounding. Linear and ridge regressions have converged to the same results in TensorFlow. In the scatter plots above gray colors correspond to the points from the full dataset and red colors the points for which RT ratings are greater or equal to 4 stars. Ridge regression in scikit learn 1 2. An eyeball analysis would suggest zero correlation. Machine learning Hey Most of the scatter plots in 4 look pretty linear to me. The data from Fandango was pulled on Aug. decode utf8 Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output. Pearson correlation coefficient from Wikipedia 1 2. 2 Linear regression with TensorFlow Reference Linear Regression in Tensorflow tutorial 1 1 http aqibsaeed. html ridge regression 2 http aqibsaeed. The features will be RT_user_norm RT_norm Metacritic_user_norm Metacritic_norm and the response will be IMDB_norm 1 Linear regression with scikit learn The total minimum of chi squared obtained in the regression is much lower than the number of degrees of freedom 45. The tensorflow result looks almost identical to the one obtained with scikit learn. For example running this by clicking run or pressing Shift Enter will list the files in the input directory from subprocess import check_output print check_output ls. com nfmcclure tensorflow_cookbook blob master 03_Linear_Regression 06_Implementing_Lasso_and_Ridge_Regression 06_lasso_and_ridge_regression.

This translates into a p value approximately equals 1 which is a very good fit. com features fandango movies ratings Column Definition FILM The film in question RottenTomatoes The Rotten Tomatoes Tomatometer score for the film RottenTomatoes_User The Rotten Tomatoes user score for the film Metacritic The Metacritic critic score for the film Metacritic_User The Metacritic user score for the film IMDB The IMDb user score for the film Fandango_Stars The number of stars the film had on its Fandango movie page Fandango_Ratingvalue The Fandango ratingValue for the film as pulled from the HTML of each page. svg media File Boxplot_vs_PDF. html 3 Correlation matrix for RT best movies only The correlations decreased when only considering movies for which RT rating is greater or equal to 4 stars. It would give a great linear regression solution except for the fact that the sample is pretty small. If you want to know what a box plot is check out a nice graphical representation of the concept 1. pyThe ridge regression converges much faster less iterations for the same learning rate. What does it mean For good movies according to RT the rating systems agree less. org wiki File Boxplot_vs_PDF. 2 Correlation matrix We are going to compute Pearson correlation coefficients and build a full correlation matrix. Correlation Coefficient from Wolfram MathWorld 2 1 https en. Linear Regression in Tensorflow tutorial 2 3. set_yscale log nonposx clip axes 0. Furthermore we have obtained negative correlation i. 1 https fivethirtyeight. This is the actual average score the movie obtained.
