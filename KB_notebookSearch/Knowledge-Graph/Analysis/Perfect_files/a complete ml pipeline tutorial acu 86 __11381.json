Regression Linear Regression Logistic Regression2. A uniform distribution wouldbe the extreme caseIn the case of classification problem we alwyas need to check the target distribution. RandomForest Toturial Tune RandommForest 5. I really recommend scatter plot because we can get the idea of our data without any manipulationIt seems that the data suffer from outliersLet s see for example pregnency distribution17 times pregnancy is a little bite strange is it outlier Let s investagate each fearure distribution for each out comeA fundamental task in many statistical analyses is to characterizethe location and variability of a data set. It is the automatic selection of attributes in your data such as columns in tabular data that are most relevant to the predictive modeling problem you are working on. 3f roc_auc_score y_test_sc p_sl 1. Reinforcement Learning a goal oriented learning basedon interaction with environment. boxcox data for exp dependency let s try some of them and see how our model prediction change by scallingSometime saling help to improve the prediction of tree based model so let s see 4. Supervised Machine Learning1. Kernel Kernel type could be linear poly rbf or sigmoid. Regression predicting a quantity. Thus for example if there are two highly corrolated features we have to drop the one that has more corrolation with other feature. 1 Voting EnsembleVoting is one of the simplest ways of combining the predictions from multiple machine learning algorithms. Deep Learning Algorithms Convolution Neural Network Classification vs Regression Classification predicting a label. Ensemble Algorithms eXtreme Gradient Boosting6. 2 Hour serum insulin mu U ml 6. There is not highly corrolated feature in this data set. Perform Measure. Traditional train test method suffer from high variance test problem. Triceps skin fold thickness mm 5. n_estimators Number of trees to build. A distribution or data set is symmetric if itlooks the same to the left and right of the center point. Kurtosis is a measure of whether the data are heavy tailedor light tailed relative to a normal distribution. They help you by choosing features that will give you as good or better accuracy whilst requiring less data. dog cat person and the majority areunlabeled. It works by first creating two or more standalone models from your training dataset. Data sets with low kurtosis tend to have lighttails or lack of outliers. Always good to set a seed for reproducibility 2. Attribute Information 1. Supervised Learning Input data is called training data andhas a known label or result. Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test 3. 1 Descriptive Statitics The data is not included time or object There is no null value in data set 2. ExtraTrees Toturial Tune ExtraTrees 6. Note that stratify is used becasue we want to keep the train and test distribution Spot Check Algorithms Feature Engineering 4. KNN n_neighbors Number of neighbors to use by default for k_neighbors queries 5. For example we can use several methods to resampling our data. 3f create the sub models create the ensemble model Instantiate the ensemble with 10 folds Add the base learners and the meta learner Train the ensemble Predict the test set print nSuper Learner ROC AUC score. Data Visualizationlet s take look at our data in the most raw shape. Feature Engineering methods. Error CorrolationErrors are significantly correlated which is to be expected for models that perform well since it s typically the outliers that are hard to get right. 2 imp 1 2 define two outlier detection tools to be compared Fit the problem with varying cluster separation Data generation Fit the model fit the data and tag outliers print clf_name y_pred plot the levels lines and the points decision_function is private for LOF fontsize 18 plt. 5 times the interquartile range print Outlier step step df df nameOfFeature Q1 step df nameOfFeature Q3 step Remove the outliers if any were specified Plot feature importance make importances relative to max importance boston. Then we can devide the train set to train and validation sets. A Voting Classifier can then be used to wrap your models and average the predictions of the sub models when asked to make predictions for new data. We still could improve the prediction 5. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. 1 Outliers investigation 2. Evaluate accuracy of different algorithms Improve Results Algorithms Turning methids ensemble methods Present Results Save the model Define Problem Pima Indians Diabetes Database Predict the onset of diabetes based on diagnostic measuresThis dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.

Feature SelectionFeature selection is also called variable selection or attribute selection. Algortithm Tuning 5. Decision Tree max_depth Maximum depth of the tree double. Spot Check Algorithm Test Harness. If the distribution of target is not balance we must treat our data more carefully. Ex Spam not spam or a stock price at a time. row_subsample Proportion of observations to consider double. Ensemble Methods 6. A furthercharacterization of the data includes skewness and kurtosis. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. 5 AdaBoostClassifier learning_rate Learning rate shrinks the contribution of each classifier by learning_rate. That is data sets with high kurtosis tend to have heavy tails oroutliers. Feature ImportanceBagged decision trees like Random Forest and Extra Trees can be used to estimate the importance of features.
