A thorough introduction to tokenization in Natural Language Processing. with Python code What is tokenization Tokenization is simply breaking down text into words. What s the problem No doubt the nltk tokenize API is a great way to tokenize text. Randolf emails like hello internet. What if they are not Sometimes we want tokens to be space delimited sometimes large word tokens New York and more. Commas are generally used as word boundaries but also in large numbers 540 000. And that s where the problem starts. To count punctuation as a word or not depends on the task in hand. What s the problem Why you should not use split for tokenizaiton. But it s not the case in every human language think Chinese. If using split on the text the words like Mr. com may be broken down as Mr. com samacker77 Zero to Hero in NLP to go from Zero to Hero in NLP. Understanding _Words_Take a look at this sentence The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy fox and took his meal. Hello and Hello are different in speech synthesis But I can break a sentence into words using the split method. If our training corpus contains say the words low and lowest but not lower but then the word lower appears in our test corpus our system will not know what to do with it. For some tasks like P O S tagging speech synthesis punctuations are treated as words. To understand BPE in depth and go from zero to hero in NLP follow the link below. This is not what we generally want hence special tokenization algorithms must be used. This can be done by using the Byte Pair encoding BPE algorithm to update a vocabulary with new tokens. com samacker77 Zero to Hero in NLP repository. A solution to this problem is to use a kind of tokenization in which most tokens are words but some tokens are frequent morphemes or other subwords like er so that an unseen word can be represented by combining the parts. The code using nltk vs tokenizers Note the speed of both of these methods Using nltk Using tokenizers Woah Huggingface s tokenizer is 63 faster than nltk. Leave an upvote if you like this. We can use nltk tokenize API under the assumption that the words in our text are seperated by _spaces_. A better approach Let your training data tell what is a token and what is not. But I can use nltk. Also note how these tokens are ready to feed to BERT with already added special tokens like SEP CLS To learn more on how to go from Zero To Hero in NLP check this Github https github. Randolf emails may be broken down as hello internet. But we still have a problem. Click here https github. In other words instead of defining tokens as word seperated by spaces or as characters we can use our data to automatically tell what size a token must be. Download pre trained vocabulary file. But how do you know what is a word in a language In the English language words are usually seperated by space. Periods are generally used as sentence boundaries but also in emails urls salutation.
