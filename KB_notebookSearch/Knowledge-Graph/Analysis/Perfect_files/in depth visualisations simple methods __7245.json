SibSp and Parch middle size families had higher survival rate than the people who travelled alone or big families. In fact a title Master was given to unmarried boys. The more people they are the more managment is required. Embarked C has a higher survival rate. There are only two titlted women in the train class and both have survived I would put them into Mrs class The civils and reverends a lower one due to the fact that they had wanted to help people. The age is less than 12. Alone men might want to sacrifice and help other people to survive. 2 Survival by Sex and Age Survival rate of boys is higher than of the adult men. For women the survival chances are higher between 14 and 40 age. 1 Impute valuesNB The calculation of values to impute should only be done on train set. com 2F0e 2Fe187dd2f8f1fe5be9058fa8eef419e 2F7018FE_DA_080929titanic. 7 Correlation of the variables Pclass is slightly correlated with Fare as logically 3rd class ticket would cost less than the 1st class. If you liked the Kernel please upvote Have fun with the data To get the full family size of a person added siblings and parch. However people with the title Master had mostly 3rd class. There are different techniques one can impute the values. For example you want to impute the mean of age in the mussing values in test set. The reasoning might be that alone people would want to sacrifice themselves to help others. Regarding the big families I would explain that it is hard to manage the whole family and therefore people would search for the family members insetad of getting on the boat. If there is only small amount then we can just exclude those individuals. Pclass is also slightly correlated with Survived SibSp and Parch are weakly correlated as basically they show how big the family size is. Majority from the 3rd class and most children from the 2nd class survived. jpg Visualization of titanic datasetThis notebook presents a profound exploratory analysis of the dataset in order to demonstrate different visualization techniques as well as provide understanding of the dependencies and interesting facts. Four ML techniques are used to do prediction RandomForest LogisticRegression KNeighbours and the Ensemble. Sex Survival chances of women are higher. 2 Fare and class distribution It appears that the higher the fare was in the first class the higher survival chances a person from the 1st had. Considering that there are 891 training samples 708 do not have missing values. As we have seen from describe there are too many unique values for Ticket and missing values for CabinConvert Pclass into categorical variableCreate dummy variables for categorical data. You can see that the age of of people with this title is less than 13. As there are 681 unique tickets and there is no way to extract less detailed information we exclude this variable. 2 ENGENEER VALUESIntegrate into test the title featureSeperate young and adult peopleDrop broaden variables. XGBoost I will be happy to hear remarks or comments. From crosstab we see that there were only 5 passengers in embarked Q with the 1st and 2nd class. For men of the same age the survival chances are flipped. It would be interesting to see if for instance the majority of Pclass 1 went on board in embarked C. 6 Survival rate by cabinCabin is supposed to be less distingushing also taking into consideration that most of the values are missing. 183 samples have na values. The mean of age should only be calculated on train set to avoid data leakage. Exploratory analysis Basic Information about the tableAverage Age is 29 years and ticket price is 32. However the same fact does not hold for the girls. Embarked in Q as a 3rd class gave you slighly better survival chances than embarked in S for the same class. Women and roalties had higher survival rate. Take it into consideration while engineering the variable we could specify a categorical variable as young and adult. First we check how many nas there is in general. Investigate who were masters. 3 Survival by Class Embarked and Fare. However a high variation of survival rate appears once family size exceeds 4 as mothers daughters would search longer for the members and therefore the chanes for survival decrease. 4 Survival rate regarding the family membersAssumption the less people was in your family the faster you were to get to the boat. CLASSIFICATION 1. The third class had the same survival rate as the 3rd class embarked C. 5 Survival rate by the title Barplots show that roalties had normally 1st or 2nd class tickets. UPDATE1 XGBoost was addedUPDATE2 The calculation of the values to be imputed should ONLY be done on train set and not on test set or both. 3 Class and age distribution Interesting note that Age decreases proportionally with the Pclass meaning most old passangers are from 1st class. There are 891 unique names but we could take a look on the title of each person to understand if the survival rate of people from high society was higher 1. Women and kids first c Titanic Titanic https www. We will group the roalties and assign masters to Mr and due to the fact that there were not so many roaly women we will assign then to Mrs. All women who died were from the 3rd class. Random ForestThere are many categorical features so I have chosen random forest to do the classification. It shows the number of na values in each column. Logistic Regression 3. FEATURE SELECTION AND ENGINEERING 2. 1 Superficial overview of each variableJust a quick look on variables we are dealing with. That explains large variation in survival rate and a perfect separation of men and women in Q. However if you had no family members you might wanted to help others and therefore sacrifice. We will exclude this variable embarked Q. Pclass Having a first class ticket is beneficial for the survival. I will happy to hear some remarks or suggestions and feel free to upvote if you like it Have fun with the data 1. and between 13 and 30 is lower. com dims4 USNEWS 4f3cd50 2147483647 thumbnail 970x647 quality 85 url http 3A 2F 2Fmedia. We will construct a new feature Age Class to intefere the this findig. 1 Survival by Class and Embarked As noticed already before the class 1 passangers had a higher survival rate. In fact there is a very high variation in survival rate in embarked Q among 1st and 2nd class. It is better to impute. Embarked fill embarked with a major classPclass because there is only one missing value in Fare we will fill it with a median of the corresponding PclassThere are several imputing techniques we will use the random number from the range mean std Check if we disrupted the distribution somehow. A citate from a movie Children and women first. The females traveling with up to 2 more family members had a higher chance to survive. Logistic Regression performed the best with a score of 0. Check wich columns to impute in which set.
