Even in this case I will still have some 0 mask images it also will be useful for the model Idea taking a random tile size preferred 256 X 256 or 512 X 512 aligning the tile with the image and cropping out save the cropped file to the designated location move the tile forward and repeat the process repeat the same process with the corresponding annotation file Input image file train.
