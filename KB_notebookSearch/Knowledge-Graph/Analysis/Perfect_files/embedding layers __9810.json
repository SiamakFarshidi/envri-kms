Sound mysterious In later lessons I ll show some techniques for interpreting learned embeddings such as visualizing them with the t SNE algorithm. Here s the code Training itWe ll compile our model to minimize squared error MSE. But the actual numerical values of the ids assigned to users and movies are meaningless. A single input to our model is a vector of 165 237 numbers of which we know that 165 235 will be zeros. Good idea Embedding layersIn short an embedding layer maps each element in a set of discrete things like words users or movies to a dense vector of real numbers its embedding. It s up to the model to discover whatever properties of the entities are useful for the prediction task and encode them in the embedding space. Your turn Head over to the Exercises notebook https www. The feature data for our whole dataset of 20 million rating instances will require a 2 d array of size 20 000 000 x 165 237 or about 3 trillion numbers. We ll also include absolute error MAE as a metric to report during training since it s a bit easier to interpret. But other examples abound. Implementing itI want my model to look something like this Imgur https i. In the simplest terms neural nets work by doing math on their inputs. Something to think about We know that ratings can only take on the values 0. So why is it a bad idea here Let s see what a model would look like that took one hot encoded users and movies. Looks pretty reasonable For each of the movies in the The Naked Gun series our predicted ratings for this user are around a full star above the average rating in the dataset and our out of left field picks have their predicted ratings downgraded compared to average. org api_guides python train Optimizers Passing in a string like adam or SGD will load one of keras s optimizers found under tf. We ll need to turn to the more powerful functional API using the keras. We don t have as much evidence about what this user hates. com kernels fork 1598432 to get some hands on practice working with embedding layers. Aside A key implementation detail is that embedding layers take as input the index of the entity being embedded i. But the key word here is latent AKA hidden. Our goal will be to predict the rating a given user u_i will give a particular movie m_j. we can give it our userIds and movieIds as input. com dansbecker using categorical data with one hot encoding. The column y is just a copy of the rating column with the mean subtracted this will be useful later. This is a common practice in deep learning and tends to help achieve better results in fewer epochs. Embeddings are a technique that enable deep neural nets to work with sparse categorical variables. 5 5 representing how many stars we think this user would give that movie. I claim we need an embedding layer to handle these inputs. If you have a moment to fill out a super short survey about this lesson https form. Aside You may have noticed that the MovieLens dataset https www. You can also leave public feedback in the comments below or on the Learn Forum https www. But it s not so great in cases like our movie recommendation problem where variables have tens or hundreds of thousands of possible values. The y column is just a centered version of the rating i. com colinmorris movielens preprocessing with all the preprocessing I performed on the MovieLens dataset. We ll just use the global mean rating in their case. This means that the keras. Rather than extrapolating from their few low ratings a better indication of this user s dislikes might be the kinds of movies they haven t even rated. A basic issue here is scaling and efficiency. Here s a sample Ratings range from 0. There are a few movies in the validation set not present in the training set. Bad idea 2 One hot encoded user and movie inputsIf you re not familiar with one hot encoding you may want to check out our lesson Using Categorical Data with One Hot Encoding https www. We re treating the user and the movie as separate inputs which come together only after each has gone through its own embedding layer. Save training history for later comparison User ids Movie ids NB Remember we trained on y which was a version of the rating column centered on 0. To translate our model s output values to the original 0. com learn deep learning won t work. User 26556 has given out two perfect ratings to the movies Airplane and Airplane II The Sequel. com grouplens movielens 20m dataset as an example. Why Let s review some alternatives and see why they don t work. For example this dataset of LA county restaurant inspections https www. Schindler s List has id 527 and The Usual Suspects has id 50 but that doesn t mean Schindler s List is ten times bigger than The Usual Suspects. 5 5 star rating scale we need to uncenter the values by adding the mean back The difference between rating and y will be the same for all rows so we can just use the first Add a column with the difference between our predicted rating for this user and the movie s overall average rating across all users in the dataset. Bad idea 1 Use user ids and movie ids as numerical inputsWhy not feed in user ids and movie ids as inputs then add on some dense layers and call it a day i. com meganrisdal la county restaurant inspections and violations has several sparse categorical variables including employee_id which of the health department s employees performed this inspection 250 distinct values facility_zip what zip code is the restaurant located in 3 000 distinct values owner_name who owns the restaurant 35 000 distinct values An embedding layer would be a good idea for using any of these variables as inputs to a network. Welcome to our first lesson on the topic of embeddings. y as my target variable rather than df. For comparison our best baseline predicting the average rating per movie is marked with a dotted line Compared to the baseline we were able to get our average error down by more than. Aside I m passing in df. Set random seeds for reproducibility Shuffle 2 input values user id and movie id A single output node containing the predicted rating One hidden layer with 128 units A single output node containing the predicted rating Each instance will consist of two inputs a single user id and a single movie id Concatenate the embeddings and remove the useless extra dimension Add one or more hidden layers A single output our predicted rating Technical note when using embedding layers I highly recommend using one of the optimizers found in tf. But for now we re not going to try to exploit any of that extra information. Great choices Perhaps they d also enjoy the The Naked Gun https en. io getting started functional api guide. com 82826168584267 I d greatly appreciate it. Not bad Example predictionsLet s try some example predictions as a sanity check. In that lesson we claim that one hot encoding is The Standard Approach for Categorical Data. MovieLensThe MovieLens dataset consists of ratings assigned to movies by users. org api_docs python tf keras Model class. What do they mean An object s embedding if it s any good should capture some useful latent properties of that object. Let s also throw in a couple examples of movies that this user seems unlikely to ever watch according to their rating history. You can think of it as a sort of lookup table. the rating column minus its mean over the training set. userId and movieId are both sparse categorical variables. For example if the overall average rating in the training set was 3 stars then we would translate 3 star ratings to 0 5 star ratings to 2. 1 stars or about 15. 761 Where do these come from We initialize an embedding for each user and movie using random noise then we train them as part of the process of training the overall rating prediction model. For more detail on the Functional API check out Keras s guide here https keras. Sparse Categorical VariablesBy this I mean a categorical variable with lots of possible values high cardinality with a small number of them often just 1 present in any given observation. Good luck fitting that all into memory at once Also doing training and inference on our model will be inefficient. To calculate the activations of our first hidden layer we ll need to multiply our 165k inputs through about 21 million weights but the vast vast majority of those products will just be zero. png A key thing to note is that this network is not simply a stack of layers from input to output. We ll start by picking out a specific user from the dataset at random. In this lesson I ll be using the MovieLens dataset https www. To judge whether our model is any good it d be helpful to have a baseline. In the cell below we calculate the error of a couple dumb baselines always predicting the global average rating and predicting the average rating per movie Here s a plot of our embedding model s absolute error over time. This course is still in beta so I d love to get your feedback. They seem to be much slower on problems like this because they don t efficiently handle sparse gradient updates. In this lesson I ll show how to implement a model with embedding layers using the tf. com grouplens movielens 20m dataset includes information about each movie such as its title its year of release a set of genres and user assigned tags. org api_docs python tf keras Sequential class which you may be familiar with from our course on deep learning with image data https www. This is much more efficient than taking a one hot vector and doing a huge matrix multiplication As an example if we learn embeddings of size 8 for movies the embedding for Legally Blonde index 4352 might look like 1. 5 5 so why not treat this as a multiclass classification problem with 10 classes one for each possible star rating Let s train the model. For more details feel free to check out this kernel https www. One good example is words. org wiki The_Naked_Gun series another series of spoof films starring Leslie Nielsen. They have many possible values Building a rating prediction model in KerasWe want to build a model that takes a user u_i and a movie m_j and outputs a number from 0. Import libraries and load dataframes for Movielens data. There are hundreds of thousands of them in the English language but a single tweet might only have a dozen.
