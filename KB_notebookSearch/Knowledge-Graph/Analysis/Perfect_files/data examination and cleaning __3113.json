Dividing Categorical and Numerical Data Removing and Filling Missing Values in Numerical and Categorical Data 1. For columns with less than 40 NAN Value For Numerical Data Replace NAN values with median value of that particular column For Categorical Data Replace NAN values with mode value of that particular column Converting Categorical Data to Numerical and Merging ThemIt shall be noted that numeric 0 1 2 are equivalent to died euthanized lived for outcome. 3 0 Weakly correlated Removing unwanted very less correlated featuresTo better understand how two features are correlated. com uciml horse colic 2. Data Examination and CleaningTutorial Level Beginner Data Cleaning is detection fillup or removal of incomplete inaccurate or vague data. Packed Cell Volume OutcomeThe plots show that after approx 50 outcome is most likely to be euthanized and after 60 it is likely to be died. Let us plot two most correlated to outcome features as histogram and kde plot. If correlation value is positive fetaure is positively correlated to outcome. We will be checking correlation of each column with outcome. The tutorial below discuss the examination of data and performing necessary steps to clean data including Dealing with Missing Data Removal and Filling of Missing Data for Numerical and Categorical Features Dividing Numerical and Categorical Data and Converting Categorical Data to Numeric Form Inspecting Feature Correlation to study important features Removal of less Corrlated Features Plotting histogram and kde plots to get a butter understanding of dataImporting required librariesData being used here for data examination is Horse Colic Dataset which predicts whether a horse can survive or not based on past medical conditions. UCI Machine Learning Repository http archive. Data is available via following links. 7 Hight correlated 0. edu ml datasets Horse Colic Reading data from CSV file and saving as Pandas Dataframe Shape and Nature of data Inspecting nature of data it can be seen that data consists of 17 categorical features and rest numerical out of 28. Checking missing values for each featureThe graph shows the number of Missing values in each feature most of the features have less than 40 missing values. If correlation value is 0 two columns are not correlated. Inspecting Correlation between various Features and OutcomeCorrelation shows how strongly features are related to each other. For columns with more than 40 NAN Value Remove Columns2. If correlation value is negative feature is negatively correlated to outcome. 3 Moderately correlated 0. Pulse OutcomeThe plots show that after approx 60 outcome is likely to be died which is then replaced by euthanized after 100. And after 150 the probability of died being the outcome is highest.
