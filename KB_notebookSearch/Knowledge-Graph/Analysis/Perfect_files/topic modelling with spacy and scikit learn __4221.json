What is topic modelling In machine learning and natural language processing a topic model is a type of statistical model for discovering the abstract topics that occur in a collection of documents. Larger topics are more frequent and closer the topics mor the similarity3. A document typically concerns multiple topics in different proportions thus in a document that is 10 about cats and 90 about dogs there would probably be about 9 times more dog words than cat words. A topic model captures this intuition in a mathematical framework which allows examining a set of documents and discovering based on the statistics of the words in each what the topics might be and what each document s balance of topics is. My recent kernels deal with deep learning and I want to extend that by using text data for deep learning and intend to use spaCy for processing and modelling this data. The topics produced by topic modeling techniques are clusters of similar words. Visualizing LDA results with pyLDAvis How to interpret this graph 1. spaCy also comes with a built in named entity visualizer that lets you check your model s predictions in your browser. Topic modeling is a frequently used text mining tool for discovery of hidden semantic structures in a text body. Words like ran and running are converted to run to avoid having words with similar meanings in our data. its relationship with adjacent and related words in a phrase sentence or paragraph.

Visualizing LSI SVD scatterplotWe will be visualizing our data for 2 topics to see similarity between keywords which is measured by distance with the markers using LSI model The text version of scatter plot looks messy but you can zoom it for great resultsLet s see what happens when we use a spaCy based bigram tokenizer for topic modelling LDA for bigram data Topics for bigram model Very few keywords with 2 words have been found like spin dry black cherry etc. com nirant hitchhiker s guide to nlp in spacy has made me realize that spaCy maybe as good or even better than NLTK for Natural Language Processing. A simplified form of this is commonly taught to school age children in the identification of words as nouns verbs adjectives adverbs etc. Named Entity Recognition Named Entity Recognition is an information extraction task where named entities in unstructured sentences are located and classified in some pre defined categories such as the person names organizations locations medical codes time expressions quantities monetary values percentages etc. org wiki Topic_model The index in the above list with the largest value represents the most dominant topic for the given review. LemmatizationIt is the process of grouping together the inflected forms of a word so they can be analysed as a single item identified by the word s lemma or dictionary form. Aim and Motivation Nirant https www. Selection of keywords is based on their frequency and discriminancy. com nirant s latest kernel on spaCy Hitchhiker s Guide to NLP in spaCy https www. The sentence looks much different now that it is lemmatized. Topics on the left while their respective keywords are on the right. Intuitively given that a document is about a particular topic one would expect particular words to appear in the document more or less frequently dog and bone will appear more often in documents about dogs cat and meow will appear in documents about cats and the and is will appear equally in both. You can pass in one or more Doc objects and start a web server export HTML files or view the visualization directly from a Jupyter Notebook. It involves various techniques of dimensionality reduction mostly non linear and unsupervised learning like LDA SVD autoencoders etc. ", "id": "thebrownviking20/topic-modelling-with-spacy-and-scikit-learn", "size": "4221", "language": "python", "html_url": "https://www.kaggle.com/code/thebrownviking20/topic-modelling-with-spacy-and-scikit-learn", "git_url": "https://www.kaggle.com/code/thebrownviking20/topic-modelling-with-spacy-and-scikit-learn", "script": "pcolor plotly.offline bone plot rcParams NMF English spacy.lang.en.stop_words selected_topics show TSNE iplot numpy sklearn.feature_extraction.text plotly.graph_objs spacy_tokenizer spacy.lang.en STOP_WORDS sklearn.decomposition plotly tools pylab savefig CountVectorizer matplotlib.pyplot sklearn.manifold pandas tqdm colorbar TruncatedSVD LatentDirichletAllocation init_notebook_mode spacy_bigram_tokenizer plotly.plotly plotly.figure_factory ", "entities": "(('Topic modeling', 'text body'), 'be') (('you', 'browser'), 'come') (('I', 'data'), 'deal') (('It', 'etc'), 'involve') (('spacy', 'separate nouns'), 'import') (('when we', 'cherry spin dry black etc'), 'visualize') (('they', 'lemma'), 'be') (('respective keywords', 'right'), 'topic') (('that', 'documents'), 'be') (('Selection', 'frequency'), 'base') (('balance', 'topics'), 'capture') (('Words', 'data'), 'convert') (('that', 'dog cat probably about 9 times more words'), 'be') (('Kindly you', 'this'), 'upvote') (('codes time medical expressions', 'values monetary percentages'), 'be') (('You', 'Jupyter directly Notebook'), 'pass') (('spaCy', 'Natural Language Processing'), 'make') (('Larger topics', 'more frequent similarity3'), 'be') (('org wiki index', 'given review'), 'Topic_model') (('verbs', 'adverbs'), 'teach') (('topics', 'similar words'), 'be') (('taggingThis', '1 definition'), 'be') (('more frequently dog', 'equally both'), 'expect') ", "extra": "['organization', 'test']"}
