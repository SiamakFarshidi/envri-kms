The parameters haven t been tuned yet which could open doors to more accurate models. Plot training validation accuracy values Plot training validation loss values Build the model Add l2 regularizer with 0. Even if we declare a total of 1 000 epochs the training will stop according to the patience once it finds no improvement in the accuracy. This node will get inputs from the input layer perform the learning task along with activation function. Feel free to suggest edits and shortcomings of the notebook. Metrics are used to evaluate a model common metrics are precision recall accuracy auc. org api_docs python tf keras optimizers here http keras. Early Stopping The training could be stopped at an epoch where there isn t any improvement of accuracy or loss for a specific number of rounds. Image Courtesy University of Genoa Listed below are different optimizers loss functions and metrics. Conclusion There we go We have been able to optimise this model to reduce the problem of over fitting as much as possible. Still there are a lot of things which could be done to improve the accuracy of the model since the current model only gives an accuracy of 87 on training set and 85 on the test set. 1 Configurations of a model cm 3. About KerasKeras is a high level neural networks API written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow. Build a deep neural network on this dataset. At test time no units are dropped out and instead the layer s output values are scaled down by a factor equal to the dropout rate so as to balance for the fact that more units are active than at training time. For more information you can always refer to the documentations here http www. Generate some random data Input dimension should be equal to the number of features The output should be a single outcome so one Dense layer is defined with a single unit. Its most important features are user friendliness modularity easy extensibility Table of contents1. Now it s time to work on a real data and build a more robust deep neural network. 001 as regularization value as kernel regularizer Add l2 regularizer with 0. org api_docs python tf metrics Voila We have created our first mutiple layer deep neural network which is actually learning from the data and giving you results. io losses and here http www. Dropout Dropout is another most commonly used regularization techniques for neural networks. A diagram below gives a taste of what an MLP looks like. Compile the model Train your model Plot the training history visualisation Seems the model is overfitting here. 1 Plot sample images from the dataset psi 3. Train the model by fitting the train data to the model we compiled in the above line. Conclusion conc Building a single layer perceptron A sigle layer perceptron can be thought of as a single learning unit in the network. We will build a MLP with 2 hidden dense layers and another dense layer for the output. Fashion MNIST is a dataset of Zalando s article images consisting of a training set of 60 000 examples and a test set of 10 000 examples. Dropout applied as a hidden layer randomly drops out a number of output features of the layer during training. But we will end this notebook here and leave you all to play with the parameters and improve the scores achieved above Cheers Define the number of inputs and outputs This function allows you to create a sequantial model a stack to which you can add as many dense layers as you wish. Managing Model Overfitting Now that we have trained our very first model it s time to optimise the model training dealing with the problem of overfitting. Overfitting could be handled in many ways. io callbacks The callbacks parameter of the fit function is responsible to handle the Early Stopping. Deep Neural Network on Fashion MNIST data dnn 3. 5 Plot the training history visualization pthv 4. An ideal loss plot should look similar to this. These specific number of rounds is called patience. But the work might not be visible yet. This is stored in a variable because the output of fit function is a history class which consists of 4 key value pairs for accuracy val_accuracy loss val_loss split training set into training set and validation set using train_test_split provided by scikit learn The items in the dataset are to be classified into 1 of the 10 classes. MLPs are fully connected with each node connected each node in the other layer. 4 Train the model tm 3. We will use the Fashion MNIST dataset for our purpose. The Optimizer determines the update rules of the weights. 3 probability Add a dropout layer with 0. Configurations of a model Loss functions are used to compare the network s predicted output with the real output in each pass of the backpropagations algorithmCommon loss functions are mean squared error cross entropy and so on. Plot some sample images from the dataset. keras weight regularization is added by passing weight regularizer instances to layers as keyword arguments. 1 Activation Functions af 2. Define a hidden layer with single perceptron. You can set verbose to 1 to get the status of your model training 2 to get one line per epoch here I kept it 0 to keep the notebook precise. It allows for easy and fast prototyping and supports both convolutional networks and recurrent networks. Building a single Layer Perceptron slp 1. Hurray We have come a long way. 2 Build a DNN bdnn 3. Do show your support if you like the notebook. Compile the above created model Optimises the learning by updating the weights with Stochastic Gradient Descent method. Building a multilayer perceptron. The number of units in the last layer should always be the number of classes in which we have to classify our input data. An activation function in a neural network provides non linearity to the data which is important for learning features from the input data else the learning will stop at a particular stage and leads to a dying neuron problem. 3 probability Early stopping for more refer documentation here https keras. But at least we have managed to build our first deep neural network. Call the plot_history function to plot the obtained results Evaluate the results Build the model Add a dropout layer with 0. Some most common ways we will see here include Weight Regularization Dropout Early Stopping or Callbacks Weight Regularization One of the most common way is to put constraints on the complexity of a network by forcing its weights only to take small values which makes the distribution of weight values more regular. Fit the model created above to training and validation sets. The dropout rate is the fraction of the features that are being dropped it is usually set between 0. 001 as regularization value as kernel regularizer Add a Dense layer with number of neurons equal to the number of classes with softmax as activation function Compile the model created above. This notebook is a tutorial to get beginners started with building first deep neural network using Keras and Tensorflow. Building a multilayer Perceptron mlp 2. 3 Early Stopping es 5. By now we have created our first single layer perceptron. Deep Neural Network on Fashion MNIST data. Each example is a 28 28 grayscale image associated with a label from 10 classes. Managing Model Overfitting mmo 4. This is called weight regularization and it is done by adding to the loss function of the network a cost associated with having large weights. 2 Dropout drop 4. 1 Weight Regularization wr 4. Some most commonly used activation functions are shown here. Below is an idea on how different optimizers work. 3 Compile the model ctm 3. Weight regularization could be done with 2 different techniques L1 regularization or Lasso Regression L2 regularization or Ridge Regression In tf.
