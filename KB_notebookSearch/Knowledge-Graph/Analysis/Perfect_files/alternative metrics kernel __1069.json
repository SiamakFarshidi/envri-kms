This notebook is a reworked version of William Cukierski s kernel here https www. It gives the same results. I also managed to simplify some of the formulae. I wanted to use matrix multiplication for intersection and matrix maximum for union as this is easier to get my head around that the histogram approach. Please note this is not the official scoring implementation but should work in the same manner. Hopefully this will help some of you. com wcukierski example metric implementation. This matches the table in Willam Cukierski s kernel. It will also help if I later code in C with binary maps. Specifically if two true nuclei are fused together as one in the prediction or vice versa. All comments welcomeThis is an example notebook to demonstrate how the IoU metric works for a single image. So I think this code should work ok in the general case.
