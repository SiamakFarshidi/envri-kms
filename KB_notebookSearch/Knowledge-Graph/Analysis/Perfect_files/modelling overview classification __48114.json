To see how the two AdaBoost algorithms compare we run the following codeHere we demonstrate how to see the performance behavior throughout training. When the estimated probability of a feature in a class is 0 must do some regularization. The distance measure is also highly customizable for example scaling the coordinates can make certain features more or less important. ExampleWe again use the iris dataset and try to build a classifier using a support vector classifier that predicts the species of an iris based off of only the first two features the sepal length and sepal width. These features are randomly selected from the set of remaining features. sklearn n_estimators is the number of trees generated in the ensemble learning_rate is epsilon from above discustion reg_lambda is the regularization parameter lambda min_split_loss is the regularization parameter gamma To get some more insight on how the model develops as we add more trees we display plots of the error and logloss or negative log likelihood. min_samples_split The minimum number of samples required at a node for the algorithm to considre splitting it. 2 In training each tree only use a randomly selected subset of features of size max_features when deciding on how to split a node. 1 Naive Bayes 2 Logistic Regression 3 Decision Trees 4 Random Forests 5 k Nearest Neighbors 6 Support Vector Classifiers 7 XGBoost 8 AdaBoostA special thanks to Ken Jee whose notebook Titanic Project Example https www. the logic is not merely the minimization of a loss function when combining the individual classifiers. For example when a continuous x_i takes a new value or when x_i and x_j come in a pair not present in the training data. Our goal is to add to the ensemble an m th classifier k_m with weight alpha_m so that begin align C_m mathbf x C_ m 1 mathbf x alpha_m k_m mathbf x. end align This parameterizes how badly the m 1 th instance of the classifier mis classifies the j th training sample. Sub sample size is controlled with the max_samples parameter if bootstrap True. Finally we show how to retrieve the relevant parameters of the modelLet s take a look at how the model assigns probabilities verses hours studied. com michaelgeracie modelling overview regression and clustering algorithms https www. org stable modules linear_model. Here G_b and H_b are the Taylor coefficients of the objective function introduced above. Modeling Overview Classification This is a set of personal notes on popular classification models used in data science for future reference. com questions 82323 shrinkage parameter in adaboost noredirect 1 lq 1. The kernel trickFrom the dual problem it is clear that the problem only depends on the so called Gram matrix the matrix of inner products x T_i x_j. For ease of presentation we will only use two of these features. This is nice because there is apparently a large computational cost to computing dot products and we do not have to search over more than m 2. See the documentation https scikit learn. If the gain is greater than gamma that decision node is maintained otherwise it is removed. If a map can be found that better separates the classes linearly we then carry out the linear support vector algorithm there. In computing the proper split we should give more weight to samples that C_ m 1 misclassified in the following way. In the dual problem rather than seeking to minimized a constrained lagrangian we seek to maximize the dual lagrangian which is a function of the lagrange multipliers that implement the constraints begin align q alpha sum_ j 1 m alpha_j frac 1 2 sum_ i 1 m sum_ j 1 m alpha_i alpha_j y_i y_j mathbf x T_i mathbf x_j. com questions 893 how to get correlation between two categorical variable and a categorical variab Notes Highly accurate when independence assumption is justified and if few sample probabilities near zero but independence is a big assumption. This plane is called the maximal margin hyperplane and the region bounded by parallel planes passing through the closest points is called the margin. Now suppose we are given a data point with feature vectore mathbf x. We then solve the same primal problem and retrieve the maximal margin hyperplane via begin align y sum_ j 1 m alpha_j y_j K mathbf x_j mathbf x b end align where begin align b y_j sum_ k 1 m alpha_k y_k K mathbf x_k mathbf x_j. The example taken from here https machinelearningmastery. Importantly the k_a s are interpreted as classifiers they return pm 1 not a probability that the result is a 1. m that contains the entire data set and apply the above algorithm iteratively until we run out of features every leaf is homogeneous i. It s easy to retrieve this from model. html sphx glr auto examples neighbors plot classification py. More precisely supose we have are given a binary tree. They are associated to each leaf of a tree and take the values begin align G a _b sum_j y_j p a 1 _j H a _b sum_j p a 1 _j 1 p a 1 _j. Here 0 means male and 1 femaleSince the features are continuous we need some model for P x_i C_k in order to get its value for any possible x_i. To date we have covered the following algorithms. Here we demonstrate the probability that the model associates to each sample being in a particular class. We will work through an example with continuous features and three category classification originally found here https scikit learn. This can be an integer number of samples or a float between 0 and 1 in which case it is interpreted as a fraction of samples to use from the training data. Note these are not anticipated to be statistically independent so naive Bayes may be a poor model but it works for instructional purposes. The right hand side of this expression is less likely to have the problems mentioned above since the estimates of each factor will be based off of a larger number of samples from the training data. These independent variables may be either continuous or categorical but if they are categorical they should be binary. In this algorithm our goal is to create a rule that takes a given feature vector mathbf x and outputs a probability p_ mathbf x in 0 1 that the result is a success that is y 1. Loss and regularizationThe loss function used for classification problems is begin align L y p ln p y 1 p 1 y. This is larger when mathbf x_j is misclassified y_j C_m mathbf x_j is positive and indeed is sensitive to how badly it s been misclassified. The following is the standard code to start up a notebookNow let s load some packages that we will be using throughout Naive Bayes SummaryThe principle source I used here was the Wikipedia article on naive Bayes classifiers https en. For the details on how this works we refer to the Constraints Lagrange Multipliers and Duality note those interested can message me. Though this algorithm works for an arbitrary finite classification problem we will focus on binary classification. However in many cases this will not be so easy. The main idea is that if the ensemble misclassifies a training example the next tree should put more weight on that example. The maximal margin hyperplane is then defined by some cost function which minimized by some optimal plane. We then evaluate the overall accuracy. We can minimize its score O a by selecting weights begin align w a _b frac G_b H_b lambda end align in which case the tree has a score begin align O a frac G_b 2 H_b lambda gamma t a end align To actually select a good tree we take the top down approach discussed above in the construction of decision trees. In the ovo approach a decision boundary is created from data for each pair of categories. The behavior is particularly clear when n_neighbors 1. The plane is determined by the closest n 1 training examples which are called the support vectors. We then proceed up the tree in this way. Given a feature vector mathbf x the ensemble makes a weighted vote of these classifiers begin align C_ m 1 mathbf x alpha_1 k_1 mathbf x cdots alpha_ m 1 k_ m 1 mathbf x end align and returns the sign of C_ m 1 mathbf x. m be the dependent binary categorical variable for each sample again encoded as a 0 or 1. This https medium. It looks like a good discussion can be found here https datascience. com blog 2016 03 complete guide parameter tuning xgboost with codes python. XGBoost and regular gradient boost are essentially the same algorithm but XGBoost has regularization more optimizations and built in cross validation. We could do this by calculating a weighted Gini index using the weights w m _j but apparently in the AdaBoost package it is done by sampling from the original data set at step 0 with probabilities propto w m _j and creating a new sample training set of the same size then using the unweighted Gini index. Here the superscripts indicate that everything is conditional on Y y. org wiki Naive_Bayes_classifier. Now a training point mathbf x_j of class y_j crosses the planes bounding the marginal region into iff begin align y_j mathbf w T mathbf x_j b 1 zeta_j end align for some zeta_j geq 0. The original paper with the SAMME algorithm used by sklearn can be found here https web. ExampleIn this example we take data on weather conditions and whether or not a scheduled tennis match was held that day. Note that the sklearn implementation with the SAMME algorithm replaces the 1 2 out front with a learning rate parameter l. org stable modules svm. end align Note that stumps with higher accuracy are given greater weight. We don t really have enough data to perform a good train test split of the data so just for illustrative purposes lets put in some data by hand and see how to retrieve predictions. In the first step we create a decision stump with the lowest weighted Gini index begin align frac Q_L Q G Q_L frac Q_R Q G Q_R. The dual problemFor computational purposes it is apparently convenient to switch to the dual problem. That is given a feature vector mathbf x it produces the conditional probability P y mathbf x that the dependent variable y has a given value given that the feature vector is mathbf x. We then evaluate gain or the weighted average G Q theta H Q frac Q_ text left theta Q H Q_ text left theta frac Q_ text right theta Q H Q_ text right theta of some attribute selection measure AMS H Q discussed below. Once the maximum is found the maximal margin hyperplane can be retrieved via begin align mathbf w sum_ j 1 m alpha_j y_j mathbf x_j end align and begin align b y_j mathbf w T mathbf x_j. For now consider a tree T a with a given structure of nodes and branches. This randomness greatly reduces variance in the predictions at a slight cost in bias and so is a good way to prevent overfiting. This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed It is defined by the kaggle python Docker image https github. The map phi is called a feature map and should be a non linear map. edu hastie Papers samme. It however has strong theoretical advantages which we will not discuss here. If this is not the case we need to use some non linear dividing region. The goal is to discuss the main features of a number of classification algorithms without going into too much detail and demonstrate how they are implemented in python. ExampleNow let s use XGBoost to produce such a model. The classifier then returns the category with the greatest probability. Example taken from here https towardsai. end align We add these contributions to log odds rather than the probability since this is valued in mathbb R not 0 1 so we don t have to worry about leaving a certain region. What we have just described is known as the SAMME algorith. org stable modules neighbors. The proceedureThe initial tree T 0 is just a root sending mathbf x rightarrow f 0 a constant typically set to 0 for any input feature vector. p as a function of the log odds is shown belowThis is a reasonable formula since both the left and right hand sides are unbounded in mathbb R however the linearity assumption is a big one. The dependent variable y is categorical and can lie in some set C 1 dots N. We fit a logistic regression model which allows us to obtain the probability that a student passes as a function of how long they study. Here s a demonstration on how to retrieve some predictions on sample data. A good starting point is ln left frac p 1 p right beta_0 beta_1 x_1 cdots beta_n x_n that is the log odds are linear in the features. Let begin align w m _j e y_j C_ m 1 mathbf x_j w m 1 _j e y_j alpha_ m 1 k_ m 1 mathbf x_j. It looks like the model has overfit a bit and we should stop after about 20 rounds. max_features Considers at most this number of features when creating a split. One can play around with k and well as the weighting to see how this affects the model. We then have classes C_ text perished 0 qquad C_ text survived 1 and we wish to calculate P C_k x propto P x C_k P C_k for each x in 1 2 3. In the following code cell we implement naive Bayes by hand to illustrate how it worksHence we predict that a first class passenger survives but second and third class passengers perish. This is called bootstraping. Our source for details on the k nearest neighbors algorithm can be found here https scikit learn. Even if it is very small model is highly sensitive to these small values. input directory For example running this by clicking run or pressing Shift Enter will list all files under the input directory You can write up to 20GB to the current directory kaggle working that gets preserved as output when you create a version using Save Run All You can also write temporary files to kaggle temp but they won t be saved outside of the current session we import some preprocessing methods for train test split and feature encoding as well as an accuracy checker read data and isolate only data on class and survival there are no missing values split into training and validation data now let s try to calculate the parameters of the model from the training data we first calculate the P C_k s 1 means survived 0 means perished now calculate the P x C_k s first we give the training sets conditional on the survival status and then extract conditional probabilities from it display relevant calculations training the model and predicting the alpha parameter is a smoothing parameter for the case that some features do not appear at all in the test data we set this to zero since this does not happen here the parameters of the model predicting on some sample data evaluating the accuracy data entry View the data setting up the model formatting the training data fitting the model how to retrieve properites of the model predicting on some sample data data entry setting up the model Penalty sets the regularization used when finding an MLE for the betas. end align for some support vector j. This is accomplished by mapping the feature space into some other possibly higher dimensional space phi mathbb R n rightarrow mathbb R p where the dividing region is better approximated as linear and then carrying out the above algorithm there. Furthermore the correlation is pm 1 iff X_1 and X_2 are lineraly related. To create the tree we start with a single root node Q 1. First let s get the data readyAnd now train the model and make predictionsFinally let s display the behavior of the model graphically as before XGBoost ClassificationFor more details on this algorithm see here https xgboost. com develop first xgboost model python scikit learn. Since we have a tri partite classification problem we need to specify how the planes are chosen. Let s create an XGBClassifier then and train it. m is a subset of samples present at some leaf and theta i theta_i is a given split then we create two braches one leading to Q_ text left theta and the other to Q_ text right theta where Q_ text left theta j in Q x_ ij leq theta_i Q_ text right theta j in Q x_ ij theta_i. In the simplest case categories are seperable by an n 1 plane. org stable modules ensemble. If the classes cannot be separated by a hyperplane but can be to a good approximation we still use this method but the margin will be allowed to contain some points from the training set. In choosing alpha_m the model already gives greater weight to samples that were miscalssified by C_ m 1 since each sample enters the loss function with prefactor w m _j e y_j C_ m 1 mathbf x_j. I haven t taken the time yet to figure out what happens when a point is in the positive result region for multiple or no categories. We then seek to minimize begin align C sum_ j 1 m zeta_j frac 1 2 mathbf w _2 2 nonumber text subject to y_j mathbf w T phi mathbf x_j b geq 1 zeta_j nonumber text where zeta_j geq 0 end align over mathbf w b zeta_j. Adding this to the objective function makes the model tend to prefer trees with a smaller number of leaves and weight more concentrated in a few of them. The two most common are the uniform weighting where w_a 1 k for all a and the distance weighting where w_a is proportial to the inverse of the euclidean distance of mathbf x_ j_a from mathbf x. The entropy has the same features as the Gini coefficient that made it a good measure of homogeneity or information. Hence we will want to prune the tree by removing branches. The Gini indexThe Gini index of a node Q is defined to be H Q sum_ k 0 1 p k Q 1 p k Q 1 p 0 Q 2 p 1 Q 2 where k labels the classification outcome and p k Q is the probability that an observation falling in the node Q has classification outcome k p k Q frac text of training observations at node Q that are of type k text of training observations in the node Q. We then choose that n 1 plane such that it has the greatest distance between itself and the nearest training points of any class. The stumps are selected to so that the split has the lowest Gini index. Here L is a loss function that captures how well the model matches the training data and Omega is a regularization function to prevent over fitting. The distance it impinges is given by frac zeta_j mathbf w. Some examples of these are min_samples_leaf A split will only be considered if it leaves at least min_samples_leaf in each of the left and right branches. Now we prepare the data using encoding the categorical data numerically since the decision tree classier requires numerical inputs for making splits. no pruning one sees below that the tree simply memorizes the dataset. Fortunately there is no data cleaning to do. In the presence of many possible splittings of a leaf we take the one with the greatest gain. Gaussian Naive BayesThe above example was performed without any assumptions on the form of the conditional distributions P x_i C_k. Note that all of the leaves are pure that is all the training observations belonging to a particular leaf are of the same type. m 1 with weights alpha_a. I believe the first entry in the last two lists is for none of the above. This is also a useful point of generalization for building non linear support vector classifiers that is classifiers without hyper plane boundaries. Given k the algorithm computes which k training points mathbf x_ j_a a 1. We iterate through all splitings we will not discuss the details of how these are chosen choose the splitting theta i theta_i that maximized G Q theta and create a new tree where the leaf Q is replaced by this binary node. end align Non zero alpha_j s correspond to support vectors that is vectors at or within the marginal planes. Here C is some constant controlling the relative cost of keeping the regions well separated and of having impinging points. When building a classifier to predict more than two classes one may use either a one vs one or ovo approach or a one versus rest or ovr approach. evals_result is a dictionary whose first key validation_0 or validation_1 indicates whether we are looking at the training or test set and whose second key is one of the loss functions from eval_metric. In this discussion we will focus on binary classification so that there is only one maximal margin hyperplane. Hence we seek to minimize begin align C sum_ j 1 m zeta_j frac 1 2 mathbf w 2 nonumber text subject to y_i mathbf w T mathbf x_j b geq 1 zeta_j nonumber text where zeta_j geq 0 end align over mathbf w b zeta_j. Different kernels will be good at creating classification boundaries of different shapes but we have not investigated how they perform yet. html forests of randomized trees. It s worth playing around with k and the weighting to see what this does to the probabilities for instance for k 1 the probability will always be 0 or 1. The dataset we use is some health data for females of pima indian ancestry and whether or not they have developed diabetes. We will sometimes denote feature vectors using the bold face vector notation just given and sometimes use components. AdaBoostFor a good discussion of the mathematics behind AdaBoost see here https en. Our goal is to then find some reasonable function p x_i. The parameter p will then depend on the features x_i. Below we load the dataWe create a support vector classifier and train it on the data prepared above. com analytics vidhya add power to your model with adaboost algorithm ff3951c8de0 is also a good source. org stable modules tree. where we have denoted x 1 x_1 dots x_n T and beta beta_0 beta_1 dots beta_n T. Classifier may be trained in time linear in features samples. Randomness is introduced to the model in two ways 1 Only train on a randomly selected subset of the training data with replacement. For binary categorical features i x_ ij is a 0 or a 1 for for all data points j. Even if mathbf x is in the training data the numbers of such samples may be small and we might not expect the above estimate to be a good approximation to the true population value of P y mathbf x These issues are especially likely if the number of features is large or if the features may take a large number of values. For large data sets this is a sign of overfitting and we we may want to prune the tree. These are begin align 0 leq alpha_j leq C qquad qquad sum_ j 1 m alpha_j y_j 0. end align We then have begin align P y mathbf x propto P x_1 y cdots P x_n y P mathbf y end align where we have thrown out an unimportant y independent constant. This is quite different from pruning at each step we might have a split at the root node for instance whose gain does not exceed gamma however if we never reach the root node from this bottom up proceedure the split is maintained. Linear support vector classifiersTo forumlate the optization problem let the two categories by represented by y pm 1 and let the hyperplane in question be defined by the equation mathbf w T mathbf x b 0 where mathbf w in mathbb R n is the un normalized normal vector to the plane. Let t be the number of leaves in a tree T and let w_b be the numerical outputs of each leaf with b labelling the leaves. A good regularization function will be larger for more complicated trees so that it s cost in the objective function prevents over fitting. Decision TreesA decision tree is essentially a flow chart where each node represents a binary choice based off some feature. The terminal nodes are called leaves and label which category a given input is predicted to be in. The AlgorithmLet x_ ij for i 1. read_csv for creating plots Input data files are available in the read only. The entropyThe entropy of a node Q is defined to be H Q sum_ k 0 1 p k Q log_2 p k Q. Play around with the parameters of the model. Hence if p seems likely given the observation y the loss is lower if p seems unlikely given y the loss is higher. We could alternatively keep regularization but set the regularization parameter C to be very large formatting the training data fitting the model how to retrieve properites of the model predicting on some sample data reading the example data on tennis matches break the data up into features and dependent variable perform a train test split unfortunately the dataset is pretty small so there isn t much room for validation encode the categorical variables numerically encode the catecorical data numerically building and fitting the model criterion is the attrivute selection measure discussed above without some pruning the model simply memorizes the dataset predicting whether or not we play using the decision tree since we used pruning the leaves do not have homogeneous outputs hence predict_proba tells you the probability of falling into each class once you ve followed your way through the tree display results as well as displaying them reading the titanic data since the point of this is to provide a simple example we only keep those features that don t need much engineering for same reason don t do any imputing and just drop all rows with null values to plug this into a random forest classifier which requires numeric inputs we need to do some feature encoding combine the categorical features with the numerical ones to create a single dataframe of training data recall the index is meaningful after having droped na s so we need to make them consistent before joining perform a train test split training a random forest classifier with n_estimators 500 randomly generated trees note bootstrap True by default now let s see how accurate the predictions are import the data from the sklearn prepackaged datasets package this into a dataframe with column labels to keep track of what information is what We intend to use only the first two features for our model creating a train test split import the relevant method from sklearn create and fit the model make predictions with the model and compare them to the actual result printing the results accuracy evaluation NB Much of this plotting code was lifted from a very helpful example which I found online but have since lost the link to. For a list of differences see here https www. We choose a one versus rest proceedure as discussed above this is also the default. This is the starting point for this notebook which will hopefully expand as I encounter more in the wild. See here https stats. Of course for other problems different probability distributions will be relevant. io en latest tutorials model. This cost function should induce a greater cost when the margin is small we want to separate the classes as well as possible as well as a greater cost the deeper the training set impinges on the marginal region. The default value is 1. We will return to this later to better understand the non linear kernels but for now one can play with some of the other opetions. Building treesAt the end of the day though for speed and simplicity XGBoost minimizes the Taylor approximation to the objective function. Hence the tree is constructed as if gamma were zero and then one goes back and looks at all of the lowest descision nodes. In the ovr approach a decision boundary is created comparing each category to everything that is not in that category. min_impurity_decrease The algorithm will only split a node if the impurity of the node is decreased by at least this amount. Moreover the accuracy is 0. This is the so called primal problem. io en latest python python_api. com michaelgeracie modelling overview clustering. Splits in the decision tree are chosen to minimize G Q theta. Since this is intended for my own personal use the questions and confusions I address will be unique to my own background and experience. R algoritm which may be found described in detail here https web. This example was found here https towardsdatascience. com kaggle docker python For example here s several helpful packages to load linear algebra data processing CSV file I O e. We introduce a new splitting if the gain is greater than zero begin align text Gain text Objective function before split text Objective function after split nonumber frac 1 2 left frac G_L 2 H_L lambda frac G_R 2 H_R lambda frac G_L G_R 2 H_L H_R lambda right gamma end align where L and R denote the left and right leaves that you get after the splitting. net p programming decision trees explained with a practical example fe47872d3b53 See here https scikit learn. These weak classifiers may be of any type however they are often depth 1 decision trees or stumps this is the sklearn default. Later Correlation measures for two categorical variables and for one continuous and one categorical variable. This goes beyond simple gradient boosting i. In more sophisticated applications we may want to learn the best distance measure for a model but a good starting point is to scale all variables to have mean 0 and unit variance so the model weights them approximately euqally. These are important but we will add discussion on this at a later date. Support Vector ClassifierSupport vector classifiers work by viewing the training set mathbf x_j j 1. Now suppose at the m th step we are given m 1 decision stumps k_a a 1. The iris dataset gives the sepal length sepal width petal length and petal width of 150 irises and which species of iris that flower is from. end align Here the prime denotes that we sum over mathbf x_j y_j in the training set that lie in this leaf. In particular if there are continuous features we will almost always be querying mathbf x s that do not apper in the training data. In sklearn decision trees are constructed from a data set via the CART Classification and Regression Tree algorithm which we now outline. We are then postulating p x_i C_k propto frac 1 sqrt 2 pi sigma 2_ ki e frac x_i mu_ ki 2 2 sigma 2_ ki where here mu_ ki and sigma 2_ ki are the means and Bessel corrected variance from the training data for the feature x_i conditioned on C_k. Results from the different decision trees are then averaged weighted by the probability that each tree gives for being in each class of the classification problem. Like XGBoost AdaBoost is a boosting algorithm that is it creates a sequence of so called weak classifiers this ensemble of classifiers is used to make a prediction and then each successive classifier is chosen to correct the results of the ensemble in the best possible way. Now that the data is encoded we train the model and make some predictions that we check against the test data. ExampleIn this example we demonstrate how to use the KNeighborsClassifier from sklearn on the iris dataset provided by sklearn. The primal problemThe above is a reasonable approach if the categories are approximately separated by a good hyperplace that is if the minimum of the cost function is a small number. end align Since the lagrange multipliers implement inequality rather than equality constraints there are some constraints that still come along for the ride in the dual problem. We take the log since since then the errors found in multiple trials add up that is the log likelihood of many observations is just the sum of the log likelihoods of each observation individually. Rearranging the loss function we have begin align L y_j C_m sum_ j 1 n_ text samples w m _j e y_j alpha_m k_m mathbf x_j nonumber e alpha_m sum_ j 1 n_ text samples w m _j e alpha_m e alpha_m sum_ y_j neq k_m mathbf x_j w m _j end align Let s introduce the weighted error rate of k_m begin align epsilon_m sum_ y_j neq k_m mathbf x_j w m _j big sum_j w m _j. Let s take a quick look. The training data is given by a set of m numerical features mathbf x_j in mathbb R n where j 1 dots m. html tree algorithms id3 c4 5 c5 0 and cart for a more detailed discussion of the decision tree algorithm used by sklearn. However apparently the SAMME algorithm used in sklearn s implementation of AdABoost goes beyond this emphasizing the misclassified data points in in training each individual classifier k_m by weighting the training samples with weight w m _j. We found that regularization messed with the results too much. A more detailed discussion of random forests can be found here https scikit learn. Hence computational time is spent focussing on learning patterns in the data that have not been learned yet though it seems to me this would also encourage over fitting and oversensitivity to outliers to me. ExampleAgain we train the model on the Pima indians data set. Now suppose we are given an ensemble of trees T 0 dots T k and let p k _j be it s output probability of success for each feature vector mathbf x_j. Each branch coming from a node represents the decision taken. Starting from the root we work our way downward trying to split a leaf into a node with two branches. Note that the effect of gamma is to give a bias to the gain function so that larger values of gamma tend to prune the tree and prevent over fitting. For instance suppose we are given the training data below this example is pulled from here https chrisalbon. The proceedure is to go through the data and select features i and splits in that feature theta_i such that there is maximum information gain in the split according to some measure. The idea behind the kernel is that it is an inner product in an auxiliary feature space K_ mathbf x_i mathbf x_j phi mathbf x_i T phi mathbf x_j where phi is a non linear map into a possibly higher dimensional space. The gini index is a measure of how homogeneous the node is i. To turn this into a classifier we simply take the value of y which maximizes P y mathbf x. Naive Bayes is a conditional probability model. Similarly larger values of lambda decrease the positive contributions to the gain and so discourage adding new branches. Suppose we have training data mathbf x_j y_j where y_j in 1 1 is a binary classificaton. Nonetheless I hope that others studying to enter data science will find this a convenient reference in their own data science journeys. If Q subseteq 1. The data set only includes data from three species Setosa Versicolour and Virginica encoded as 0 1 and 2 respectively. If we want to actually have a classifier we need set a threshold probability above which we predict success and below which we predict failure. Now we implement this using sklearn in the code below. To get another threshold probability we simply need to shift the y intercept. Thus we get a sequence of predictions begin align l 0 _ mathbf x 0 nonumber l 1 _ mathbf x l 0 _ mathbf x epsilon f 1 mathbf x nonumber qquad cdots nonumber l k _ mathbf x l k 1 _ mathbf x epsilon f k mathbf x epsilon sum_ a 1 k f a mathbf x end align with better and better accuracy we will discuss how to measure accuracy in a bit. We let begin align C_1 mathbf x alpha_1 k_1 mathbf x end align where k_1 is this decision stump and alpha_1 is a constant we show how to get later it doesn t matter right now as this will just be an overall scale. The image below is taken from sklearn s discussion of support vector machines which provides an excellent overview of the method and can be found here https scikit learn. We will use the following conventions throughout. end align We will discuss how to create the stump in a moment but once we have the stump the weight alpha_m will be chosen to minimize some loss function where the loss function is chosen to put greater weight on the points in the training data that were misclassified at the m 1 th step. k Nearest NeighborsFor k nearet neighbors the features may be continuous or categorical in which case the feature is encoded by integers. This is easily done using the DecisionTreeClassifier method of sklearn by feeding it arguments that give the algorithm an earlier stopping condition. end align Here Q is the collection of data points in a given node leaf L and R denote the two leaves in the stump and G is the Gini index of a single node. This is valued in 1 1 and if X_1 and X_2 are independent the correlation must be zero though the converse does not hold. The treatment of each is not exhaustive and I hope to come back later to address important aspects of these models that I m glossing over now. The i th feature of the j th training sample is then x_ ij mathbf x_j _i where i in 1 dots n. Note that we have decided to prune the tree as the dataset is quite small and a decision tree classifier can easily simply memorize the dataset. We do that here superimposed with the training data. There are many different weightings one may choose. org stable auto_examples neighbors plot_classification. In the most extreme case the tree may simply memorize the training set with one leaf per training observation x_ ij y_j. In this example we are given data on how long 20 students study for a test and whether they passed or not. The most straightforward thing we could do is to estimate this probability directly from the training data as follows begin align P y mathbf x frac text no of samples with feature vector mathbf x and dependent variable y text no of samples with feature vector mathbf x end align In practice this is rarely feasible for the following reasons We might want to make a prediction based on a novel collection of features mathbf x that isn t in the training data. k are the closest to mathbf x in mathbb R n and then makes a decision as to which class the test sample lies in by taking a weighted sum P y p mathbf x sum_ a 1 k w_a I_ p mathbf x_ j_a. Below we run the model on the validation data displaying the predicted probability that an individual survives the prediction itself and whether or not that person did. We evaluate our success with an objective function O sum_ j 1 m L y_j p k _j sum_ a 1 k Omega T a and try to choose the parameters for our new tree T k 1 so that it s contribution to O is minimized. We can solve for p p frac 1 1 e beta T x. More precisely it is the estimation of the probability from the training data. ExampleWe work through the example found here https en. When the features are continuous we typically use the euclidean metric to measure distance. This is simply the function beta_0 beta_1 x_1 cdots beta_n x_n. With categorical variables using the Hamming distance we may want to weight certain features more than other. The later is just the L function introduced above evaluated at each stage in the process. The marginal region is bounded by parallel hyperplanes mathbf w T mathbf x b 1 mathbf w T mathbf x b 1 The first equation is satisfied by support vectors mathbf x_j with y_j 1 and the second by support vectors with y_j 1. The idea behind a Naive Bayes model is to get around this by using Bayes theorem to invert the conditional probability begin align P y mathbf x frac P mathbf x y P mathbf y P x end align and then calculate the numerator using the simplifying assumption that the various features in mathbf x are independent conditional on y begin align P mathbf x y P x_1 y cdots P x_n y. Pruning With large data sets and enough features it is possible for the decision tree to overfit the data. end align The equation for b is for j such that 0 alpha_j C that is a support vector. A point is classified as 1 if C_1 geq 0 and 1 otherwise. ExampleAs a simple example let s use some data from the Titanic Kaggle competition and try to use Naive Bayes to predict whether or not a passenger has survived based entirely off of what class ticket he purchased. the data contained in each leaf is all of a single class a pruning condition has been reached to be discussed Attribute Selection Measures ASM Let s discuss the purity impurity measure H Q used to select the splitting at each node. A sample of important parameters for the model is for others see here https xgboost. We show how to encode the data numerically so that the model can be trained how to train the model and make some sample predictions. m as points in mathbb R n where n is the number of features and trying to divide regions associated with different categories with domain walls. Each tree will produces a numerical output for a given feature vector mathbf x which we denote f k mathbf x. The k nearest neighbors algorithm classifies this data point by comparing it with samples in the training data that are closest to it in some sense. Our plan is to build many trees T k. Let the objective function at step k be begin align O sum_ a 1 k O a end align with begin align O a sum_ b 1 t a left G a _b w a _b frac 1 2 H a _b lambda w a _b 2 right gamma t a end align being the contribution from the a th tree. org wiki Logistic_regression Examples. The way this is done is the so called kernel trick where the Gram matrix is replaced in the dual problem with some symmetric kernel K_ mathbf x_i mathbf x_j. it is a function of the training data that takes value 0 when a node contains observations all with a single outcome and is a maximum when the probability of being in a given category is 1 2. Now let s turn to building the trees in the enseble. We see that it exactly matches our by hand calculation. One can check the independence of two continuous variables by evaluating the correlation begin align text corr y X_i X_j frac E y X_1 mu_ X_1 X_2 mu_ X_2 sigma y _ X_1 sigma y _ X_2 end align with the training data. This can be accomplished in the loss function by putting an overall l factor in the exponential. This was easy to do since the feature data was discrete with few classes. Again we create decision nodes so as to minimize G Q theta. We find it particularly easy to see the behavior of the model in the upcoming graphic when we take k 1 a nearest neighbor model. It s also worth playing around with the relative cost parameter C introduced above. Random ForestsA random forest classifier is an ensemble classifier constructed from a large number of randomly generated decision tree classifiers. Here I_ p mathbf x_j is an indicator function telling whether or not a given point mathbf x_j from the training set has y_j p and w_a is a probability measure so that sum_ a 1 k w_a 1. 0 when applied to the test data However with min_samples_leaf 3 we get a tree with only a single decision node but an accuracy of 0. com machine_learning naive_bayes naive_bayes_classifier_from_scratch and wish to use a naive Bayes classifier to predict the gender of a person of given height weight and foot size. Instead each individual classifier being used in the boosting process is itself focussing more on the samples miss classified in the previous step. com understanding decision tree classification with scikit learn 2ddf272731bd. The above strategy constructs a binary classifier. com kenjee titanic project example has helped many lerners including myself begin their data science journeys by collecting a number of applied classification algorithms in one place. The width of the marginal region is then frac 2 mathbf w. R algorithm tends to converge to higher accuracy models quicker by using weak estimators that output a probability rather than simply a classification however we have not had time to figure out the details. A large computational savings comes from realizing we do not need to perform this map explicity we only need to know K itself. In this case it s reasonable to assume all features are gaussian distributed and select their means and variances according to the training data. As usual suppose we are given a training set mathbf x_ j with dependent variable y_j in 0 1 where j 1 dots m and the mathbf x s lie in a n dimensional feature space. A loss function that accomplishes this is the exponential loss begin align L y_j C_m sum_ j 1 n_ text samples e y_j C_m mathbf x_j end align The expression in the exponential is called the amount of say. Moreover the way in which their performance is evaluated and added to the ensemble is different. Selecting 1 when this is positive and 0 when it is negative gives a classifier with threshold probability 1 2. It s worth playing around with this parameter. In the end the model selects the class with the greatest probabilityA very efficient way to demonstrate the behavior of the model is to graph the domains that are mapped to a particular category. Logistic RegressionLogistic regression models are used to make binary categorical predictions Y in 0 1. end align This is the negative log likelyhood of the Bernoulli parameter p given a measurement of the dependent variable y. If anyone could point out the source I would really appreciate it we will represent iris species with color this requires a ListedColormap generating the domain we will plot and making predictions for every point in a mesh of that domain now let s make the plot to do so we first have to reshape Z which is just a 1d array to match the shape of xx and yy then plot the color coded mesh also plot the training points to see the behavior import the data from the sklearn prepackaged datasets package this into a dataframe with column labels to keep track of what information is what We intend to use only the first two features for our model creating a train test split make predictions with the model and compare them to the actual result printing the results accuracy evaluation we will represent iris species with color this requires a ListedColormap generating the domain we will plot and making predictions for every point in a mesh of that domain now let s make the plot to do so we first have to reshape Z which is just a 1d array to match the shape of xx and yy then plot the color coded mesh also plot the training points load the dataset and take a look loading the necessary methods separate out the features and the dependent variable split the data into training and testing sets now create the model and train it eval_set is provided for cross validation across the training and test sets eval_metric then specifies which measures of error we want to keep track of now lets make some predictions on the test set and see how they fare retrieve performance metrics plot log loss plot error load the dataset and take a look separate out the features and the dependent variable split the data into training and testing sets loading the necessary methods now create the model and train it eval_set is provided for cross validation across the training and test sets eval_metric then specifies which measures of error we want to keep track of. Note that this parameterization fixes the normalization of b and mathbf w which are left unfixed by the first equation. The basic idea is we model Y as a Bernoulli random variable with some probability p for success 1 P y p y 1 p 1 y. The features may be real valued or categorical and if the i th feature is categorical that component will be labelled by some subset C subseteq mathbb Z of the integers. Random forests are best used when there s large amounts of data and the danger of overfitting so lets use the Titanic dataset again and try to predict survival using both bootstrapping and max_features. Each tree adds it s own numerical contribution to the log odds of a positive result begin align l ln left frac p 1 p right. Note that the model finds a probability distribution function that fits the data best. Some common kernels built into sklearn are linear K_ mathbf x_i mathbf x_j mathbf x_i T mathbf x_j poly K_ mathbf x_i mathbf x_j gamma x_i T mathbf x_j r d rbf K_ mathbf x_i mathbf x_j exp left gamma x_i x_j 2_2 right sigmoid K_ mathbf x_i mathbf x_j tanh left gamma x_i x_j 2_2 r right Here gamma is always set by parameter gamma r by coef0 and d by degree. predict does this without any shift. Apparently XGBoost only accounts for gamma after the tree is made not at each step. sklearn s implementation also allows for using the SAMME. Now let s give the details. Rather we calculated these conditional probabilities using the training data. The tree ensemble will be built iteratively with each tree correcting the result for p_ mathbf x produced by all the previous trees. The number of trees generated is n_estimators. ExampleLet s demonstrate how to use RandomForestClassifier from sklearn. We begin by loading the dataNow let s prepare our data for modellingNow let s create our k nearest neighbors model. Here we demonstrate how to graphically display the decision tree using the plot_tree function. The regularization term used is begin align Omega T gamma t frac 1 2 lambda sum_ b 1 t w 2_b end align for some parameters gamma and lambda which must be specified. end align Then given a fixed tree k_m the loss function is minimized as a function of alpha_m by begin align alpha_m frac 1 2 ln left frac 1 epsilon_m epsilon_m right. For example if we use min_samples_leaf 1 i. When they are categorical a good measure is the Hamming distance which simply adds up how many features are different. html logistic regression for more details along with a discussion of regularization techniques to prevent overfitting. The kernel is specified to be linear so that we use the linear classification discussed above. As such each tree is not indidually interpretretable as it is say in a random forest. In other words the titular gradient G a _b is the sum of the residues of the training data points that lie in the b th leaf. Let s also make some sample predictions and see how the model did for illustrations sake. Questions and comments are always appreciated For those that found this notebook useful I also recommend refering to my notes on regression algorithms https www. m be a set of n numerical features for m training data points. The mode most likely result of the resulting probability distribution is then selected. We implement this proceedure using sklearn in the example below and not bother carrying the proceedure out by hand. In words this is a top down algorithm that iteratively produces a binary splitting at each node starting from the top or root node containing all data so as to maximize the amount of information gained at each node. This then gives a probability that the point x_i has y p. A choice of beta that best fits the data is given by minimizing the log likelihood of the set of observations provided in the training set.
