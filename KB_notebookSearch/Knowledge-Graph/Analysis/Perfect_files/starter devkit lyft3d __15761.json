Further there are situations where one needs to go through several tables to get a certain piece of information. We can also plot all annotations across all sample data for that sample. json train_lidar. com lyft nuscenes devkit. They are implemented in the NuScenesExplorer class with shortcuts through the NuScenes class itself. All location data is given with respect to the global coordinate system. Let s store these in a set for nowThe level5data. Note that one log can contain multiple non overlapping scenes. In addition it has several fields of the format a z _token _e. render_scene_channel renders the video for a particular channel. This points to the instance table. Sample_dataThe dataset contains data that is collected from a full sensor suite. list_categories lists all categories counts and statistics of width length height in meters and aspect ratio. If everything is set up correctly you should be able to execute the following cell successfully. We can even render a specific annotation. with LIDAR_TOP The following call can be slow and requires a lot of memory Shortcut No shortcut The rendering command below is commented out because it tends to crash in notebooks level5data. Let s get started Make sure that you have a local copy of a dataset for download instructions see https level5. The sample records have shortcuts to all sample_annotations for that record as well as sample_data key frames. Let s try something harder. zip and test_lidar. calibrated sensor Definition of a particular sensor as calibrated on a particular vehicle. sample_data Data collected from a particular sensor. 1 train my_sample_token level5data. The instance record has a field first_annotation_token which points to the first annotation in time of this instance. Let s take a look at the metadata of a sample_data taken from CAM_FRONT. list_scenes lists all scenes in the loaded DB. ShortcutsThe sample_annotation table has a category_name shortcut. List methodsThere are three list methods available. zip and test_maps. list_attributes lists all attributes and counts. get we can grab any of these in constant time. com xhlulu lyft quick eda and creating useful files by xhlulu Official Devkit for the public 2019 Lyft Level 5 AV Dataset https github. scene 25 45 seconds snippet of a car s journey. InstanceObject instance are instances that need to be detected or tracked by an AV e. zip test_lidar. sample An annotated snapshot of a scene at a particular timestamp. If you experience any issues please run these lines from the command line. org and was adjusted for the Level 5 AV dataset. Recovering this record is easy. Lyft Level 5 AV dataset and nuScenes devkit tutorial IMPORTANT This is a modification of the official devkit tutorial https github. logThe log table contains log information from which the data was extracted. com the state of 3d object detection f65a385f67a8Also you can read about resources and experiences here new quota Competition Expectations experiences https www. RenderFirst let s plot a lidar point cloud in an image. The table contains the taxonomy of different object categories and also list the subcategories delineated by a period. You may also need the train. It also gives out information about the map from where the data was collected. Let s try it This returns a list of all sample_annotation records with the instance_token one_instance token. Our dataset comprises of elemental building blocks that are the following 1. instance Enumeration of all object instance we observed. Looking at the schema you will notice that the map table has a log_token field but that the log table does not have a corresponding map_token field. Notice that it contains a variety of information such as the date and location of the log collected. csv which includes the sample annotations in the form expected for submissions. It also has a token field which is a unique record identifier. For example there is one map record for each log record. field2token method but that is slow and inconvenient. The correct dataset path contains at least the following four folders or similar images lidar maps v1. An instance record takes note of its first and last annotation token. category Taxonomy of object categories e. Lidar allows us to accurately map the surroundings in 3D. References Lyft Quick EDA and creating useful files https www. We can also render the sample_data at a particular sensor. The devkit therefore adds reverse mappings for some common situations including this one. Now let us look at the first annotated sample in this scene. These are meant both as convenience methods during development and as tutorials for building your own visualization methods. Autonomous vehicles are expected to redefine transportation and unlock a myriad of societal environmental and economic benefits. However we do not track them across different scenes. zip train_data. This is one such example. Let s look at a scene s metadata 2. NOTE These methods use OpenCV for rendering which doesn t always play nice with IPython Notebooks. Avoidable collisions single occupant commuters and vehicle emissions are choking cities while infrastructure strains under rapid urban growth. Let s take a look at an example how an attribute may change over one scene 8. Each table is a list of records and each record is a dictionary. If you want to learn more about this please check the post Some important links to get started https www. Let us look at an example. Let s examine its metadata click output A useful method is list_sample which lists all related sample_data keyframes and sample_annotation associated with a sample which we will discuss in detail in the subsequent parts. This table enumerate the object _instances_ we have encountered in each scene. Let s check the number of logs and the metadata of a log. _Using shortcut __Not using shortcut _The sample_data table has channel and sensor_modality shortcuts Data VisualizationsWe provide list and rendering methods. sensor A specific sensor type. render_sample my_sample token. render_scene renders the video for all surround view camera channels. This in turn points to a record in the category table where finally the name fields stores the required information. Since it is quite common to want to know the category name of an annotation we add a category_name field to the sample_annotation table during initialization of the NuScenes class. Let s look at the sample_annotation table. Now we can traverse all annotations of this instance using the next field. sample_annotation An annotated instance of an object within our interest. AttributeAn attribute is a property of an instance that may change throughout different parts of a scene while the category remains the same. com c 3d object detection for autonomous vehicles discussion 108609 latest 625543 Load the SDK Load the dataset Adjust the dataroot parameter below to point to your local dataset path. zip contains JSON files with multiple tables. In this section we list the short cuts and reverse indices that are added to the NuScenes class during initialization. This dataset features the raw sensor camera inputs as perceived by a fleet of multiple high end autonomous vehicles in a restricted geographic area. field2token Reverse indexing and short cutsThe dataset tables are normalized meaning that each piece of information is only given once. In this example we have 16 annotated samples for this instance across a particular scene. be displayed in the background of top down views I don t run this we need more RAM. render_scene which renders the video for all camera channels. But there are plenty of situations where you have a log and want to find the corresponding map So what to do You can always use the level5data. The sample_submission. A category record contains the name and the description of that particular category. This example dataset only has one scene but there are many more to come. For example the first record of the category table is stored at The category table is simple it holds the fields name and description. The sample_annotation table doesn t hold this information since the category is an instance level constant. Memory The map can e. Welcome to the Level 5 AV dataset nuScenes SDK tutorial This notebook is based on the original nuScenes tutorial notebook https www. ego_pose Ego vehicle poses at a particular timestamp. zip and test_data. jpeg files corresponding to samples in sample_data. Let s check the number of maps and metadata of a map. We can also render an annotation to have a closer look. ego_pose ego_pose contains information about the location encoded in translation and the orientation encoded in rotation of the ego vehicle body frame with respect to the global coordinate system. MapMap information is currently stored in a 2D rasterized image. SampleWe define sample as an annotated keyframe of a scene at a given timestamp. Sample_annotation sample_annotation refers to any bounding box defining the position of an object seen in a sample. ContinueI ll keep adding stuff here mainly EDA and Visualization. This also has a token field they all do. json which contains the primary identifiers used in the competition as well as links to key image lidar information. These are all created in the NuScenes. map Map data that is stored as binary semantic masks from a top down view. The data files test_data. Since the record is a dictionary the token can be accessed like so If you know the token for any record in the DB you can retrieve the record by doing_As you can notice we have recovered the same record _OK that was easy. CategoryA category is the object assignment of an annotation. Introduction to the dataset structureIn this part of the tutorial let us go through a top down introduction of our database. Dataset and Devkit BasicsLet s get a bit technical. Let s look at the category table we have in our database. Note that the translation and the rotation parameters are given with respect to the ego vehicle body frame. Thanks rishabhiitbhu for this comment https www. __make_reverse_index__ method. A log record corresponds to one journey of our ego vehicle along a predefined route. zip contains maps of the entire sample area. csv file contains all of the sample Ids for the test set. json train_maps. So how can we recover all sample_annotations for a particular object instance There are two ways 1. Let s render them 6. Check the official repository for more impormation. zip and test_images. field2token method is generic and can be used in any similar situation. Instead of looking at camera and lidar data separately we can also project the lidar pointcloud into camera images 3. A keyframe is a frame where the time stamps of data from all the sensors should be very close to the time stamp of the sample it points to. Finally let s assert that we recovered the same ann_records as we did using level5data. Lyft 3D Object Detection for Autonomous Vehicles Self driving technology presents a rare opportunity to improve the quality of life in many of our communities. com lyft nuscenes devkit by iglovikov DataYou will need the LIDAR image map and data files for both train and test test_images. SceneLet s take a look at the scenes that we have in the loaded database. png This dataset aims to democratize access to such data and foster innovation in higher level autonomy functions for everyone everywhere. If you look carefully at the tables you will see that the sample_annotation table points to the instance table but the instance table doesn t list all annotations that point to it. com SmartLabAI 3d object detection from lidar data with deep learning 95f6d400399a https github. A map_token field is added to the log records. get sample my_sample_token next proceed to next sample also try this e. g a particular vehicle pedestrian. You can apply your data analysis skills in this competition to advance the state of self driving technology. Instead the sample_annotation table points to a record in the instance table. Finally let us visualize all scenes on the map for a particular location. By conducting a competition we hope to encourage the research community to focus on hard problems in this space namely 3D object detection over semantic maps. csv contains all sample_tokens in the test set with empty predictions. Calibrated_sensor calibrated_sensor consists of the definition of a particular sensor lidar camera as calibrated on a particular vehicle. There is also a method level5data. com seshurajup lyft level 5 av dataset notebook from github 625566 1. Let us examine an instance metadataWe generally track an instance across different frames in a particular scene. In this competition you will build and optimize algorithms based on a large scale dataset. I modified the code for running it here and I ll add new stuff. These are foreign keys in database speak meaning they point to another table. Let s examine an example from our sample above. There are two options here 1. csv contains all sample_tokens in the train set as well as annotations in the required format for all train set objects. Here we list the provided attributes and the number of annotations associated with a particular attribute. Or if we only want to render a particular sensor we can specify that. Hence for each snapshot of a scene we provide references to a family of data that is collected from these sensors. We provide a data key to access these Notice that the keys are referring to the different sensors that form our sensor suite. Finally we can render a full scene as a video. Then adjust dataroot below to point to your local dataset path. The most important is sample_data. SensorThe Level 5 dataset consists of data collected from our full sensor suite which consists of 1 x LIDAR up to three in final dataset 7 x cameras Every sample_data has a record on which sensor the data is collected from note the channel key 9. visibility currently not used 9. For certain situation we provide some reverse indices in the tables themselves. attribute Property of an instance that can change while the category remains the same. Note that in our dataset we don t provide num_lidar_pts and set it to 1 to indicate this. Consider for example the category name of a sample_annotation. zip are in JSON format. The NuScenes class holds several tables. log Log information from which the data was extracted. com timzhang642 3D Machine Learning https towardsdatascience. Additionally we can aggregate the point clouds from multiple sweeps to get a denser point cloud. list_sample method in the previous section for more details on this. com kaggle media competitions Lyft Kaggle Kaggle 01. This way we can connect all annotations of a particular object. Reverse indicesThe devkit adds two reverse indices by default.
