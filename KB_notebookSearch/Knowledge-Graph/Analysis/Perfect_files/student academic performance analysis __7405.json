Introduction 1 Why is it important to analyze student performance 2 2. Almost all the scores are close to each other. Many factors can influence a student s performance including the influence of the parents educational background test preparation student health and so on. From the above visualization we infer that most student have scored in the range of 60 to 80 which is constituting to the overall percentage as well. Students are able to learn better when they re well nourished and eating healthy meals has been linked to higher grades better memory and alertness and faster information processing. Quick look at the dataLet s take a look at our dataAttribute Information Column Name Description gender Male Female race ethnicity Group division from A to E parental level of education Details of parental education varying from high school to master s degree lunch Type of lunch selected test preparation course Course details math score Marks secured by a student in Mathematics reading score Marks secured by a student in Reading writing score Marks secured by a student in Writing 4. Reading Score has the highest average. From the above visualization we infer The majority of students who earned an O grade were female. Healthy students are better learners.

From the above visualization we can infer that Students who have completed their test preparations have definitely scored better. We always have few exceptions. The average score in both courses reading and writing is around 70. Almost similar number of both male and female got F grade. Nutritious foods provide the body and mind with the energy needed to grow feel well be active stay healthy and learn. 89 are females while 48. Loading libraries and data 3 3. Let s try to understand the influence of the parents background test preparation etc on students performance. While a few students who did not complete their test preparations have not performed so well. It is very evident that food and nutriention play a vital role in the growth of a student both physically and academically. Introduction This data set consists of the marks secured by the students in various subjects. Ongoing assessment of student learning allows teachers to engage in continuous quality improvement of their courses. Let s create three new columns Total_Marks Percentage and grade Grading System Percentage Range Grade Qualification 95 O Outstanding 81 A Very Good 71 B Good 61 C Average 51 D Sufficient 41 E Passable 41 F Fail 6. Data Prep For a particular course the total marks is 100. We can find that in the relationship between the percentage and the mathematics score most student have scored in the range of 50 to 80. There is average success in all three course. Let s get started 2. Females whose parents hold a Bachelor s degree followed by master s degree are more successful. Majority of students received B grade followed by C. Data Visualization Out of the total number of students 51. Let s Dive Into Student Performance Stu. Visualize missing values Using this matrix you can very quickly find the pattern of missingness in the dataset. Students whose parental education level is high school and some high school have lower overall percentage. The average of group E is highest among all the groups while the average of group A is lowest. From the above visualisation we can observe that no peculiar pattern can be found There are no missing values in our dataset 5. Teachers assign collect and examine student work all the time to assess student learning and to revise and improve teaching. Loading libraries and data 3. We can see the relationship between reading and mathematical score and their gender distribution. We can conclude that most students have a good reading score except a few. Nutrition plays a key role in the healthy development of the children. Data Preparation 8 Creating new columns 9 Grading System 10 6. Notice the range 75 to 100 in the above visualization. Visualize missing values 7 5. More female students received A and B Grade relative to male students. Also there are very few who completed their test preparation but still scored low percentage. Students who had the standard lunch have performed very well. Males whose parents hold a Bachelor s degree and master s degree have similar academic performance Performance of Group E is the best among all. Quick look at the data 4 Data 5 Attribute Information 6 4. From the visualization above it is quite evident that the female students have performed exceptionally well Students whose parents hold a master s degree have a higher overall percentage. While group D and C have nearly similar performance. So let s set passmark has 35 marks. Students who had the free reduced lunch have not performed so well. Most students fall between the range of 40 to 85 marks in both the courses mathematics and writing. We can notice that there are few who have scored exceptionally good compared to others even when they did not complete their test perparation. Data Visualization 11 1. More number of boys received D and E grade.
