We use binary_cross_entropy method to calculate loss in both the adversaries. There are 2 feedback loops 1. The Discriminator is in a feedback loop with the ground truth of the images are they real or fake which we know. This has the effect of blocking the gradients to flow through the network. These images along with the fake ones will be fed in batches to the Discriminator. That is GANs can learn to create worlds spookily similar to our own in any domain images music speech. Without any further delay let s import the libraries load the dataset and get going. Instead of the function being zero leaky ReLUs allow a small negative value to pass through. These two parts are called the Generator and the Discriminator. I have only selected the bird images for training Some images produced by the generator after training for 30000 epochsThese images are far from perfect and can be improvised by more training or some hacks but I think they are pretty amazing given the fact that they are generated from nothing random noise actually. The Generator To learn a generator distribution pg over data x the generator builds a mapping function from a prior noise distribution pz z to data space as G z. GANs have a variety of applications ranging from reconstructing 3D model of objects from images to creating the 2018 painting Edmond de Belamy which sold for 432 500 Woah. They implement deep neural networks or CNN and are comprised of two parts pitting one against the other thus the adversarial. This is especially important for GANs since the only way the generator has to learn is by receiving the gradients from the discriminator. Reference https skymind. Sampling from a Gaussian Distribution instead of a Uniform distribution. This situation occurs when the neurons get stuck in a state in which ReLU units always output 0s for all inputs. Construct different mini batches for real and fake i. GoodFellow s paper is the first paper on GAN and implements a dense network both in the generator and the discriminator rather than a CNN. And for those who have probably heard the name for the first time you would be all the more amazed when you will learn about these networks. Same goes for the discriminator all the layers except the last have relu as activtaion and the last Dense layer uses Sigmoid Activation. It generally implements a Deconvolutional Network to do so. The answer is this network won t do well on multi class data you can check it yourself because of a problem called mode collapse. I am using the images without class labels from the CIFAR_10 Dataset. com up sampling with transposed convolution 9ae4f2df52d0 to produce images. So STAY TUNED It would make me very happy if you upvote this kernel and I ll be glad to hear any suggestions or feedback leave them in the comments below. For those of you who have already heard about GANs and are wondering What s the hype about should definitely go through this kernel to see the immense potential these new species of networks have. Adding some random noise to the labels before feeding them to the discriminator. Time to train the model Let s have a look at the original images. A lot of changes have been made in GAN s Architecture since Goodfeloow s original paper but some things remain the same Normalizing the input The activation function in all except the last layer of the generator must be a relu. You will have to find the ones that do. cc paper 5423 generative adversarial nets. Some of them are Image denoising Inpainting Super Resolution Structured Prediction Exploration in Reinforcement Learning Image to Image Translation In this kernel I m implementing Deep Convolutional GAN based on this paper on DCGAN https arxiv. The Generator is in a feedback loop with the Discriminator did the Discriminator label it real or fake regardless of the truth. Many activation functions will work fine with this basic GAN architecture. png For those of you who might be wondering why haven t I trained the network on all the class of images. png Let s fit this into an analogy You can think of a GAN as a game of cat and mouse between a counterfeiter Generator and a cop Discriminator. png In the generator we use a method called Upsampling https towardsdatascience. Discriminator The Discriminator on the other hand takes the role of the evaluater and tries to distinguish the fake data created by the Generator from the real one. Both of them are learning and improving. The Discriminator The discriminator is also a CNN with leaky ReLU activations. ai images wiki GANdancers. Pre training the discriminator. Leaky ReLUs represent an attempt to solve the dying ReLU problem. The activation in the last layer of the generator which is a Dense Layer is tanh activation. Using Adam Optimizer for the generator and SGD for the discriminator. That is the function computes the greatest value between the features and a small factor. The counterfeiter is constantly learning to create better fakes and the cop is constantly getting better at detecting them. This generated image is fed into the Discriminator alongside a stream of images taken from the actual dataset. It learns to map from a latent space to a particular data distribution of interest. It is usually implemented as a Convolutional Network. Generator The generator takes the role of a forger and tries to create music image speech from random noise. However leaky ReLUs are very popular because they help the gradients flow easier through the architecture. Let s take a look at the steps our GAN will follow 1. And the discriminator guides the generator to produce more realistic images by classifying it s images as fake. com Ibtastic Generative Adversarial Networks raw master GAN loss. A regular ReLU function works by truncating negative values to 0. Though in some papers like Wasserstein gan https arxiv. First things first what are they GANs are a class of Unsupervised Learning Algorithms that do much more than just recognizing image voice predicting or translating. The discriminator outputs a single scalar representing the probability that x came from training data rather than pg. The Discriminator takes in both real and fake images and returns probabilities a number between 0 and 1 with 1 representing a prediction of authenticity and 0 representing fake. Competition in this game drives both teams to improve their methods until the counterfeits are indistiguishable from the genuine or real money. The Generator takes in random numbers and returns an image. It s not necessary that all of the above tricks will work for your model. We use a Sigmoid Activation for that. G and D are both trained simultaneously we adjust parameters for G to minimize log 1 D G z and adjust parameters for D to minimize logD x as if they are following the two player min max game with value function V G D https github. pdf which is in contrast to but builds on Ian GoodFellow s paper http papers. Adding some noise to the images before feeding them to the discriminator. ai wiki generative adversarial network gan cifar 10 batches py Load CIFAR10 data Select a single class images birds Input shape upsamples to 16 16 128 upsamples to 32 32 128 outputs an image of 32 32 3 no normalization for the first layer Build and compile the discriminator Build the generator The generator takes noise as input and generates imgs For the combined model we will only train the generator The discriminator takes generated images as input and determines validity The combined model stacked generator and discriminator Trains the generator to fool the discriminator Rescale images 0 1 normalizing the input Adversarial ground truths let s add some noise Train Discriminator Select a random half of images Sample noise and generate a batch of new images Train the discriminator real classified as ones and generated as zeros Train Generator Train the generator wants discriminator to mistake images as real Plot the progress. I have used Upsampling2D but TransposeConv2d stride or PixelShuffle could be used alternatively. each mini batch needs to contain only all real images or all generated images. GANs have incredible potential because they can learn to imitate any distribution of data. Finally the discriminator needs to output probabilities. The counterfeiter is learning to create fake money and the cop is learning to detect the fake money. With that said what follows is a loop in which The generator tries to maximize the probability of fooling the Discriminator by making the images for example more close to real in each step thereby making the Discriminator classify them as real. For these cases the gradients are completely shut to flow back through the network. pdf different loss functions is used Now some hacks tips that have been introduced in papers in the last few years to make GANs better are Using BatchNormalization in all layers except the input layer in the generator and the output layer in the discriminator.
