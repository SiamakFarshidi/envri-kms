Since k means clustering is sensitive to scale it can be a good idea rescale or normalize data with extreme values. Our model can then just learn the simpler chunks one by one instead having to learn the complicated whole all at once. Clustering simply means the assigning of data points to groups based upon how similar the points are to each other. Create cluster feature. Left Clustering a single feature. The motivating idea for adding cluster labels is that the clusters will break up complicated relationships across features into simpler chunks. On smaller chunks however the relationship is almost linear and that the model can learn easily. The animation below shows the algorithm in action. assign points to the nearest cluster centroid2. The K means clustering algorithm on Airbnb rentals in NYC. com camnugent california housing prices s Latitude and Longitude make natural candidates for k means clustering. It creates clusters by placing a number of points called centroids inside the feature space. org stable auto_examples preprocessing plot_discretization_classification. In this example we ll cluster these with MedInc median income to create economic segments in different regions of California. The algorithm starts by randomly initializing some predefined number n_clusters of centroids. Depending on your application another algorithm might be more appropriate. Introduction This lesson and the next make use of what are known as unsupervised learning algorithms. Each point in the dataset is assigned to the cluster of whichever centroid it s closest to. When used for feature engineering we could attempt to discover groups of customers representing a market segment for instance or geographic areas that share similar weather patterns. When sets of circles from competing centroids overlap they form a line. The result is what s called a Voronoi tessallation. On multiple features it s like multi dimensional binning sometimes called vector quantization. The best partitioning for a set of features depends on the model you re using and what you re trying to predict so it s best to tune it like any hyperparameter through cross validation say. It often happens that the initial random position of the centroids ends in a poor clustering. Unsupervised algorithms don t make use of a target instead their purpose is to learn some property of the data to represent the structure of the features in a certain way. The curved relationship between the YearBuilt and SalePrice is too complicated for this kind of model it underfits. Let s review how the k means algorithm learns the clusters and what that means for feature engineering. It then iterates over these two operations 1. Adding a feature of cluster labels can help machine learning models untangle complicated relationships of space or proximity. The target in this dataset is MedHouseVal median house value. move each centroid to minimize the distance to its pointsIt iterates over these two steps until the centroids aren t moving anymore or until some maximum number of iterations has passed max_iter. In the context of feature engineering for prediction you could think of an unsupervised algorithm as a feature discovery technique. For this reason the algorithm repeats a number of times n_init and returns the clustering that has the least total distance between each point and its centroid the optimal clustering. It s a simple two step process. Example California Housing As spatial features California Housing https www. 988 0 It s important to remember that this Cluster feature is categorical. Clustering the YearBuilt feature helps this linear model learn its relationship to SalePrice. The algorithm we ll use k means is intuitive and easy to apply in a feature engineering context. Our features are already roughly on the same scale so we ll leave them as is. com c house prices advanced regression techniques data dataset above is a k means clustering. You could imagine each centroid capturing points through a sequence of radiating circles. If the clustering is informative these distributions should for the most part separate across MedHouseVal which is indeed what we see. A clustering algorithm makes birds of a feather flock together so to speak. Right Clustering across two features. Here it s shown with a label encoding that is as a sequence of integers as a typical clustering algorithm would produce depending on your model a one hot encoding may be more appropriate. K means clustering measures similarity using ordinary straight line distance Euclidean distance in other words. The k in k means is how many centroids that is clusters it creates. Your Turn Add a feature of cluster labels https www. k Means Clustering There are a great many clustering algorithms. We ll focus on three parameters from scikit learn s implementation n_clusters max_iter and n_init. The tessallation shows you to what clusters future data will be assigned the tessallation is essentially what k means learns from its training data. They differ primarily in how they measure similarity or proximity and in what kinds of features they work with. Added to a dataframe a feature of cluster labels might look like this Longitude Latitude Cluster 93. K means clustering creates a Voronoi tessallation of the feature space. It seems like the algorithm has created separate segments for higher income areas on the coasts. Cluster Labels as a Feature Applied to a single real valued feature clustering acts like a traditional binning or discretization https scikit learn. It s a divide and conquer strategy. You define the k yourself. These box plots show the distribution of the target within each cluster. It illustrates the dependence of the result on the initial centroids and the importance of iterating until convergence. Ordinarily though the only parameter you ll need to choose yourself is n_clusters k that is. Now let s look at a couple plots to see how effective this was. First a scatter plot that shows the geographic distribution of the clusters. You may need to increase the max_iter for a large number of clusters or n_init for a complex dataset. 060 1 93. The figure shows how clustering can improve a simple linear model. 053 3 93. The clustering on the Ames https www. Here is the same figure with the tessallation and centroids shown.
