I display here my results for the Buro data set taking under consideration only the first 50 000 rows and performing only a mean aggregate on the data. Elsewise these times are forbidding of using the tool on the entire data set. I thought I d give it a try to see if it brings in any interesting new features to this competition. I recently came across this package called Featuretools for performing Feature Engineering in an automated way. It seems that you can manually set the chunk size that the method reads somewhat like batch in Neural Networks I guess to improve running times. I was able to only partially improve time taken to complete the process and yet miles away than the respective pandas transformations. However after waiting for so long for the process to complete on a single table I searched it a little further. I have counted elapsed time for a variety of chunk sizes and plotted their times.
