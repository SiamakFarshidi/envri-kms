The reconstructed data is close to the original data with minimum reconstruction loss as possible. Unlike other compression algorithms such as JPEG can compress any image input this is not true for autoencoders. Layers of autoencoders can easily learn to ignore the noise in the encoded images bottleneck and hence can regenerate the denoised image. That all for now You can build your autoencoders. Visualise Training dataLet s see how our training data looks like Input Noisy Images Original Images Autoencoder ModelI am using basic CNN architecture to build the model CNN works well with images. CNN can improve the reconstruction quality. There are other uses as well such as using autoencoder for sequential data.
