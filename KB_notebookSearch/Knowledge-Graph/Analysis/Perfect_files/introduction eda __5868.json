We are provided with a labelled training set of 10 616 Whole Slide Images of prostate tissue biopsies. For example a biopsy that contains 60 Gleason 4 37 Gleason 3 and 3 Gleason 5 should get a score of 4 5 9. The Gleason Score directly leads to the ISUP grade as per figure 1. Let us now check to ensure that Gleason patterns are mapped to ISUP grades as per figure 1. Screen 20Shot 202020 04 08 20at 202. Let us now compare the relative distribution of ISUP grade by data provider. References Str\u00f6m Kartasalo 2020 Rohit Singh s Notebook https www. These tissue samples are examined by a pathologist and scored according to the Gleason grading system. Deep Learning systems have shown promise in accurately grading PCa. The quadratic weighted kappa is used to score submissions. A training example from karolinska with Gleason score 4 3 but ISUP grade of 2. For details see Epstein 2016. Let us now dig into the data further to check distribution of ISUP grades and Gleason Patterns both generally and comparing across providers. The code below confirms this. This chart confirms what we checked earlier with regards the differing labels of benign examples across our two data providers. While the opposite is true for Gleason score 4 3. A score of 1 represents a perfect submission with no errors on the test set while 0 represents a performance no better than chance. if pattern 3 is less than 5 the Gleason score 4 3 will instead be 4 4. The weighted kappa penalises incorrect predictions more the further they lie from the correct ISUP value. png attachment Screen 20Shot 202020 04 08 20at 202. We will also check that Gleason Patterns and ISUP Grades match for each training example. We shall find now find the image id for this suspicious case and also ensure there are no other suspicious cases. Biopsies recieve their Gleason grade according to the architectural growth patterns of the tumor Fig. We see in the above chart that there are comparatively few training examples for some of the most severe Gleason Patterns. This may serve as a useful sanity check on model predictions. These systems were not until this challenge tested with multi center datasets at scale. More of our severe cases scores with 5 as minority or majority pattern come from radboud rather than karolinska. We see that 1 training example with Gleason Pattern 4 3 is mapped to an unexpected ISUP grade. The only category involving Gleason pattern 5 which is present in the traning data at a rate of more than 2. We see karaolinska provides more of the training examples with ISUP grade 0 or 1 while radboud provides more of the training examples with ISUP grade 3 4 or 5. To simplify slightly in the case of multiple different Gleason patterns being present the score is composed of the most frequently occurring pattern and the second most frequent pattern in the biopsy as judged by the pathologist. 1 the patterns present in a single biopsy are used to form a Gleason score e. We see here that within the test data we are provided with image id and data_provider. Radboud labels benign examples as negative label while karolinska uses 0 0. We also see that benign slides have two different lables 0 0 or negative presumably this is due to variation in labelling by data provider. We have the same two unique data providers. We see that over 25 of our data is benign ISUP grade 0 while another 25 is ISUP grade 1 the other 4 ISUP grades are present in our data at a rate in the range 11. 10616 image ids images can be loaded from this unique id and the corresponding data provider karoliska or radboud ISUP grade and Gleason Score which directly leads to the ISUP grade as per Figure 1. The system suffers from significant inter observer variability while in some countries there is a lack of qaulified pathologists. The training set for this challenge is the most extensive multi center dataset on Gleason grading available. Submissions will be scored based on their performance in predicting an ISUP grade for a hidden test set graded by expert pathologists. We also see our training data has shape 10616 x 3. com rohitsingh9990 panda eda better visualization simple baselineProstate Cancer PCa Grade assessment. This information may come in useful at future junctures in the design of this ML system. As mentioned in the challenge overview this is a truncated version of the test file full versions are available to notebooks upon submission. Ok so that is the end of our exploratory data analysis we have isolated a mis labelled example discovered two differing labels for benign cases and gained an understanding about how our examples break down by data provider. The minority pattern must account for at least 5 of the total area to be included e. Let us now check how the distibrution of Gleason score s vary by provider. We will probably remove this example unless there is a very obvious mis labelling we can correct. Generally the cases from karolinska are skewed towards the less severe end of the scale compared to radboud. png Exploratory Data Analysis Rohit Singh s Notebook listed in references was helpful for several aspects of this. We see above the first 5 rows and header row of our data. There is just one suspicious case which we saw on the plot. We also see more than twice as many 3 3 scores from karoliska than radboud. We see that our training data is close enough to being evenly split between our two data providers. There is a risk of missing cancers and a risk of overgrading resulting in unnecessary treatment. Let us compute the likelihood that the Gleason Score is 4 5 given that 5 is one of the scores.
