We can see that the highest accurracy is 98. read_csv Input data files are available in the. Using K Nearest Neighbors Naive Bayes Decision Tree Random Forest XgBoost Support Vector Machine Neural Network to build models K Nearest NeighborsUsing neighbors. We will build models by using the 20 features and the 3 distinct features. XgBoost is a powerful algorithm and very popular in Data Science competition. RandomForestClassifier to build the model. KNeighborsClassifier to build the model. Next time I will try to oppotimize the parameters of XgBoost. 74 which is made by XgBoost.
