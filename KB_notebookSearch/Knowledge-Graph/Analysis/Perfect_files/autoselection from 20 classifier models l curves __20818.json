Such a classifier can be useful for a set of equally well performing model in order to balance out their individual weaknesses. models that are only slightly better than random guessing such as small decision trees on repeatedly modified versions of the data. Initially those weights are all set to 1 N so that the first step simply trains a weak learner on the original data. 83253 Comparison 20 popular models https www. max_depth min_samples_leaf etc. For each successive iteration the sample weights are individually modified and the learning algorithm is reapplied to the reweighted data. com startupsci titanic data science solutionsIn pattern recognition the k Nearest Neighbors algorithm or k NN for short is a non parametric method used for classification and regression.
