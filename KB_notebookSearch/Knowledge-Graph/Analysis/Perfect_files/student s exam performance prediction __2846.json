Above graphs shows that score 40 can be deciding score to state student is pass or fail. Dataset do not have any null values. Which major factors contribute to test outcomes Lunch test preparation course and parents education are major factors. All features are categorical. Which major factors contribute to test outcomes 3. Test preparation course helps a lot to student to pass the examination. Parent s education level also plays major role in students result. Train Test split Model Selection Above plot shows that model is predicting quite good for value between range of 50 80 as majority of data lies in that range but it is performing worst for other values. There s no outliers in score as all values are in the range of 0 100. Also if possible parent should also educate themself so that they can help the student with thier studies whenever they require. Grades are require to measure students performance in exam. Handling categorical variable1. Now grade can be allocated as follow A above 90B 80 89C 70 79D 55 69E 40 54F below 40 score in any subject Data analysisFrom above graphs we can conclude the followings 1. What would be the best way to improve student scores on each test If student get standard lunch and completed test preparation course will help student to score better in exam. Parent education is ordinal category so it ll replace with proper order. Studeds having standard lunch and conpleted test preparation course gets good grade in examination. How effective is the test preparation course 2. Above graphs concludes following 1. From above we can conclude that linear regression and support vector MSE is less but it not good model as it ll always predict the value in range of 50 80 therefoere Randonforest can be consider as best model for this dataset. gender lunch and test preparation course are binay columns so simply converted in 0 and 1 values. What would be the best way to improve student scores on each test Importing require libraries Importing dataset Checking duplicate valuesDataset do not have any duplicate values Checking data info Observations 1. Also if parents have degree or master level education then studens perfoms well in examination. Group is nominal variable so appling one hot encoding. Percdentage needs to calculate to allocate grade. Analysis result How effective is the test preparation course It plays major role in result and helps to score better grade.
