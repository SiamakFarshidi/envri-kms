For more on submission. com artifacts number of classes. Dataset related hyperparametersI created three variants of the dataset by changing the hyperparameters by simply running the jupyter cells you can create a new dataset and save as artifacts. The three transforms that this notebook uses are STFT based spectrogram Log of the spectrogram MFCC based spectrogram_Sneak Peak of the dataset_ img https i. com c rfcx species audio detection discussion 200757. Take three such transforms and stack them together to form 3 channel image. csv check out this discussion thread https www. Imports and Setups Simple EDALet s briefly investigate csv files. Mel Frequency Ceptral Coefficients MFCCs IDEA Stack all three transformations such that we get a standard 3 channel image. One of the most used method for audio based classification is to convert 1D audio signal to 2D image representation and use well established computer vision techniques. Idea Transform the audio data to get one channel image data like spectrogram. STFT based spectrogram 2. png In a different kernel we shall consume these artifacts to train neural network based models. Let us see the number of training audio files. STFT based log spectrogramSImply convert the spectrogram to log scale. We will save the dataset as W B artifacts. You can later use the same to download the dataset and train a model. A peek into the file. General description Number of ClassesPointers There are 24 species of birds and frogs together. There are 1216 rows in train_tp. make a directory to save the created files create a Artifact to save in the dataset to be used later actual loop to create the dataset load the audio get features from the train_tp. com samcantor9 getting started with rainforest audio data by Sam Cantor https www. We are discarding train_fp. For clarity or more information on train_tp vs train_fp check out this disussion thread https www. The transformations are based on this Kaggle kernel https www. songtype_id is the same species using different frequencies as annotated. unique songtype_id initialize a W B run create an artifact to add file s and meaningful description. _Sneak Peak of our dataset version control_ img https i. com github wandb examples blob master colabs wandb artifacts Pipeline_Versioning_with_W 26B_Artifacts. Following this widely used and successful method this kernel builds an interesting image dataset using audio dataset. The reason for tp fp to not add up to the number of audion files is that there are some files annotated with tp as well as fp. csv file Get the postition to slice the audio spectrogram log_spectrogram mel_spectrogram generate image by stacking three transforms normalize image scale image to 0 1 scale up to 0 255 to save in bmp format convert to PIL Image and save in bmp format save the directory as an artifact Save the artifact version to W B let W B know that this run is complete. png Overview Generate multiple image datasets using different values of the hyperparameters n_fft and hop_length. csv and 7781 rows in train_fp. Since we are creating multiple dataset to experiment with dataset version control can be useful. We have two annotation files train_tp. Number of train and test audio recordsThe numbers don t add up and thus a closer look at the csv files is required. Dataset Creation and W B ArtifactsLearn more about the artifacts through this easy to understand Colab notebook https colab. Save the artifact version to W B and mark it as the output of this run which specie s does the sample audio file belong number of samples per FFT the duration of each slice shift normalize image high sr for less rounding errors this way length of slice initialize a W B run declare which artifact we ll be using we can eithr download the csv file from the artifact_csv or use the one which is opened. They will be used to generate the dataset to train our model. Prepare dataset and save as W B artifacts https www. Save the csv files as W B Artifacts Audio to Image TransformationsWe will quickly look at the standard audio to image transformation techniques.
