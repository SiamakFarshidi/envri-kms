We reduce the size of image. Increase nonlinearity. Reshape Train and test images 28 x 28 We reshape all data to 28x28x1 3D matrices. Fit the model Evaluate the model Test Loss visualization Confusion matrix Conclusion http scs. com kanncaa1 recurrent neural network with pytorch Conclusion 18 Loading the Data Set In this part we load and visualize the data. Keras needs an extra dimension in the end which correspond to channels. You have a batch size of 2 and you ve specified you want the algorithm to run for 3 epochs. input size and output size are same. It reduce the amount of parameters and computation in the network and hence to also control overfitting. This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed It is defined by the kaggle python docker image https github. In the early layers of our network we want to preserve as much information about the original input volume so that we can extract those low level features. For example running this by clicking run or pressing Shift Enter will list the files in the input directory Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output. This is important bc code runs faster. Convolutional Neural Network CNN is used for image classification object detection What is Convolution Operation We have some image and feature detector 3 3 Feature detector does not need to be 3 by 3 matrix. feature map conv input image feature detector. Each batch gets passed through the algorithm therefore you have 5 iterations per epoch. com questions 4752626 epoch vs iteration when training neural networks Data Augmentation To avoid overfitting problem we need to expand artificially our handwritten digit dataset Alter the training data with small transformations to reproduce the variations of digit. Label Encoding Encode labels to one hot vectors 2 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 Train Test Split We split the data into train and test sets. ca aharley vis conv flat. We create multiple feature maps bc we use multiple feature detectors filters. com kanncaa1 pytorch tutorial for deep learning lovers Recurrent Neural Network with Pytorch https www. Epochs and Batch Size Say you have a dataset of 10 examples or samples. Normalization Reshape and Label Encoding Normalization We perform a grayscale normalization to reduce the effect of illumination s differences. Because images are non linear. Max Pooling It makes down sampling or sub sampling Reduces the number of parameters It makes the detection of features invariant to scale or orientation changes. For example the number is not centered The scale is not the same some who write with big small numbers The image is rotated. That means that we have multi class. com kanncaa1 deep learning tutorial for beginners Artificial Neural Network with Pytorch https www. It can be 5 by 5 or 7 by 7. Therefore in each epoch you have 5 batches 10 2 5. Example if out input is dog feature detector can detect features like ear or tail of the dog. Element wise multiplication of matrices. html HW If you have any question I will be very happy to hear it. Same Padding As we keep applying conv layers the size of the volume will decrease faster than we would like. com kanncaa1 pytorch tutorial for deep learning lovers Convolutional Neural Network with Pytorch https www.

Feature detector kernel filter Feauture detector detects features like edges or convex shapes. Our images are gray scaled so it use only one channel. If we perform normalization CNN works faster. Flattening Full Connection Neurons in a fully connected layer have connections to all activations in the previous layer Artificial Neural Network Implementing with Keras Create Model conv max pool dropout conv max pool dropout fully connected 2 layer Dropout Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training Define Optimizer Adam optimizer Change the learning rate Compile Model categorical crossentropy We make binary cross entropy at previous parts and in machine learning tutorial At this time we use categorical crossentropy. read train read test put labels into y_train variable Drop label column visualize number of digits classes plot some samples plot some samples Normalize the data Reshape Label Encoding convert to one hot encoding Split the train and the validation set for the fitting Some examples convert to one hot encoding fully connected Define the optimizer Compile the model for better result increase the epochs data augmentation set input mean to 0 over the dataset set each sample mean to 0 divide inputs by std of the dataset divide each input by its std dimesion reduction randomly rotate images in the range 5 degrees Randomly zoom image 10 randomly shift images horizontally 10 randomly shift images vertically 10 randomly flip images randomly flip images Fit the model Plot the loss and accuracy curves for training and validation confusion matrix Predict the values from the validation dataset Convert predictions classes to one hot vectors Convert validation observations to one hot vectors compute the confusion matrix plot the confusion matrix.
