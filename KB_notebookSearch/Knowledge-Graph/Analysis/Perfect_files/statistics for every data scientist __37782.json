In simpler terms it means that almost 93 of the variance in the data set can be explained using the first principal component with measures of disp and hp. In the case of real valued data that does not fit the familiar Gaussian distribution or ordinal data or interval data nonparametric statistics are the only type of statistics that can be used. Example Average Height We measure the heights of 40 randomly chosen men and get a mean height of 175cm We also know the standard deviation of men s heights is 20cm. Let us try to look at the summary of this analysis. Type II error is opposite of Type I error. Pearson Correlation Coefficient is not robust to outliers Presence of outliers will always impace Pearson Correlation Coefficient value. Mean Add up the values in the data set and then divide by the number of values. Poisson Distribution Poisson random variable is typically used to model the distribution of events per unit of time or space. Correlation values are standardized whereas covariance values are not. Or p value corresponding to the green point point of intersection of green line and the curve tells us about the total probability of getting any value to the right hand side of the green line when the values are picked randomly from the population distribution. This means that we already know the distribution and we know its parameters. 80 85 sigma is the standard deviation n is the number of items in a sample. Fatter tails allow for a higher dispersion of variables as there is more uncertainty. Correlation Pearson s CorrelationBoth Covariance and Correlation measures the relationship and the dependency between two variables. 2465 Chi Square Value 2. Data Ranking is exactly as its name suggests. Quick Tip Multicollinearity can be handled by 1 Delete one of the perfectly correlated features. It assume that the two or more random variables are normally distributed. If we have parametric data we can use parametric methods and can harness the entire suite of statistical methods developed for data assuming a Gaussian distribution such as Summary statistics. As the z statistic is related to the standard Normal distribution the t statistic is related to the Student s T distribution. With the help of p value we not only made a simpler model with fewer variables but we also improved the model s performance. You can basically change the two values here and the third value fixes itself. Hypothesis Null Hypothesis The independent variable has no significant effect over the target variable. Data could be non parametric for many reasons such as Data is not real valued but instead is ordinal intervals or some other form. The samples are not independent therefore the Mann Whitney U test cannot be used. Alternate Hypothesis The independent variables have a significant effect on the target variable. Covariance indicates the direction of the linear relationship between variables whereas Correlation measures both the magnitude and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. Statistical Estimators Statistical Estimators Central Tendency Central Tendency Mean Mean Median Median Mode Mode Variance Variance Standard deviation Standard deviation Covariance Covariance Correlation Pearson s Correlation Correlation Pearson s Correlation Standard Error Standard Error Probability Distributions Probability Distributions Gausian Normal distribution Gausian Normal distribution Standard Normal distribution Standard Normal distribution Student s T Distribution Student s T Distribution Binomial Distribution Binomial Distribution Bernoulli s Distribution Bernoulli s Distribution Uniform Distribution Uniform Distribution Exponential Distribution Exponential Distribution Poisson Distribution Poisson Distribution Probability Density Function and Probability Mass Function Probability Density Function and Probability Mass Function P value P value Degrees of Freedom Degrees of Freedom Parametric vs. 2093 Female Yes 44 38 0. To talk about a null hypothesis being true using a p value is impossible. html Null Hypothesis for ttest_rel is That 2 related or repeated samples have identical average expected values. As a result these values can be obtained with fairly high probability. It is a way to describe the center of a data set. Two variables being considered may have a non Gaussian distribution. Probability Density Function and Probability Mass Function Probability density function and Probability mass function is a statistical expression that defines a Probability Distribution for a random variable. 95 fall within two standard deviations. With this information we can easily interpret the key variable in the PC. Example a company production is 50 unit per day etc. Build a Contingency table. p value alpha The orange point has a p value greater than the alpha. In a Probability Distribution graph we have the range of values on the x axis and the frequency of occurrences of different values on the y axis. text Spearman s Correlation Coefficient frac Covariance rank x rank y stdv rank x stdv rank y Chi Squared Test Chi Square Test is used in statistics to test whether two non negative features boolean category non negative numbers are related or independent. For example the distribution of sum of heights of all men in a region tends towards a Gaussian probability distribution. Whereas the Probability Mass Function PMF is used to determine the probability distribution for a Discrete Random Variable. It can assume both positive or negative. Any successful event should not influence the outcome of another successful event. Neutral Correlation No relationship in the change of the variables. This says the true mean 95 of times of ALL men population is likely to be between 168. The value of correlation is not influenced by the change in scale of the values. It has dropped from 92. 5 indicates a notable correlation and values below those values suggests a less notable correlation. The t distribution has been used as a reference for the distribution of a sample mean the difference between two sample means regression parameters and other statistics. An example is Logistic Regression or Linear Regression. We will draw the samples from Gaussian distributions for simplicity although as noted the tests we review are for data samples where we do not know or assume any specific distribution. Let us now look at the principal component loading vectors To help with the interpretation let us plot these results. If all the values of the given variable are multiplied by a constant and all the values of another variable are multiplied by a similar or different constant then the value of covariance also changes. The red point in this distribution represents the alpha value or the threshold p value. text Z frac x mu sigma We use the letter Z to denote standardization. On the other hand the contribution of PC2 has increased from 7 to 22. A distribution is called Poisson distribution when the following assumptions are valid 1. 8181 Male No 178 172 0. Student s T Distribution T Distribution or Student s T Distribution is a probability distribution that is used to estimate population parameters when the sample size is small 30. first array represents chi square values and second array represnts p values. Since the probability 0. PCA with correlation matrix This plot looks more informative. This is a useful shorthand but strictly this is not entirely accurate. The two variables are positively correlated and the correlation is 0. The life of an Air Conditioner. Decision trees and boosted trees algorithms are immune to multicollinearity by nature. This result is often against the alternate hypothesis obtained results are from another distribution. Z is known as the z score. Standard ErrorThe standard error of the mean also called the standard deviation of the mean tells us how accurate the mean of any given sample from that population is likely to be compared to the true population mean. When we divide the covariance values by the standard deviation it scales the value down to a limited range of 1 to 1 that represents the limits of correlation from a full negative correlation to a full positive correlation. Spearman s Rank Correlation Spearman s Correlation is used when Two variables are may be related by a nonlinear relationship such that the relationship is stronger or weaker across the distribution of the variables. Calculate the standard deviation of all the means. 7 and all other principal components have progressively lower contribution. linspace 0 100 101 rank data review first 10 ranked samples Random numbers drawn from a Gaussian distribution with mean 100 and standard deviation 20. As a result the sample results are a rare outcome. If we move away from the peak the occurrence of the values decreases rapidly and so does the corresponding probability towards a very small value close to zero. Same Probability Probability of head in a toss 0. The first principal component here on the left and right corresponds to the measure of disp and hp. Often parametric is shorthand for real valued data drawn from a Gaussian distribution. In general the findings from nonparametric methods are less powerful than their parametric counterparts namely because they must be generalized to work for all types of data. The sign of the covariance shows the tendency in the linear relationship between the variables. Find the Expected Value Based on the null hypothesis that the two variables are independent. text Median frac n 1 2 Mode Value in the data set which occurs most often. Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test If the the data samples are paired in some way or represent two measurements of the same technique or each sample is independent but comes from the same population we use Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test. A higher Chi Square value indicates that the feature is more dependent on the response and can be selected for model training. 05 we can discard the null hypothesis. Significance tests for comparing means. Gausian Normal distribution Normal Distribution is useful because of the Central Limit Theorem CLT which states that when a large number of simple random samples are selected from the population and the mean is calculated for each then the distribution of these sample means will assume the normal probability distribution. t frac bar x mu frac sigma sqrt n bar x Sample Mean mu Population Mean sigma standard deviation n sample size Binomial Distribution This type of distribution is used when there are exactly two outcomes of a trial. It is the square root of variance. 100 accuracy is not possible for accepting or rejecting a hypothesis so we therefore select a level of significance that is usually 5 which means the output should be 95 confident to give similar kind of result in each sample. Calculate the Chi Square statistic. Another significant difference can be observed if we look at the standard deviation values in both the results above. The scale measure is set as FALSE as specified by in the input arguments. 2214 Accept or Reject the Null Hypothesis The Chi Square value is greater than alpha 0. 1107 44 We also calculated E2 E3 E4 and get the following results. A high p value means that our data is highly consistent with our null hypothesis nothing more. The random variable X can take value 1 with the probability of success p and the value 0 with the probability of failure q or 1 p. 9 Each trial is independent since the outcome of the previous toss doesn t determine or affect the outcome of the current toss. SE bar x frac sigma_x sqrt n Confidence IntervalsA Confidence Interval is a range of values we are fairly sure our true value eg. mean or median is statistically significant. sdev shows the standard deviation of principal components. This in turn affects the importance of the variables computed for any further analyses. Covariance and Correlation Statistical Analysis Covariance Matrix The Covariance matrix of X_ NP is a P P matrix where the covariance of any two features P1 P2 is calculated by the formula Cov P1 P2 frac sum P1 _i bar P1 P2 _i bar P2 N For diagonal elements Cov P1 P1 Var P1 Correlation Matrix The Correlation matrix of X_ NP is also a P P matrix where the correlation of any two features P1 P2 is calculated by the formula Corr P1 P2 frac Cov P1 P2 sigma_ P1 sigma_ P2 The correlation of an element with itself Corr P1 P1 1 or the highest value possible. Variance of zero indicates that all of the data values are identical. Multivariate Statistical Analysis Multivariate statistics includes all statistical techniques for analyzing samples made of two or more variables. The probability of success over a short interval must equal the probability of success over a longer interval. There are three measures of central tendency the mean the median and the mode. Contingency table Gender Exited Yes No Total Male 38 178 216 Female 44 140 184 Total 82 318 400 Degrees of freedom for contingency table is given as r 1 c 1 where r c are rows and columns. If we pick any random value from this distribution the probability that we will pick values close to the mean is highest as it has the highest peak due to high occurrence values in that region. The most important thing to note in this model summary is that although we have reduced two independent variables the value of the adjusted R Square is increased. These outcomes are labeled as Success and Failure. Alternative hypothesis The alternative hypothesis is the hypothesis that is contrary to the null hypothesis. This suggests a high level of correlation. One significant change we see is the drop in the contribution of PC1 to the total variation. Length of time between arrivals at a gas station. Draw n samples from a population. The center and scale provide the respective means and standard deviation of the variables that were used for normalization before implementing PCA. The degree of freedom here is 2. The component loading can be represented as the correlation of a particular variable on the respective PC principal component. This analysis with the correlation matrix definitely uncovers some better structure in the data and relationships between variables. Essentially degrees of freedom is the number of independent data points that went into calculating the estimate. Mann Whitney U Test In Mann Whitney U Test the two samples are combined and rank ordered together. Example The number of emergency calls recorded at a hospital in a day. These Z scores are important because they tell us how far a value is from the mean. The number of customers arriving at a salon in an hour. The Kruskal Wallis test is a nonparametric version of the one way analysis of ANOVA. Most parametric methods have an equivalent nonparametric version. bar x frac sum x_i n Median List the values of the data set in numerical order ascending descending and identify which value appears in the middle of the list. Since the data is normalized the units correspond to the number of standard deviations away of the data from the mean. Correlation Tests Covariance Analysis The covariance between the two variables is 389. Stationary Tests Augmented Dickey Fuller Kwiatkowski Phillips Schmidt Shin Parametric Statistical Hypothesis Tests Student s t test A common question about two or more datasets is whether they are same different. We expect the statistical tests to discover that the samples were drawn from differing distributions. Bernoulli s Distribution Bernoulli Distribution is a special case of Binomial Distribution with a single trial. It is the average of the squared distances from each point to the mean. Or A Probability Distribution is a mathematical function that can be thought of as providing the probabilities of occurrence of different possible outcomes in an experiment. The probabilities of success and failure need not be equally likely. p value alpha The pink point has a p value less than the alpha value red. Define Hypothesis Null Hypothesis H0 Two variables are independent. Standard Normal distribution When we standardize a random variable its mean becomes 0 and its standard deviation becomes 1. When a Normal Distribution is standardized the result is called a Standard Normal Distribution. Probability density function PDF is used to determine the probability distribution for a Continuous Random Variable. D Agostino s K 2 Test Test the null hypothesis that the data is drawn from a normal distribution. Chi Square measures how expected count E and observed count O deviates each other. Non Parametric Data Data that does not fit a known or well understood distribution is referred to as nonparametric data. A discrete uniform distribution will take a finite set of values S and assign a probability of 1 n to each of them where n is the amount of elements in S. We choose the significance level before we perform the experiment. The performance of some algorithms can deteriorate if two or more variables are tightly related called multicollinearity. It is an assumption that we make about the population parameter. If the Z score of x is zero then the value of x is equal to the mean. Degrees of Freedom To explain what degrees of freedom are let us just take an example. This way if for instance a variable Y is uniform in 1 2 3 there d be 33 chance for each of those values to be assigned to Y. The smaller the value of alpha we consider the harder it is to consider the results as significant. Test Dataset Generate two samples drawn from different distributions. 8 of success is greater than 0. We will use the prcomp function from the stats package. Steps to perform the Chi Square Test Define Hypothesis. Negative Correlation variables change in opposite directions. Accept or Reject the Null Hypothesis. Anderson Darling Test Test the null hypothesis that the data is drawn from a particular distribution. The probability of success in an interval approaches zero as the interval becomes smaller. With any set of 3 numbers with the same mean for example 12 8 and 10 or say 9 10 and 11 there is only one value for any 2 given values in the set. Spearman s Correlation can also be used if there is a linear relationship between the variables but may result in lower coefficient scores. It is the distribution of the difference between an estimated parameter and its true or assumed value divided by the standard deviation of the estimated parameter standard error. mean standard deviation mean standard deviation mean standard deviation size number of times to repeat the trials. Alpha value Significance LevelAlpha value Significance Level generally 0. the null hypothesis is true but is rejected. The distribution follows Normal Distribution when the sample size is sufficiently large. 2 Use a dimension reduction algorithm such as Principle Component Analysis PCA. In other words it shows the square roots of the eigenvalues. To read this chart one has to look at the extreme ends top down left and right. Setting the scale FALSE option will use the covariance matrix to get the PCs Setting the scale FALSE option will use the correlation matrix to get the PCs obtain the rootation matrix obtain the biplot correlation matrix method pearson kendall spearman. qsec gear and am have a significant contribution to PC2. The procedure is as follows Sort all data in the sample in ascending order. As a conclusion not a lot of significant insights can be driven from the Principal Component Analysis on the basis of the covariance matrix. When two features are independent the observed count is close to the expected count thus we will have smaller Chi Square value. An experiment with only two possible outcomes repeated n number of times is called binomial. In a set of 3 numbers with the mean as 10 and two out of three variables as 5 and 15 there is only one possibility of the value that the third number can take up i. We will also see how PCA results differ when computed with the correlation matrix and the covariance matrix respectively. The greater the magnitude of T the greater the evidence against the null hypothesis. Covariance and Correlation Statistical Analysis in PCA In PCA analysis use the covariance matrix when the variable are on similar scales and the correlation matrix when the scales of the variables differ. Non Parametric Data Parametric vs. Student s T distribution looks much like a Normal distribution but generally has fatter tails. Data is almost parametric but contains outliers multiple peaks a shift or some other feature. Data Ranking Before a nonparametric statistical method can be applied the data must be converted into a rank format. Furthermore the component loading values show that the relationship between the variables in the data set is way more structured and distributed. Correlation between variables. We can say if A B are two independent events P A land B P A text P B Let s calculate the expected value for the first cell that is those who are Males and are Exited from the bank. It is the equivalent of the paired Student T test but for ranked data instead of real valued data with a Gaussian distribution. Now let s say that the orange and pink points represent different sample results obtained after an experiment. Uniform Distribution There are two kinds of uniform random variables discrete and continuous ones. Variance Variance measures how far a set of data is spread out. The strategy is to determine if the values from the two samples are randomly mixed in the rank ordering or if they are clustered at opposite ends when combined. Applications compare the performance of two workers of by checking the average sales done by each of them. draw a scatterplot first to check a linear relationship. Remarks Although a low p value promotes the rejection of the null hypothesis it addresses nothing about the probability of rejecting it. The values from PCA done using the correlation matrix are closer to each other and more uniform as compared to the analysis done using the covariance matrix. In the above table we have figured out all observed values and our next steps is to find expected values get the Chi Square value and check for relationship. The number of printing errors at each page of the book. Cov \ud835\udc4b \ud835\udc4c frac sum x_i bar x y_i bar y N 1 Cov \ud835\udc4b \ud835\udc4b Var \ud835\udc4b Cov \ud835\udc4b \ud835\udc4c Cov \ud835\udc4c \ud835\udc4b The use of the mean in the calculation suggests the need for each data sample to have a Gaussian or Gaussian like distribution. The magnitude of the covariance is not easily interpreted. 5 Different Probability Probability of me winning with superman 0. A value of 0 means no correlation. Specifically whether the simplarity difference between their central tendency e. It also means that the results are in favor of the null hypothesis and therefore we fail to reject it. Analysis of Variance Test ANOVA ANOVA is a statistical test that assumes that the mean across 2 or more groups are equal. A hypothesis test evaluates two mutually exclusive statements about a population to determine which statement is best supported by the sample data. Therefore they are significantly different from the population. text Chi Square sum frac O_i E_i 2 E_i text O Observed values E Expected Values In feature selection we aim to select the features which are highly dependent on the response y. compare the performance of a worker by comparing the average sales done by him with the standard value. 1107 E_1 400 text 0. When the standard error increases i. Covariance measures the degree to which two variables are linearly associated. Instead of calculating the coefficient using covariance and standard deviations on the samples themselves Spearman s Correlation is calculated from the relative rank of values on each sample. These data samples are repeated or dependent and are referred to as paired samples or repeated measures. The parameters of a binomial distribution are N and P where N is the total number of trials and P is the probability of success in each trial. The variances of the two samples may be assumed to be equal or unequal. A random rank order would mean that the two samples are not different while a cluster of one sample values would indicate a difference between them. If the p value satisfies our level of significance p alpha only then can we make conclusions. In general we prefer to work with parametric data and even go so far as to use data preparation methods that make data parametric such as data transforms so that we can harness these well understood statistical methods. The value of covariance is affected by the change in scale of the variables. Exponential Distribution Exponential Distribution measures the distribution of the time between events. Univariate Statistical Analysis Normality Tests Statistical tests to check if the data has a Gaussian distribution. A Distribution is a function that shows the possible values for a variable and how often they occur. Divide by the number of samples observed. 5 the distribution is skewed towards the right side. Here df 2 1 2 1 1. The closer T is to 0 the more likely there isn t a significant difference. Nonparametric Statistical Hypothesis Tests The null hypothesis of these tests is often the assumption that both samples were drawn from a population with the same distribution and therefore the same population parameters such as mean or median. Example Consider a data set where we have to determine why customers are leaving the bank. The standardized value i. Calaulate the mean of every sample. 68 of the data falls within the first standard deviation from the mean. Kruskal Wallis H Test Generalization of Mann Whitney U test. Non Parametric Data Parametric Data Parametric Data Non Parametric Data Non Parametric Data Univariate Statistical Analysis Univariate Statistical Analysis Normality Tests Normality Tests Shapiro Wilk Test Shapiro Wilk Test D Agostino s K 2 Test D Agostino s K 2 Test Anderson Darling Test Anderson Darling Test Correlation Tests Correlation Tests Covariance Analysis Covariance Analysis Pearson s Correlation Coefficient Pearson s Correlation Coefficient Spearman s Rank Correlation Spearman s Rank Correlation Chi Squared Test Chi Squared Test Parametric Statistical Hypothesis Tests Parametric Statistical Hypothesis Tests Student s t test Student s t test Analysis of Variance Test ANOVA Analysis of Variance Test Nonparametric Statistical Hypothesis Tests Nonparametric Statistical Hypothesis Tests Mann Whitney U Test Mann Whitney U Test Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test Kruskal Wallis H Test Kruskal Wallis H Test Friedman Test Friedman Test Multivariate Statistical Analysis Multivariate Statistical Analysis Covariance and Correlation Statistical Analysis Covariance and Correlation Statistical Analysis Statistical Estimators Central Tendency A measure of central tendency is a single value that describes the way in which a group of data cluster around a central value. Term in denominator N 1 indicates the degrees of freedom. If the evidence suggests that this is not the case the null hypothesis is rejected and at least one data sample has a different distribution. Higher the loading value higher is the correlation. In this test we will check is there any relationship between Gender and Exited. Probability DistributionsIn statistics when we use the term Distribution it usually means Probability distribution. Term in numerator is called the sum of cross products. Friedman Test Generalization of the Kruskal Wallis H Test to more than two samples. The QQ Plot orders the z scores from low to high and plots each value s z score on the y axis the x axis is the corresponding quantile of a normal distribution for that value s rank. Alternate Hypothesis H1 Two variables are not independent. The number of thefts reported in an area on a day. PCA with covariance matrix prcomp returns 5 key measures sdev rotation center scale and x. 05 or 5 is a threshold p value which we decide before conducting a test of similarity or significance Z test or a T test. sigma 2 frac sum x_i bar x 2 N Standard deviation Standard Deviation measures the absolute variability of a datasets distribution. Shapiro Wilk Test Test the null hypothesis that the data is drawn from a normal distribution. The second principal component PC2 does not seem to have a strong measure. The matrix x has the principal component score vectors. Length of time beteeen metro arrivals 2. 9473 Female No 140 146 0. Find the expected values. Since Geography has higher the p value it says that the variable is independent of the repsone and may not be considered for model training. When the PDF is graphically plotted the area under the curve indicates the interval in which the variable will fall. Level of significance Refers to the degree of significance in which we accept or reject the null hypothesis. Student s t test compares the means of two independent groups in order to determine if the two population means are equal. It is used more often than variance because the unit in which it is measured is the same as that of mean a measure of central tendency. Example a company production is 50 unit per day. Each column of the rotation matrix contains the principal component loading vector. ExampleWe can clearly see that Administration has a p value over 0. 7 fall within three standard deviations. Correlation Matrix for to compare feature correlations Q AQ What is the difference between type I vs type II error A Type I error False Positive when a girl is not pregnant but the doctor has stated that she is pregnant. The above example can be used to conclude that the results significantly differ when one tries to define variable relationships using covariance and correlation. We can see that it is positive suggesting the variables change in the same direction as we expect. Assign an integer rank from 1 to N for each unique value in the data sample. It assume that the two random variables are normally distributed. the means are more spread out it becomes more likely that any given mean is an inaccurate representation of the true population mean. generate gaussian data samples generate two sets of univariate observations summarize interpret interpret interpret interpret rpy2 runs embedded R in a Python process. Examples of paired samples in machine learning might be the same algorithm evaluated on different datasets or different algorithms evaluated on exactly the same training and test data. Pearson s Correlation Coefficient Pearson Correlation Coefficient can be used with Continuous variables that have a linear relationship. We can finish this analysis with a summary of the PCA with the covariance matrix From this table we see that the maximum contribution to variation caused is caused by PC1 92. p value is the cumulative probability area under the curve of the values right of the green line in the figure above. Data is real valued but does not fit a well understood shape. Non Parametric Data Parametric Data Parametric data is a sample of data drawn from a known data distribution. import uniform distribution Decreasing Exponential Function mu The average number of events in an interval. Null hypothesis A null hypothesis is a general statement or default position. The number of suicides reported in a particular city. P value Hypothesis testing Hypothesis testing is a statistical method that is used in making statistical decisions using experimental data. Consider the above normal distribution. Gaussian noise added with a mean of a 50 and a standard deviation of 10 summarize plot Select all Categorical variables and dependent variable Use ttest_rel when the data samples may represent two independent measures or evaluations of the same object. In the scipy documents https docs. Corr_ xy frac Cov \ud835\udc4b \ud835\udc4c sigma_x sigma_y Types of correlations Positive Correlation both variables change in the same direction. QQ Plot A QQ Plot is used to visually determine how close a sample is to the normal distribution. Gender of a customer with values as Male Female as the predictor X and Exited describes whether a customer is leaving the bank with values Yes No as the response y. In a continuous uniform distribution probability of Y taking a value in an interval from c to d is proportional to its size versus the size of the whole interval b a. Importantly the test can only comment on whether all samples are the same or not it cannot quantify which samples differ or by how much. If the points roughly fall on the diagonal line then the sample distribution can be considered close to normal. Given the data of two variables we can get observed count O and expected count E. We will see R code how Covariance and Correlation Matrix can be used to explain which features contributes to maximum variance in PCA analysis. Let s remove this variable from the model. Covariance can take any value between and. sigma sqrt sigma 2 Covariance Covariance is a measure of how change in one variable is associated with change in a second variable. Gender Exited Yes No Male 44 172 Female 38 146 Calculate Chi Square value Gender Exited O E frac O E 2 E Male Yes 38 44 0. The 95 Confidence Interval is 175cm 6. As with the Pearson correlation coefficient the scores are between 1 and 1 for perfectly negatively correlated variables and perfectly positively correlated respectively. text Confidence interval bar X pm Z frac sigma sqrt n Where bar X is the mean Z is the z value calculated from a table for a confidence interval eg. Selection of predictors and independent variables is one prominent application of such exercises. ttest is the calculated difference of the population mean represented in units of standard error. The above results show that Administration has no significant effect over the Profit earned by the startups. org doc scipy reference generated scipy. E_1 N text P P P yes text P male P frac 82 400 text frac 216 400 P 0. It says that variables like disp cyl hp wt mpg drat and vs contribute significantly to PC1 first principal component. 05 we accept the null hypothesis. A large p value implies that sample scores are more aligned or similar to the population score. The Friedman test is the nonparametric version of the repeated measures analysis of variance test or repeated measures ANOVA.
