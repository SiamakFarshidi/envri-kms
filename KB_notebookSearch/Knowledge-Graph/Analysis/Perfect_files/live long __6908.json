There is a number of similar indicators fitting about the same e. For the Life Expectancy I took Life expectancy at birth total years indicator average for both genders. Though country wise histogram looks good enough. TODO Perform Ridge or Lasso multi vriate analysis with test set cross validationThen I listed the indicators sorted by absolute value of correlation large to small. What does make those different School enrollment secondary net The biggest surprise of the paper. Country histogram is dreadful comparable number of countries have strong negative and strong positive correlation.

This is rather an artifact of several global trends coinciding. ZS Agriculture value added of GDP 0. NENR School enrollment secondary net 0. The calculation processsing takes roughly half an hour. IN Birth rate crude per 1 000 people 0. Out of 247 countries 100 countries fit nearly perfect 80 to 100 majority of others are 50 to 80 a handful of countries have weak positive correlation below 30 there are no countries with positive moderate or strong correlationBoth domain and range are wide making the tendency even more cinvincive. Open questions for possible futher investigation what does make exceptional countries with moderate positive relationship for each birth rate value still there is 20 years worth gap between top and bottom. DSE200x Mini Project Q What Does Influence Life Expectancy the Most What does help us to live longer or to die earlier Among hundreds of indicators in the data set let s find the most titghly bound to the life expectancy. Stored the indicator name as long as its correlation is at least 0. The indicator is available for 203 countries only. Relative abundance of old years dots in the lower left prompts the smaller contribution of agriculture is no guarantee for a better life expectancy. For the measure of statistical relationship I took determination coefficien by countries and years no aggregation. Less then 10 lines tell nothing can be anywhere between 40 and 80 years. 50 of agriculture and more assures life expectancy under 55 however in recent years there is a handful of countries reaching 50 see yelow dots On the other hand lower agriculture contribution says little expectancy can be anywhere between 40 and 75 years.

Agriculture value added of GDP Looking at the spread width and not as good correlation I suggest this is merely a coincidence of two global trends 1. Please take a look below at the per country examples for how diverse the dependency is. P2 Fixed telephone subscriptions per 100 people 0. Wealth only explains 41 of difference in life expectancy. Fixed telephone subscriptions per 100 people Graph and histogram say indicator is positively and strongly bound to the life expectancy however it is far from linear.
