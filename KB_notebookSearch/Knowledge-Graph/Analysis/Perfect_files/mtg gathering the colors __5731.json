It started to release more frequently with less cards per release. I think this is dirty data. Power distributionX axis starts at power 0. the axes frame to draw correctly for a polygon frame. For example Counterspell seems to me like the typical blue spell. And Black Blue and Green White are more frequent. In the middle of 2007 Wizards of the Coast changed its strategy. White has lots of power 2 which are probably variations of humans. Exhibit C the edge case when both colors and colorIdentity are missing 1. Settings Read Data Remove Outliers Preprocess Colors Co occurrences Correlation Heatmap Interactive Time Series of Releases Cumulative Color Proportion Over Time New in version 13 Mana distribution Power distribution Toughness distribution Interactive 2D Histogram of Power vs Toughness Radar charts SettingsWe define a mapping between the colorIdentity and color columns so that we can combine the information from both when we categorize cards by color. Creatures Mana distributionX axis is a little weird. Notice how multi colored creatures tend to survive longer. Each radar shows the distribution of cards into 5 types with every circle denoting 10. Green has more power 4 which is expected since it relies more on creatures to win. Blue has less creatures and more instant spells to control the board state. Exhibit A the edge case when colors is missing but colorIdentity is not 1. Multi color creatures tend to cost more to cast since they usually have better abilities. Truly colorless artifacts like Leonin Scimitar. This is further evidence of its reliance on instants and sorceries instead of creatures. Truly colorless artifact creatures like Juggernaut. Exhibit B the edge case when colorIdentity is missing but colors is not 1. Interactive 2D Histogram of Power vs ToughnessI could not get the colors to work correctly but the hover text is alphabetical by color. For simple visualizations we have to make some simplifications. And to reduce data size we limit the data to columns specified in keeps. There are also relatively more colorless artifacts with power 0. html Radar ChartWe will look at how the distribution of card types varies by mana color. I m not a MTG expert so maybe there is some rule I m not aware of. There should not be a gap at 0. remove promo cards that aren t used in normal play Edit 2016 09 30 Could be null because it s too new to have a ruling on it. We ll assign colors to exhibits A and B below but not to C. Red has relatively thicker tail which is expected since it emphasizes attack. Toughness distributionX axis starts at toughness 0. Is there a better way of grouping. get counts calculate evenly spaced axis angles rotate theta such that the first axis is at the top unit circle centered on 0. In addition since it relies more on enchantments the inherent power of the creatures are not as high. Eldrazi creatures that need a specific color mana to cast but is Deviod of a color type. org examples api radar_chart. For example Serra Angel needs white mana to cast and should count as white for Protection From White. 5 use 1 line segment to connect specified points define draw_frame method FIXME markers at x 0 y 0 get doubled up The following is a hack to get the spines i. Blue has relatively little mana 1 creatures. White has relatively more enchantments to buff the creatures. Unlike other colors blue peaks earlier at power 1. Black has more expendable creatures congruent with its abilities to interact with the graveyard. Radar Charts Mono color decksColorless cards are more or less artifacts. Most start with 1 mana. Some data fu to get all cards into a single table along with a couple of release columns. Green has more toughness 5 which is expected since it relies more on creatures for protection. Radar Charts Tri color decksValues are percentages so 100 artifacts does not mean there are lots of artifacts of that color. Notice how there were less multi colored cards in the beginning compared to colorless cards. Artifacts that do not need colored mana to cast but activations associated with colored mana. Exception is Colorless which start at 0. spine_type must be left right top bottom or circle. Green s creatures are spread across the mana costsThis is consistent with its reliance on creatures in its strategy. Read Data Remove Outliers Preprocess ColorA core part of Magic The Gathering MTG is how different rules interact with each other. In 2008 multi colored decks became better established with clearly defined play styles and decks. Co occurrences Correlation HeatmapEasier to see that Blue and Green combos are relatively rare. Recommened use zoom in for a better resolution exit zoom mode into pan mode hover over the markers for counts Cumulative Color Proportion Over TimeWe can also look at the cumulative color proportions over time releases. Red emphasizes more on speed mana cost and attack instead of sustainability. Red has relatively low number of creatures with 2 mana but more with 3 or 4 mana. Radar chart factoryCode from http matplotlib. Radar Charts Dual color decksValues are percentages so 100 artifacts does not mean there are lots of artifacts of that color. Black and red have more toughness 2. Green focuses on creatures. I used cumulative proportions to smooth over the variations that could be present in individual releases. close off polygon by repeating first vertex Do not double count creatures Some double counting of artifacts and enchantments exist but it s rare. Since then the color distribution has been fairly stable. Interactive Time Series of ReleasesWe can look at the color distribution over time releases. IntroductionIn this notebook we give a high level look into the 5 core mana colors. Radar Charts Multi color decksValues are percentages so 100 artifacts does not mean there are lots of artifacts of that color.
