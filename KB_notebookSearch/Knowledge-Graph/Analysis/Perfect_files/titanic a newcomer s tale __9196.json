Extract important variables4. I picked the Gaussian Naive Bayes because it is the simplest and the most popular one. The model in this case is a Binary Classification problem meaning the output of this model is either a class 0 or a class 1. Gaussian Naive BayesThe Gaussian Naive Bayes is one classifier model. predict x_test confusion_matrix y_test y_pred print LR. score x_test y_test print AdaBoost_estimator. So I clubbed most of the ML algorithms. Modelling The process of training an ML model involves providing an ML algorithm that is the learning algorithm with training data to learn from. Some good references https en. ML would train an ML model by using this data resulting in a model that attempts to predict whether new email will be spam or not spam. Categorical qualitative data are pieces of information that allow us to classify the objects under investigation into various categories. Exploratory Data Analysis Exploratory Data Analysis Exploratory Data Analysis EDA is an approach philosophy for data analysis that employs a variety of techniques mostly graphical to1. predict x_test print accuracy_score y_pred y_test select_model. In all fairness even experts in the field are divided on this question so I used a mixture of both. Beside the Gaussian Naive Bayes there are also existing the Multinomial naive Bayes and the Bernoulli naive Bayes. ID3 Iterative Dichotomiser 3 uses Entropy function and Information gain as metrics. predict x_test extraTree_accy round accuracy_score y_pred y_test 3 select_model. append voting_accy. read_csv Input data files are available in the. We assume that P C A is Guassian following normal distribution. Embedding and Exploring https i. Determine optimal factor settings. Determining the missing dataMissing data can occur because of nonresponse no information is provided for one or more items or for a whole unit. Now that I have decided what kind of problems I need to boil this down to let s look at our dataset. Decision TreeA decision tree is a tree where each node represents a feature attribute each link branch represents a decision rule and each leaf represents an outcome categorical or continues value. jpg KERNEL Making In progress 1. It s an S shaped curve that can take any real valued number and map it into a value between 0 and 1 but never exactly at those limits. append accuracy_score y_pred y_test y_pred ExtraTreesClassifier. e normal distribution. In this case the dataframe called Title has been recategorized to 4 values Mr Mrs Miss Master. K Neighbors Classifier k Nearest Neighbors k NN is a supervised machine learning model. For this as of now I use the median to fill the values or the most frequent to fill NA values. Test underlying assumptions6. The logistic function also called the sigmoid function was developed by statisticians to describe properties of population growth in ecology rising quickly and maxing out at the carrying capacity of the environment. fit x_train y_train print SVC_grid. append AdaBoost_estimator. A supervised learning model takes in a set of input objects and output values. You would provide ML with training data that contains emails for which you know the target that is a label that tells whether an email is spam or not spam. org wiki Missing_datahttps machinelearningmastery. Bayes Thorem https i. You can use the ML model to get predictions on new data for which you do not know the target. The training data must contain the correct answer which is known as a target or target attribute. SVMs are more commonly used in classification problems and as such this is what we will focus on in this post. It s also assumed that all the features are following a gaussian distribution i. score x_test y_test confusion_matrix y_pred y_test grid_search. score x_test y_test print GBayes_clf. Logistic RegressionLogistic regression produces a logistic curve which is limited to values between 0 and 1. score x_test y_test y_pred GaussianProcessClassifier. predict x_test print grid_KNNsearch. We use sklearn s GaussianNB module but first lets recap to what Bayes theorem doesLet s break the equation below down 1. Logistic regression is similar to a linear regression but the curve is constructed using the natural logarithm of the odds of the target variable rather than the probability. com python example 93356 sklearn. CART Classification and Regression Trees uses Gini Index Classification as metric. score x_test y_test y_pred voting_classifier. Quantitative data are responses that are numerical in nature and with which we can perform meaningful arithmetic calculations. It s specifically used when the features have continuous values. predict x_test voting_accy accuracy_score y_pred y_test print voting_accy select_model. There are couple of algorithms there to build a decision tree we only talk about a few which are 1. So how many made the cut Turns out very few lived 61 Died. It involves the creation and study of the visual representation of data. Uncover underlying structure3. Encoding and Categorizing DataOnce we have gathered data we might wish to classify it. Remember this is just for training data. Hyper plane will be a point in case of 1 dimensional data line in case of 2 dimensional data plane in case of 3 dimensional data and so on. Decidion Tree https i. MatplotlibMy focus now is to see for myself what kind of relationship the data has with other data that may belong to the same or different category. P A B is the probability A under the condition B. append grid_KNNsearch. But first I had to decide whether this task was going to be a done by a supervised ML Algorithm or unsupervised ML algorithm. Roughly speaking data can be classified as categorical data or quantitative data. Statistical graphics is a collection of techniques all graphically based and all focusing on one data characterization aspect. Then we perform classification by finding the optimal hyper plane that differentiate the two classes very well. Data VisualizationData visualization is viewed by many disciplines as a modern equivalent of visual communication. The data point is then assigned the label of the majority of the k closest points. Gaussian Naive BayesA Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm is a special type of NB algorithm. So first we need to find the missing data and fill or replace the missing data with value. The learning algorithm finds patterns in the training data that map the input data attributes to the target the answer that you want to predict and it outputs an ML model that captures these patterns. append extraTree_accy print extraTree_accy print rf_grid. fit x_train y_train y_pred LR. score x_test y_test confusion_matrix y_pred y_test grid_KNNsearch. I use two highly effective libraries herea. In this algorithm we plot each data item as a point in n dimensional space where n is number of features you have with the value of each feature being the value of a particular coordinate. fit x_train y_train y_pred grid_KNNsearch. EDA is not a mere collection of techniques EDA is a philosophy as to how we dissect a data set what we look for how we look and how we interpret. Maximize insight into a data set2. Remember that P C is not calculated for our data. The whole idea is to create a tree like this for the entire data and process a single outcome at every leaf or minimize the error in every leaf. EDA encompasses a larger venue EDA is an approach to data analysis that postpones the usual assumptions about what kind of model the data follow with the more direct approach of allowing the data itself to reveal its underlying structure and model. The model then trains on that data to learn how to map the inputs to the desired output so it can learn to make predictions on unseen data. Titanic https i. For example let s say that you want to train an ML model to predict if an email is spam or not spam. For example if k 5 and 3 of points are green and 2 are red then the data point in question would be labeled green since green is the majority. Detect outliers and anomalies5. Moreover the predictors do not have to be normally distributed or have equal variance in each group. score x_test y_test select_model. Develop parsimonious models7. k NN models work by taking a data point and looking at the k closest labeled data points. P A and P B P B not 0 are the probabilities of the event independent from each other. extract values do not drop passenger id dependent variable replace nan with most frequent replace nan with median replace nan with most frequent replace nan with median encoding and categorizng data plot how many survive Title PClass vs Survived Fitting the models LR. In reality it was even worst 68 people on board died. Introduction The aim of the competition is to correctly predict the survival rate of Titanic Survivors. or incase of an unsupervised problem is it a clustering task or an association task. It is true that EDA heavily uses the collection of techniques that we call statistical graphics but it is not identical to statistical graphics per se. The term ML model refers to the model artifact that is created by the training process. However I wanted this to be a good introduction to all beginners. Support Vector MachineA Support Vector Machine SVM is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be employed for both classification and regression purposes. Supervised learning is when a model learns from data that is already labeled. For example running this by clicking run or pressing Shift Enter will list the files in the input directory supress warnings Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output. Next I needed to figure out if the supervised problem is a regression task or a classification task. com handle missing data python https www. Sigmoidal https i. EDA is not identical to statistical graphics although the two terms are used almost interchangeably. Equivalent with P B A it is the probability of observing event B given that event A is true. png This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed It is defined by the kaggle python docker image https github.
