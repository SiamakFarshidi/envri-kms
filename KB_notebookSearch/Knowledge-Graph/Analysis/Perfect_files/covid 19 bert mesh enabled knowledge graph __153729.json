What are the infection prevention and control practices measures for preventing or reducing respiratory viruses including coronavirus and influenza in older adults aged 60 years and above living in long term care 2. 5 Today by contrast infectious diseases can traverse the globe in less than a day. To address this issue we generated and characterized a highly reproducible series of phenotypic FSHD like transgenic. Since web access to view the data is restricted to the local site deidentification of geographic indicators is not required. What has been published about ethical and social science considerations 9. Paragraph Number 2 The copyright holder for this preprint which was not peer reviewed is the author funder. As a significant complement to existing research this study employs a tvSVAR model and retrospectively investigates and 13. Future work will involve generation of protein protein interaction maps in different human cell types as well as bat cells and the study of related coronaviruses including SARS CoV MERS CoV and the less virulent OC43 5 data that will allow for valuable cross species and viral evolution studies. Graphs in Figures 7A 7B and 7C depict the propensity for disorder in ORF3a proteins of novel SARS CoV 2 Human SARS CoV and Bat CoV SARS like respectively. Only the best selected epitopes from previous steps the epitopes that followed the selection criteria of high antigenicity non allergenicity and non toxicity in the previous steps were considered best were taken for 3D structure prediction 119 121. Prenatal and postnatal mental health should be prioritised due to its pervasive short and long term impacts on maternal familial and fetus infant and child biopsychosocial development 31. Initial parameter ranges were specified to envelop at least the high and low point estimates used in other modeling studies and to encompass uncertainty ranges from those studies when provided sources in Supplemental Information. In some cases both Knowledge graph as well as BERT were giving the same results which essentially means that the title of the document is representative of the entire document. the distribution of delays between primary and secondary infections 24 and its basic reproduction number R 0 i. The genetic diversity accumulating along transmission chains depends on various genomic and epidemiological factors. The other approach considers outbreak reconstruction from a phylogenetic perspective inferring unobserved historical relationships between pathogen samples to capture more complex evolutionary dynamics. These undetected infections had the potential to spread freely in the population giving raise to the rapid exponential phase of the epidemics before the lockout measures. Paragraph Number 3 Paragraph Number 25 FSHD is caused by mosaic expression of DUX4 fl mRNA and its encoded protein from the normally silent DUX4 gene in a small fraction of differentiated adult skeletal myocytes 8 19. Paragraph Number 3 The 3D structures of the selected epitopes were generated using PEP FOLD3 http bioserv. Bloom JD Gong LI Baltimore D. Query 8 What do we know about diagnostics and surveillance Title Alpha ketoamides as broad spectrum inhibitors of coronavirus and enterovirus replication Structure based design synthesis and activity assessment Entity extraction method Knowledge Graph Paragraph Number 1 A number of capped dipeptidyl a ketoamides have been described as inhibitors of the norovirus 3C like protease. 12 13 To assess the potential decision value of new information we focused on the projected time until the hospital supply constraint was exceeded by COVID 19 demand as a proxy for major decision relevant outcomes. Although the study analysed only a small number of cases nine women with confirmed COVID19 pneumonia under such emergent circum stances these findings are valuable for preventive and clinical practice in China and elsewhere. Please find results for few of the TASK this was just to check effectivity of BERT. Unfortunately our minimal knowledge of the molecular details of SARS CoV 2 infection precludes a comprehensive evaluation of small molecule candidates for host directed therapies. Please find the results below for only BERT Results https imgur. Paragraph Number 3 Sequence analysis of SARS CoV 2 isolates suggests that the 30kb genome encodes as many as 14 open reading frames Orfs. Further some of the more common laboratory findings described in COVID 19 patients include liver function test abnormalities. While governments and international agencies have striven to create incentives to attract additional private sector investment in vaccine development these efforts have so far failed in attracting sufficient capital to enhance preparedness against the world s most deadly emerging pathogens 21. 03 respectively see Table 3. By adopting the dual color strategy of microarray we can measure IgG and IgM simultaneously. Consistent with this prediction participants with higher levels of chronic loneliness during the initial screening reported less craving for social contact after 10 hours of isolation in response to the social cues in the cue induced craving task Social_Craving_CIC r 38 0. This hypothesis is supported by improved MBL binding and in vivo virus clearance of a genetically engineered WNV with additional N67 glycosylation site. The DUAs define for the clinical laboratory how BioFire will manage and make use of the Trend data. In this study we utilized information available on SARS CoV 2 genome and translated proteome from GenBank and carried out a comprehensive computational analysis of the prevalence of the intrinsic disorder in SARS CoV 2 proteins. Clinical compounds ABBV 744 and CPI 0610 act on BRD2 4 with an affinity of 2 nM or 39 nM respectively several preclinical compounds also target bromodomain containing proteins Table 1a b. 11 The reported frequency of diarrhea among COVID 19 patients has varied from 2 to 33 and was one of the prominent symptoms reported by the first case in the United States. As of February 19 there are 75 101 confirmed cases including 2 121 death report in China among which over 80 are from Hubei and over 50 are from Wuhan the capital city of Hubei 12. Surveying these permissive mutations is therefore a useful contributor to studies of disease emergence. Paragraph Number 2. The First two results shown here uses the initial approach we took with 12 documents and the later ones include the results using the latest work with the biorxiv_medrxiv dataset. Moreover as the diversity of known taxa expands and novel species continue to be identified 26 27 probe sets designed by such methods must also be dynamic and scalable to keep pace with these changes. Thus to achieve maximal utility 90 infectious disease surveillance systems should move beyond syndrome based reporting and be pathogen specific and comprehensive reporting on as many of the common pathogens for a particular syndrome as possible. 0 International license It is made available under a author funder who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. Therapies targeting the host virus interface where mutational resistance is arguably less likely could potentially present durable broad spectrum treatment modalities 15. There is concern that imported cases may have gone undetected and contribute unknowingly to the global spread of the disease 11 15. PubMed 20522774 Although there is an understandable focus on the emergence of mutations of phenotypic importance such as those that confer antiviral resistance this paper shows that the evolution of major fitness enhancing mutations may be associated with those that occur elsewhere in the viral genome. Title 2 When are pathogen genome sequences informative of transmission events viruses Extracted Method Knowledge Graph BERT Paragraph Number 1 The impact of limited genetic diversity on the reconstruction of disease outbreaks remains to be investigated. Paragraph Number 3 How are people affected by a period of forced social isolation Chronic social isolation and loneliness are associated with lower physical 1 5 and mental 5 6 7 8 9 health but little is known about the consequences of acute mandatory isolation. The list ot titles of those documents are 1. 10 On 31 December 2019 the World Health Organization WHO China Country Office was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology detected in Wuhan City located in the Hubei Province China associated with exposures in a seafood and wet wholesale market in the same city. The regenerative potential of AT2 cells could be activated for timely recovery from lung epithelial injury2 4 including lobectomy and infections5 6. We have estimated the mean PPIDs of Nsp2s of SARS CoV 2 Human SARS CoV and Bat CoV to be 5. RNA viruses have mutation rates of between 0. Wdfc3 and Trim36 mRNA levels are each significantly increased in muscles from the moderate and severe models compared with the mild model and Trim36 mRNA levels are significantly increased in the severe model compared to the moderate model Figure 3B and C. This method is a quick cheap efficient easy and cost effective way to design vaccine. Second we evaluated the reduction in this uncertainty that would result from obtaining more precise information about 1 the effectiveness of NPIs or 2 the fraction of all cases ascertained. 1 In tandem transportation networks have expanded and evolved to satisfy the growing social and economic demands for global connectivity. MSA of SARS CoV 2 Human SARS and Bat CoV Nsp3 proteins. To quantify this diversity we introduce the concept of transmission divergence which we define as the number of mutations accumulating between pathogen WGS sampled from transmission pairs. Paragraph Number 3 Consider a large set of input sequences that encompass a diverse set of taxa e. BERT Training and Document Extraction 1. 20046904 doi medRxiv preprint important feature of travel trends connectivity between countries with differential capacities to detect and respond to infectious disease threats. Due to computational limitations we have trained the model on a subset of the entire dataset. The clinical characteristics reported in pregnant women with confirmed COVID19 infection are similar to those reported for nonpregnant adults with confirmed COVID19 infection in the general population and are indicative of a relatively optimistic clinical course and outcomes for COVID19 infection compared with SARSCoV1 infection. We assumed that average duration of hospitalization for COVID 19 was 10 days. Given a natural language query return relevant paragraphs having related key phrases to the query. Thus we were able to retrieve that document from our search model. Paragraph Number 2 Coronaviruses are single stranded enveloped and positive sense RNA viruses which are spherical in shape and have petal like spines 1. Further the pre defined function of entity extraction from spacy is used and the union of these two are used along with DBpedia and Scispacy Model Has_body Key phrases are extracted using topic rank algorithm. Individual differences in social network size did not predict either self reported or neural responses to acute social isolation all p values 0. Query 1 What do we know about COVID 19 risk factors Title 1 What Should Gastroenterologists and Patients Know About COVID 19 Extracted Method Knowledge Graph Bert Paragraph Number 1 COVID 19 is a respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus that was first identified in Wuhan the capital city of China s Hubei Province in December 2019. This raises the question how are we safeguarding the short and longer term mental health of pregnant women and their partners in the age of coronavirus Apart from the overall population level pandemic related stress there is still a limited formal evidence base about the nature and clinical consequences of the various versions of coronavirus COVID 19 or SARS CoV 2 or HCoV 19 for a pregnant woman. 2 homology to bat coronavirus. While our study was underway Zeng et al. We believe there is great potential in systematically exploring the host dependencies of the SARS CoV 2 virus to identify other host proteins already targeted with existing drugs. Although the number of registered MERS cases is low 2494 as of November 30 2019 www. This is clearly different from the pattern of hospitalisation that occurred in China where hospitalisation was also used to ensure case isolation. In Japan and Hong Kong hospital supplies are running low but have not yet impacted clinical management. Paragraph Number 2 To truly elucidate the role of bats as reservoirs for arboviruses field surveillance studies documenting natural infection and transmission dynamics among vector and vertebrate species must be supplemented with experimental infections to characterize viremia profiles and infectiousness to vectors virus induced pathology and immune kinetics following infection. If this is unlikely and we are in a situation where interventions cannot be sustained long enough to prevent a resurgent epidemic some interventions should be relaxed. 7 Risk factors for more severe illness requiring hospitalization appear to be older age and having underlying chronic medical conditions such as diabetes lung disease and cardiovascular disease. 6 8 The reported fatality rate for hospitalized COVID 19 patients has ranged from 1. Increased travel between two countries with strong health care and public health systems will likely have very different implications for global health security than increased travel between countries with less developed infrastructure or countries with disparities in their capacities to respond to public health threats. 0 mutations per genome replication several logs higher than those of double strand DNA viruses and which will generate abundant genetic variation when coupled with huge population sizes 17. However it can be difficult to compare a disparate set of estimates of R 0 from different research groups as well as the associated degrees of uncertainty when the estimation methods and their underlying assumptions vary widely. What do we know about virus genetics origin and evolution 4. Twenty four h post transfection cells 445 Paragraph Number 2 profile of S129A suggests that this mutation introduces some local conformational change 424 Paragraph Number 3 We further investigated the effect of S129A on VP35 oligomerization domain conformation by 431 computational modeling. Patients with potential symptoms of COVID 19 with recent travel to areas of higher incidence China South Korea Japan Iran and Italy based on the most recent CDC data should be asked to wear a standard surgical mask as soon as they are identified and be placed in a private room with the door closed ideally an airborne isolation room negative pressure room. MSA of SARS CoV 2 Human SARS and Bat CoV Nsp4 proteins. 2 MERS is characterized by severe respiratory disease quite similar to SARS but in addition frequently causes renal failure 3. However they differ in their complement of 3 open reading frames SARS CoV 2 possesses an Orf3b and Orf10 with limited detectable protein homology to SARS CoV 16 and its Orf8 is intact while SARS CoV encodes Orf8a and Orf8b Fig. Interestingly they also reported that a six membered d lactam in the P1 position led to 2 3 times higher activities compared to the fivemembered g lactam. The Covid 19 outbreak first triggered public panic and mental health distress in China 2. Paragraph Number 3 Plau gene regulates polarization and bioelectric features of AT2 monolayers. The graph enabled search helps the user search based on very specific medical terminology. Any concern for possible COVID 19 should immediately prompt notification of institutional infection prevention and control as well as local or state health departments. Only China so far registered a widespread epidemic 2 and authorities have implemented massive intervention measures to curtail it 3. These entities are then used to make triples for knowledge graph creation. Notably as capture requires additional cycles of amplification computational analyses should properly account for duplicate reads due to amplification the inclusion of unique molecular identifiers 54 55 could improve determination of unique fragments. Paragraph Number 3 As the COVID19 outbreak unfolds prevention and control of COVID19 infection among pregnant women and the potential risk of vertical transmission have become a major concern. In all this experiment demonstrates that acute objective social isolation can induce subjective social craving in human participants. Paragraph Number 3 Fifth in all locations critical care treatment and medicines have been available for patients with COVID 19 but adequate supplies of personal protective equipment in hospitals and face masks in the community are a key concern. Paragraph Number 3 Calorimetric measurements suggest that the formation of FtsZ assemblies requires the crossing of a critical concentration threshold Caplan and Erickson 2003 Chen et al. Query 5 What has been published about medical care Title Guidelines for preventing respiratory illness in older adults aged 60 years and above living in long term care A rapid review of clinical practice guidelines Extraction method Knowledge graph Paragraph Number 1 Standard precautions refer to the work practices required to achieve a basic level of infection prevention and control. Title Title A SARS CoV 2 Human Protein Protein Interaction Map Reveals Drug Targets and Potential Drug Repurposing Abbreviations HC PPIs High confidence protein protein interactions PPIs protein protein interaction AP MS affinity purification mass spectrometry Entity extraction method Knowledge Graph Paragraph Number 1 Mycophenolic acid Sanglifehrin A Paragraph Number 2 Systematic validation using genetic based approaches 79 80 will be key to determine the functional relevance of these interactions and if the human proteins are being used by the virus or are fighting off infection information that would inform future pharmacological studies. When we started our survey on March 28 2020 Iran had one of the highest national counts of Covid 19 confirmed cases 35 408 and deaths 2717 and a mortality rate of 7. Over the last two decades there have been three major epidemics due to human transmissible viruses namely Avian Ebola and Sars but fortunately the advanced ability of the scientific world has been able to contain their effects. Estimates of the basic reproductive number are of interest during an outbreak because they provide information about the level of intervention required to interrupt transmission Anderson and May 1991 and about the potential final size of the outbreak Anderson and May 1991 Ma and Earn 2006. Paragraph Number 2 The copyright holder for this preprint. It is important that more common respiratory illnesses influenza etc. This is related to the high casefatality rate about 35 compared to 10 for SARS and to the fact that MERS cases are still accumulating seven years after the discovery of the virus whereas the SARS outbreak was essentially contained within 6 months. Therefore periodically checking on recommendations from leading national and international health organizations such as the CDC or the World Health Organization WHO is the most important way for both patients and physicians to stay informed with accurate information. To replace aged AT1 cells AT2 cells undergo self renewal to maintain alveolar epithelial homeostasis1. The aim of this paper is to perform a bibliometric analysis on the first papers published in the early stages of the SARS CoV 2 outbreak in order to give a glimpse to the researchers of who published what at the very beginning of this Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Given their RNA they are susceptible to frequent recombination and mutations of their genomes. 41 These were optimized with respect to their P1 substituent whereas P2 was isobutyl in most cases and occasionally benzyl. CD44 AT2 cells show a higher proliferative capacity in fibrotic lungs23. However some women and their partners can experience a range of negative emotions during this period including anxiety and depression. Reverse vaccinology approach of vaccine development also allows the scientists to easily understand the antigenic segments of a virus or pathogen that should be given more emphasis during the vaccine development. the number of tests divided by the number of positive case. These authors mainly studied the structure activity relationships of the P1 residue and found small alkyl substituents to be superior to larger ones. Title When will the Covid 19 epidemic fade out Extraction method BERT Paragraph Number 1 Humanity has always been afflicted by the onset of epidemics. 6 7 8 With improvements in the availability of and access to various modes of transportation over the past several decades and the resultant decreases in time required to reach destinations an outbreak in an isolated location can pose an international threat. This protein functions by disrupting the host survival pathway via interaction with the host proteins Prohibitin 1 and Prohibitin 2 128. Extrapolating to infinite number of tests I estimate a lethality rate of 0. Inverting the relationship between apparent death rate and number of tests it is possible to estimate that in all countries except South Korea and perhaps Germany at least at the beginning of the spread the vast majority of positive cases went undetected with more than 90 percent undetected cases in some countries such as Italy. Analyses were conducted using either inbound or outbound passenger numbers but are presented for outbound passenger numbers only as the inbound and outbound passenger volumes did not differ significantly paired T test p 0. tritaenhiorhynchus the only blood fed mosquitoes collected from the cave were Cx. Title Global profiling of SARS CoV 2 specific IgG IgM responses of convalescents using a proteome microarray Entity extraction method Knowledge Graph Paragraph Number 1 The SARS CoV 2 proteome microarray enables not only the global profiling of virus specific antibody responses but also providing semi quantitative information. This makes our model more medical domain specific. Pearson correlation coefficients between two repeats were 0. fuscopennata Theobald YFV Sindbis chikungunya viruses Culex Cx. Paragraph Number 3 The Infection Prevention Control of the World Health Organization WHO Health Emergency Programme presented a query on preventing and managing COVID 19 in older adults aged 60 years and above living in long term care facilities including privately paid for and publicly paid for settings with a 5 business day timeline. The virus particle is about 50 nm in size and the RNA genome 10. Paragraph Number 3 Finally more attention should be devoted to revealing the common evolutionary and epidemiological patterns exhibited by those viruses that have successfully jumped species boundaries. Specifically it should be possible to compile a cross virus data base of the parameters that correlate most with successful emergence such as how rapidly each virus evolves its mode of transmission its major host or vector species its cell receptors of choice key aspects of phenotype such as virulence and antigenicity its population growth rate its phylogeography and whether it has jumped species boundaries in the past. Paragraph Number 3 Supplementary Figures S1. We sought to address this knowledge gap by systematically mapping the interaction landscape between SARS CoV 2 proteins and human proteins. These methods should be applicable to any taxa including all microbes. Among these the most common among people is when will the epidemic die down During spreading this is a difficult question to answer in addition to understand the early transmission dynamics of the infection control measures should also be accounted for which may significantly affect the trend of infection. These viruses also have several moderately disordered proteins such as Nsp8 Orf6 and Orf9b. However these data are not easily accessible for all countries. Of course it is worth emphasizing that there is still large uncertainty about the combined impact of our available interventions on the spread of COVID 19. The average temperature at the ADM1 centroid was calculated by taking the average of the maximum and minimum temperatures over the observation period at the centroid coordinates using packages ncdf4 9 and rgdal 10. Can Bats Serve as Reservoirs for Arboviruses 6. Reverse vaccinology has successfully been used for developing vaccines to fight against many viruses i. The Trend client software residing on the FilmArray computer queries the FilmArray test result local database and exports the results to an Amazon Web Services AWS database see Methods. However the epidemiological significance of these observations is unclear as to whether or not bats are contributing to the circulation of arboviruses. Although the low price of vaccines is meant to benefit individuals and regions with lower incomes in the long run it has had the opposite effect causing them to be medically underserved due to a lack of vaccine investment. The line list included data on confirmed cases up to February 29 th 2020 for all countries including China. fr services PEP FOLD3 online tool. The approved drug Valproic acid an anticonvulsant and the pre clinical candidate Apicidin inhibit HDAC2 with affinities of 62 \u03bcM and 120 nM respectively. But because of the power of MeSH ontology we figured out that this protein was related to culex entity in one of the documents. COVID 19 has now been reported throughout the world with more reported cases on a daily basis. 1 Containment strategies seem to have prevented smaller transmission chains from amplifying into widespread community transmission. and particularly a host dependent effect. Importantly for future analyses we have shown sex specific differences anatomical muscle specific differences and model specific differences that must be taken into account when using these FSHD like mice. For viral cysteine proteases a ketoamides have only occasionally been described as inhibitors and few systematic studies have been carried out. We have just shown a sample output below for one of the search queries. Multiple sequence alignment of structural proteins of all three studied coronaviruses are generated using Clustal Omega. In reverse vaccinology the tools of bioinformatics are used for identifying and analyzing these novel antigens. This corresponds to the first level administrative unit within each country usually described as a state or province. The National Health Commission of China has published a series of guidelines on the prevention diagnosis and treatment of COVID19 pneumonia based on growing evidence of the pathogens responsible for COVID19 infection as well as the epidemiological characteristics clinical features and the most effective treatments. Mutations can be fixed in populations by genetic drift or natural selection. Similarly ORF3a of Human SARS and Bat CoV also shows MoRFs at N and C terminus with the help of MoRFchibi_web and MoRFPred Supplementary Tables 7 and 8. The 5 Orf1a Orf1ab encodes polyproteins which are auto proteolytically processed into 16 non structural proteins Nsp1 16 which form the replicase transcriptase complex RTC. These include good hand hygiene with alcohol based hand sanitizers or soap and water covering your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve not your hands when coughing or sneezing limiting touching your face avoiding close contact with anyone with influenza like and or upper respiratory symptoms and staying home if you are sick. 7 kb is encapsulated by a protein shell which consists of three structural proteins namely capsid C envelope E and pre membrane protein prM M Kuhn et al. These entities are then also included in the triples with their corresponding relationships. We developed a statistical model to nowcast trends in importations and quantify the proportion of undetected imported cases. Has_abstract The nouns and pronouns are extracted from the abstract. Bafilomycin s inhibition of this cotransporter acts to prevent the acidification of the lysosome inhibiting autophagy and endosome trafficking pathways which may impact the viral life cycle. Clinical trials on several vaccine candidates are also underway 13 as well as trials of repurposed host directed compounds inhibiting the human protease TMPRSS2 14. As discussed in the study pregnant women are susceptible to respiratory pathogens and to development of severe pneumonia which possibly makes them more susceptible to COVID19 infection than the general population especially if they have chronic diseases or maternal complications. No infectious virus was isolated and viral loads were considered too low for the bats to function as amplifying hosts. Studies have shown that de identification of patient data is not as simple as removing all specific identifiers because in the age of big data under the right 110 circumstances it is possible to re associate patients and their data using publicly available information 45 46 47 48. The rates are adjusted for under ascertainment and corrected for demography. 43 described a series of five a ketoamides with P1 cyclopropyl that showed submicromolar activity against EV D68 and two HRV strains. 2012 collected mosquitoes from five genera inside a bat cave in Thailand to investigate sylvatic circulation of JBEV. 20043315 doi medRxiv preprint author funder who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. Pharmaceutical companies and investors are directing their resources to projects in which the estimated return on investment is more predictable and lucrative. Title 3 Dengue Virus Glycosylation What Do We Know Extracted Method Knowledge Graph Paragraph Number 1 Mannose binding lectin MBL in the lectin pathway triggers antibody independent activation of complement Thielens et al. Accordingly we quantified the sequence complexities of each of the designed CTTs based on the WT and reduced amino acid alphabets. 11 12 SARS CoV 2 has been detected in the stool of COVID 19 patients. From the previous step top 3 documents titles are also taken from the BERT training having cosine similarity score greater than 90 for that particular query. Title Defining high value information for COVID 19 decision making COVID 19 Statistics Policy modeling and Epidemiology Collective C SPEC 1 Entity extraction method BERT Paragraph Number 1 In this study we demonstrate a model based approach to determining priorities for acquiring new information based on the potential value of this information in reducing critical uncertainties relevant to COVID 19 decision making over short and medium term. Paragraph Number 3 What is currently known about COVID 19 15. 3 Social media and virtual feedback We enlist community participation feedback modeling contributions software contributions and data contributions through social media virtual seminars web based forms and a dedicated Slack workspace. 12 This novel coronavirus suddenly turned out to be a global health concern for a disease called Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID 19 13 which was characterized as a pandemic by WHO on 11 March 2020. Additionally a comparison was also made with proteins from close relatives of SARS CoV 2 from the same group of beta coronaviruses Human SARS CoV and Bat CoV. SEIR family models are effective in exploring the epidemic characteristics of the outbreak forecasting the inflection point and ending time and deciding the measures to curb the spreading. Firstly discovered and identified in 1965 2 coronaviruses have not caused large scale outbreaks until the 2003 SARS epidemic in China followed by 2012 MERS in Saudi Arabia and 2015 MERS in South Korea 3. With bats these tasks are not trivial and carry significant challenges in both the field and the lab. 990598 doi bioRxiv preprint On performing MSA results of which are shown in Figure 7D we found that ORF3a protein from SARS COV 2 is slightly evolutionary closer to the ORF3a of Bat CoV 73. Since the Fc tag could be recognized by fluorescence labeled anti human IgG antibody the ACE2 Fc generated high signals for all the tests which could serve as control for the anti human IgG antibody though the initial reason to include ACE2 on the microarray is for applications other than serum profiling. How do infection prevention and control practices differ for adults aged 60 years and above living in long term care with respiratory illness from low and middle income economy countries LMIC differ than those living in high income economy countries and do differences exist across different cultural contexts Paragraph Number 2 The rapid review conduct was guided by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions 1 along with the Rapid Review Guide for Health Policy and Systems Research 2. Methodology 1 a. However preclinical testing for different candidate FSHD therapeutics targeting DUX4 fl mRNA and protein expression in these mice will likely require different criteria such as degree and progression of pathophysiology dependent upon the approach. The Trend client software performs de identification on the FilmArray computer prior to export as detailed in 170 Table 2. Paragraph Number 2 Seventeen years have passed since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS in 2003 but there is yet no approved treatment for infections with the SARS coronavirus SARS CoV. This is done to increase the reach and power of our knowledge graph such that it covers not only the terms present in the documents but also related entities which are not present but can be helpful. This quantity changes rapidly and systematically both in time and in space generating doubts and concerns regarding its interpretation. The former displayed IC50 values one order of magnitude lower than the latter indicating that the S2 pocket of the norovirus 3CL protease is fairly small. We explored whether pre existing loneliness was also associated with different responses to food cues after fasting and find that while loneliness did not affect self reported food craving p values p 0. First we calculated the uncertainty around this projected time when the model was only calibrated to the confirmed case counts through March 15. Paragraph Number 2 Understanding transmission dynamics in the early stages of an infectious disease outbreak is essential for informing effective control policy. 2 It was identified by researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology through metagenomic analysis of a bronchoalveolar lavage sample from a patient in the initial cluster of pneumonia cases in that city. These include four structural proteins Spike S Envelope E Membrane M and Nucleocapsid N 17 and nine putative accessory factors Fig. 1 All 31 provinces in mainland China have now adopted the firstlevel response to major public health emergencies. Paragraph Number 3 In sum this paper provides the first empirical evidence of the level of distress of Iranian adults during the Covid 19 pandemic. Further the vertebrate reservoir must also develop viremia sufficient to allow the hematophagous arthropod to acquire an infectious bloodmeal 10 in order for vector borne transmission to occur. What are the risks of COVID 19 infection in pregnant women 2. Examples of long term care include nursing homes charitable homes municipal homes long term care hospitals long term care facilities skilled nursing facilities convalescent homes and assisted living facilities https www. Mitigation should then focus on allowing controlled spread toward herd immunity in such a way that the most vulnerable populations are protected most and the health care system remains functional. The significance of the relative pathogenicity of the infectious agent to the purported reservoir host has been debated 5. At the 3 end of the viral genome as many as 13 Orfs are expressed from nine predicted sub genomic RNAs. Migration and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells MSCs in inflamed tissues are regulated by dynamic fibrinolytic niche9 12. 020 two tailed and somewhat less craving on the online questionnaire Social_Craving_Q r 38 0. The results suggest adults in Iran are experiencing more distress than adults in China with level of distress predicted by different factors suggesting future research needs to examine mental health and the predictors in individual countries to effectively identify and screen those who are more susceptible to mental health issues during the Covid 19 pandemic. What is the time scale of hantavirus evolution 10. For the convalescent COVID 19 patients tested in this study that with a median of 22 days after onset we found that the overall IgG response is significantly higher than that of IgM indicating for these patients the SARS CoV 2 specific IgG responses are dominant at the convalescent phase although IgM level might reach the peak at a similar time point with that of IgG according to some studies of SARS Paragraph Number 2 The detailed layout of the SARS CoV 2 proteome microarray was indicated as well Fig. This extrapolation of the data shows that when the time course of the disease is controlled for the lethality estimated for all countries for which reliable data are available depends only on the intensity of the performed tests i. Paragraph Number 3 This crisis driven expanded interest in vaccines to address epidemic threats is encouraging but there is still much work to be done. Query 9 What has been published about information sharing and inter sectoral collaboration Title Evolved sequence features within the intrinsically disordered tail influence FtsZ assembly and bacterial cell division Entity extraction method Knowledge Graph Paragraph Number 1 Previous studies showed that deletion of the CTL leads to aberrant FtsZ assembly that compromises Z ring formation and cell division Buske and Levin 2013. As listed in Table 2 and Supplementary Tables 7 and 8 Human SARS CoV does not contain MoRF while SARS CoV 2 and Bat CoV have an N terminally located MoRF region predicted by MoRFchibi_web. However increased travel volume alone does not capture another. Also quantifying the sensitivity and specificity of capture with comprehensive probe sets is challenging as it is for metagenomic sequencing more broadly because doing so would necessitate obtaining viral genomes for the hundreds of targeted species and false positives are likely to be due to components of sequencing and classification that are unrelated to capture e. ORF3a of SARS CoV 2 shows protein binding regions at its N terminus by MoRFchibi_web residues 1 6 MoRFPred residues 7 12 and DISOPRED3 residues 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 and at C terminus by MoRFchibi_web residues 261 268 and MoRFPred residues 259 263 Table 2. 20033357 doi medRxiv preprint estimates of the probability of requiring hospitalisation assume that only severe cases clinically require hospitalisation. There is even less information about the mental health impacts consequent to self isolation living in a household with an affected person limited access to goods services and to routine or emergency health and social care. 5 SARS CoV was the causal agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreaks in 2002 and 2003 in Guangdong Province China 7 8 9 MERS CoV was the pathogen responsible for severe respiratory disease outbreaks in 2012 in the Middle East. What is known about transmission incubation and environmental stability 2. However the figures reported by BBC Persian for Iran were much higher. WGS data is used to reconstruct phylogenetic trees which are either treated as data upon which transmission histories are overlaid 10 11 12 or jointly inferred alongside the transmission tree itself 13 14 15. Paragraph Number 2 A dangerous impact of infectious diseases on populations can arise from emergence and spread of novel pathogens in a population or a sudden change in the epidemiology of an existing pathogen. Paragraph Number 2 Despite the potential of capture there are challenges and practical considerations that are present with the use of any probe set. All the entities which are extracted are further filtered using top common words corpus to remove the frequently occurring words and keep only rare words. What should we tell our patients based on our current knowledge First this is a rapidly evolving area with new information emerging on a daily basis. Paragraph Number 2 is the which was not peer reviewed The copyright holder for this preprint. While these collections included arbovirus vectors Cx. What do we know about diagnostics and surveillance 8. urine feces saliva 2 3 4. Valuable insights can be gained by the reconstruction of the transmission tree which describes the history of infectious events at the resolution of individual cases 1 2 3 4. We additionally took two more questions and tried extracting results only for BERT that is explained in Section 2 BERT Training and Document Extraction In the first step to extract the documents we ran BERT embeddings on all the 45k titles. Further the detection of viral nucleic acid in free ranging bats does not necessarily implicate the species as an arboviral reservoir. Second it is important to realize that the majority of cases 80 have been mild the fatality rate for COVID 19 is lower than prior coronavirus outbreaks and the proportion of severe fatal cases may be an overestimate as milder or asymptomatic cases are likely under reported. 2020 Liu et al. In the case of bats as a reservoir species rigorous field and experimental evidence now exist to solidify the role of the Egyptian rousette bat Rousettus aegyptiacus as the reservoir for Marburg virus 6 7 8. A separate study instead reported preferential binding of recombinant human MBL to insect cell derived DENV2 whereas virions produced in monocyte derived DC were not neutralized by human MBL. This study provides new evidence for the possible prognostic relevance of the fibrinolytic niche for ARDS patients. Despite the fact that isolation lasted only ten hours and the participants knew exactly when it would end participants reported more loneliness and social craving at the end of the day than they did at the beginning. Testing has been performed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC but is now more widely available in state and city laboratories and is becoming available commercially. Paragraph Number 2 The effectiveness of such measures however critically depends on COVID 19 epidemiology and natural history 8 9 as well as the volume of importations 6. According to the WHO long term care covers those activities undertaken by others to ensure that people with or at risk of a significant ongoing loss of intrinsic capacity can maintain a level of functional ability consistent with their basic rights fundamental freedoms and human dignity https www. Result Extraction using BERT and Knowledge Graph 1. Paragraph Number 3 This rapid prototyping effort brings together specialists from a broad variety of domains virology and infectious diseases mathematical biology computer science high performance computing data science and other disciplines. Here we synthesize what information is currently known regarding the exposure history and permissiveness of bats to arbovirus infections and identify knowledge gaps regarding their designation as arbovirus reservoirs. org accessed March 4 th 2020.

Therapeutic intervention against alphacoronaviruses is indicated in cases of accompanying disease such as cystic fibrosis 11 or leukemia 12 or certain other underlying medical conditions. 11 Interestingly the cell entry receptor ACE2 appears to mediate entry of SARS CoV 2 similar to SARS and has been demonstrated to be highly expressed in small intestinal enterocytes. MSA of SARS CoV 2 Human SARS and Bat CoV Nucleoproteins. We have not used the entire dataset of 45 000 titles in our experiment due to computational limitations. This generate the list of titles which are similar to the input query. Title 2 What are the risks of COVID 19 infection in pregnant women Extracted Method BERT Paragraph Number 1 Stephanie colleagues did not find any evidence of the presence of SARSCoV2 viral particles in the products of conception or in neonates in accordance with the findings of a previous study on SARSCoV1 done by Wong and colleagues. Medical records and devices have become attractive targets for cyber attackers in recent years 44 which has made hospitals and clinics reluctant to connect their Local Area Networks LANs to the Internet. Furthermore it can force probes to be designed with relaxed assumptions about hybridization across all taxa. These documents were fetched based on BERT results for the first two tasks on the entire datset. As the fourth large scale outbreak of coronaviruses 2019 nCoV is spreading quickly to all provinces in China and has recently become a world wide epidemic. 2 \u00b5M probably because P2 was isobutyl. Similarly the Sigma2 receptor interacted with the vial protein orf9. 5 Integration of feedback All community feedback is evaluated to plan the next set of model refinements and recorded in an updated bioRxiv preprint. 0 International license is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint which was not peer reviewed is the author funder. High Level Flow Diagram https imgur. Paragraph Number 3 In spite of the considerable threat posed by SARS CoV and related viruses as well as by MERS CoV it is obvious that the number of cases so far does not warrant the commercial development of an antiviral drug targeting MERS and SARS CoV even if a projected steady growth of the number of MERS cases is taken into account. Title Preliminary evidence that higher temperatures are associated with lower incidence of COVID 19 for cases reported globally up to 29th February 2020 Entity extraction method BERT Paragraph Number 1 Daily gridded temperature data at 0. MSA of SARS CoV 2 Human SARS and Bat CoV Nsp2 proteins. Here we pursue answers to some of these questions by leveraging insights that have emerged through systematic studies of sequence encoded conformational preferences of intrinsically disordered proteins regions Das et al. Paragraph Number 2 The first challenge for this research was to induce a subjective state of social craving using an experimentally induced period of objective isolation. In contrast both DUX4 FL target genes assayed showed significant induction in all bitransgenic animals compared with the FLExD mice indicating the presence of DUX4 FL protein. It is important to note that pharmacological intervention with the agents we identified in this study could be either detrimental or beneficial for infection. 13 The enteroviruses include pathogens such as EV D68 the causative agent of the 2014 outbreak of the summer flu in the US 14 EV A71 and Coxsackievirus A16 CVA16 the etiological agents of Hand Foot and Mouth Disease HFMD 15 Coxsackievirus B3 CVB3 which can cause myocardic inflammation 16 and human rhinoviruses HRV notoriously known to lead to the common cold but also capable of causing exacerbations of asthma and COPD. Cases were aggregated to the first level administrative division ADM1 in which they occurred as defined by the Global Administrative Areas dataset https gadm. quinquefasciatus at least 20 of which had fed on Leschnault s rousette Rousettus leschenaulti bats 176. For example a comprehensive survey of the phylodynamic patterns 56 exhibited by currently circulating viruses will do much to help us understand how a new virus will evolve and spread once it has emerged. 012 which is very noisy but consistent with the estimate of 0. Intuitively greater transmission divergence should enable better reconstruction of these transmission trees although the nature of this relationship remains to be described. Title A SARS CoV 2 Human Protein Protein Interaction Map Reveals Drug Targets and Potential Drug Repurposing Abbreviations HC PPIs High confidence protein protein interactions PPIs protein protein interaction AP MS affinity purification mass spectrometry Entity extraction method Knowledge Graph Paragraph Number 1 Mycophenolic acid Sanglifehrin A Paragraph Number 2 There are several mechanistically interesting and potentially disease relevant drug target interactions revealed in the chemoinformatic network Fig. For example uPA and plasmin two critical components of the fibrinolytic niche cleave epithelial sodium channels ENaC 18 19. It therefore remains unclear whether MBL mediated virus clearance is optimally engaged during DENV infection in humans. The reported coordinates of the case variably a point location city centroid or different subnational administrative levels were used to determine the ADM1 in which the case occurred. In addition functionally multifaceted uPA regulates alveolar epithelial function20 and possesses an A6 motif with a high affinity to CD44 receptors21 22. 7 8 9 More recent descriptions of patients in China also noted around 10 of patients were also noted to have elevated total bilirubin levels. Title Reconciling early outbreak estimates of the basic reproductive number and its uncertainty framework and applications to the novel coronavirus SARS CoV 2 outbreak Extraction method BERT Paragraph Number 1 Since December 2019 a novel coronavirus SARS CoV 2 has been spreading in China and other parts of the world World Health Organization 2020d. Sensitive and specific automated molecular diagnostic systems that detect up to four different pathogens in a single sample have been available from in vitro diagnostic IVD manufacturers for some time 31 32 33. In this section we outline key aspects of viral replication and host response in functional terms needed for development of agent based multi scale and multi physics models. funereus mosquitoes vector of RRV had fed on Pteropus alecto bats 149. Paragraph Number 2 Chen 2005 27 Taiwan SARS Wards or emergency units Nurses N 128 Depression SCR anxiety SCR PTSD IES intrusion and avoidance IES somatization interpersonal sensitivity hostility psychoticism SCR Paragraph Number 3 In this timely systematic rapid review we synthesized evidence from 61 studies examining the impact on mental health of providing frontline healthcare during infectious disease outbreaks. The Impact of Host Based Early Warning on Disease Outbreaks. Are there geographic variations in the mortality rate of COVID 19 The first two results use the initial approach we took with 12 documents and the later ones include the results using the latest work with the biorxiv_medrxiv dataset. The latest research by Huijun Chen and colleagues 5 reported in The Lancet provides some insight into the clinical characteristics pregnancy outcomes and vertical transmission potential of COVID19 infection in pregnant women. Although we did not include the norovirus 3CL pro in our study expanding the target range of our inhibitors to norovirus is probably a realistic undertaking. We analyzed importations that were successfully isolated and those leading to onward transmission characterizing their case timeline. In February 2020 several reports were published in The Lancet stating that mental health care should be included in the national public health emergency systems and that further understanding was needed to better respond to future unexpected disease outbreaks 26 27 28 29 30. 8 28 318 in organs tested by RT PCR 65. Given the unprecedented level of detail of WGS data and the epidemiological insights it has provided in real life scenarios 21 23 genetic analysis is clearly an indispensable tool for outbreak reconstruction. 6 billion people and is expected to reach 9. As of February 27 2020 the World Health Organization WHO has confirmed 82 294 cases of the coronavirus disease including 3 664 confirmed cases in 46 different countries outside China World Health Organization 2020a. Outside China affected countries are facing importations of cases and clusters of local transmission 1 4 5 Border controls have been reinforced in many countries and active surveillance has been intensified to rapidly detect and isolate importations trace contacts and isolate suspect cases 6 7. Several existing approaches to probe design for non microbial targets 28 29 30 strive to meet some of these goals but are not designed to be applied against the extensive diversity seen within and across microbial taxa. The proposed MBL mediated virus elimination mechanisms include 1 direct virus neutralization 2 C3 C4 deposition on virus surface and 3 interference of host cell lectin receptor binding. Title The Essential Facts of Wuhan Novel Coronavirus Outbreak in China and Epitope based Vaccine Designing against COVID 19 Extraction method Knowledge Graph Paragraph Number 1 Reverse vaccinology refers to the process of developing vaccines where the novel antigens of a virus or microorganism or organism are detected by analyzing the genomic and genetic information of that particular virus or organism. 3 7 It is important to note that travel history criteria for testing for COVID 19 will change as community based spread is emerging within the United States and patients living in or with recent travel to areas where COVID 19 has been confirmed should be considered for testing as well. Paragraph Number 2 The most prominent a ketoamide drugs are probably telaprivir and boceprivir peptidomimetic inhibitors of the HCV NS3 4A protease 39 40 which have helped revolutionize the treatment of chronic HCV infections. What do we know about COVID 19 risk factors 3. In addition to leukopenia reported in 9 25 of cases or leukocytosis 24 30 elevated alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase have been seen in up to 37 of cases. neavei Theobald WNV Babanki Spondweni Sindbis Koutango viruses and Cx. Although natural selection is a deterministic process which ought to engender it with some inherent predictability this will only be possible if the fitness of each relevant mutation is known in each relevant environment. MSA of SARS CoV 2 Human SARS and Bat CoV Nsp16 proteins. Releasing patient test results requires the removal of PHI or authorization from the patient. Hence using a combination of both BERT and Knowledge Graph covers the aspects of semantic search as well as some keyword specific search. However the amiloride affinity was not altered significantly Fig. Today due to the absence of a vaccine and to a highly globalized society the Covid 19 epidemic is frightening the world raising a series of important questions. Prevention and preparedness Facilities must ensure they are prepared for respiratory outbreaks prior to the start of the influenza season March April. 4 5 6 In the past years two other strains of Coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus MERS CoV have emerged as potential public health worldwide threats. 15 Third there are currently no specific recommendations for people on immunosuppression such as IBD patients.

We therefore aim to provide a brief overview of COVID 19 for the gastroenterology community based on currently available information to help assist with addressing our patients questions and concerns Paragraph Number 3 Measures to control the spread of COVID 19 are similar to the general advice for preventing any respiratory viral illness. Similarly for molecular diagnostics of particular pathogens many commonly used assays such as qRT PCR and rapid antigen tests are likely to be faster and less expensive than metagenomic sequencing. Interestingly there were no significant changes detected in DUX4 fl mRNA levels between the mild moderate and severe models 9 days after TMX treatments a timepoint with prominent differences in DUX4 FL protein expression Figure 2. The divergent bioelectric features in polarized AT2 monolayers including transepithelial resistance RT and short circuit currents ISC were measured. In the media but also in some non specialist scientific circles it is frequent to find that lethality is estimated as the cumulative number of deaths divided by the cumulative number of confirmed cases data that are easily accessible to everyone in the internet. 1 One of the reasons is that despite the devastating consequences of SARS for the affected patients the development of an antiviral drug against this virus would not be commercially viable in view of the fact that the virus has been rapidly contained and did not reappear since 2004. MBL is reactive to high mannose oligosaccharides and thus can efficiently recognize insect cell derived DENV with high mannose glycans present on its E proteins. This indicates the dispensable nature of the Nsp2 protein for SARS viruses 129. What has been published about information sharing and inter sectoral collaboration 10. This paradigm could be useful for future research investigating for example how. While field evidence supports the exposure of bats to DENV in multiple geographic areas experimental infections conducted to date are consistent in that bats are not likely to support DENV replication and circulation to levels high enough to infect blood feeding mosquitoes. We will supply this model to the community for use in parallel studies by multiple labs. What do we know about vaccines and therapeutics 5. When are pathogen genome sequences informative of transmission events 8. Does reduced MHC diversity decrease viability of vertebrate populations After this as a second step we trained our model on 1000 documents from the biorxiv_medrxiv dataset. 4 The intermediate animal vector between bats and humans for SARS CoV 2 is currently unknown but has been linked epidemiologically to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. Anti DENV antibodies have been detected in multiple bat species in Uganda 29. Among the emerging large volume of studies the classical susceptible exposed infectious recovered SEIR model wth its various extensions is the most popular method 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38. The key phrases of the input query and the titles of the documents are matched against the corresponding paragraphs from the documents using fuzzy logic to get the paragraphs which is relevant to the search query. For women and especially for those living in poverty in poor or cramped housing these issues may be exacerbated if they are expected to be the main carers for elderly or infirm relatives or for young children while living with multiple family members in confined spaces. Starting from the available WT crystal structure a Ser to Ala 432 substitution was made and the oligomerization domain was subjected to energy minimization. It also raised several questions regarding the contribution of the intrinsically disordered CTL to the assortment of functions coordinated by FtsZ. 4 SARS like coronaviruses are still circulating in bats in China 5 6 7 8 from where they may spill over into the human population this is probably what caused the current outbreak of atypical pneumonia in Wuhan which is linked to a seafood and animal market. This model is a two step experiment. 1101 471094 doi bioRxiv preprint in addition to DUX4 fl mRNA the mRNA levels of two mouse homologs of DUX4 FL direct target genes Wfdc3 and Trim36 41 68 were also assayed Figure 3B and C. Even for traits where single mutations might confer a major fitness advantage such as antiviral resistance genome scale interactions including epistasis Fortunately there are some evolutionary generalities that enable very broad scale predictions about viral emergence although none possess meaningful precision. Title How does the outbreak of 2019 nCoV spread in mainland China A retrospective analysis of the dynamic transmission routes Entity extraction method BERT Paragraph Number 1 Although the exact origin is still debatable the current shock namely 2019 nCoV has taken place in Wuhan the capital city of Hubei province in mainland China. As a natural product WDB002 would likely be harder to source than the molecules on which we have focused on here but may well merit investigation. COVID 19 has been of particular interest to our patients on immunosuppressive agents immunomodulators or biologics such as those with inflammatory bowel disease IBD. 2016 Warfield et al. It was proposed that the additional N67 glycan in DENV which is absent in other flaviviruses could promote a more efficient recognition and binding by MBL. The team used an integrated knowledge translation approach with consultation from the knowledge users from the WHO at the following stages question development interpretation of results and draft report. No reuse allowed without permission. Hence the change of N glycan profile of E protein after one round of replication in mammalian host cells may provide an opportunity to the virus to escape from effective MBL recognition Fuchs et al. Despite its pandemic nature there is very little information available in the public domain regarding the structures and functions of SARS CoV 2 proteins. Since DUX4 FL functions as a transcriptional activator in both human and mouse cells 30 68 expression of DUX4 FL direct target genes has proven to be a more accurate indicator of DUX4 FL expression levels in both species 24 31 41. Paragraph Number 3 Because the Expert Determination study established that no PHI will be disclosed by the Trend data export algorithm Data Use Agreements DUA rather than Business Associates Agreements BAA see Methods for the difference between a DUA and a BAA were executed 165 with each of the collaborating institutions listed in Table 3. Mean PPIDs in these ORF3a proteins are 9. International collaborations like CEPI have drawn extensive public private NGO and academic attention to the perils of global epidemic unpreparedness 18. Every time a query comes up the prescribed model will return a list of related papers with the paragraphs where the relevant answers to those queries can be found. Query 3 What do we know about vaccines and therapeutics Title Financing Vaccines for Global Health Security Extraction method Knowledge Graph Paragraph Number 1 In spite of these substantial difficulties or perhaps because of them new global initiatives have drawn attention to the need for new approaches to encourage the development of vaccines against EIDs 16 17. Moreover mild non specific symptoms and transmission before the onset of clinical symptoms 2 10 may compromise infection control measures for importations and onward transmissions 9. They are enveloped viruses with positive sense single stranded RNA and many of them are arthropod borne viruses. Although predictions are more robust when selection is extremely strong it is trivial to predict that resistance and often the causative mutations will arise to commonly used antivirals predictions of the evolution of more complex multi factorial traits such as host adaptation and emergence are a very different matter 10 11. Paragraph Number 2 The pandemic spread of the novel coronavirus SARS CoV2 is causing thousands of fatalities creating a tremendous threat to global health 1. 2 3 4 The central government and some provincial govern ments have provided food and medical supplies and dispatched expert groups and medical teams to manage and control the outbreak response in the hardesthit areas Wuhan and neighbouring cities in Hubei province. Among these for instance are components of the centriole such as CEP250 which interacts with the viral Nsp13. No information was found on any blood meals from bats being detected in Aedes Stegomyia species but it is unclear how much investigation has been done in this area. It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint which was not peer reviewed is the. Commercially available systems that can detect most of the known etiological agents for respiratory gastrointestinal and other multi pathogen syndromes 34 35 36 include the BioFire Salt Lake City UT FilmArray System 37 the GenMark Carlsbad CA eSensor XT 8 38 and ePlex 39 and the Luminex Austin TX xTAG 40 nxTag 41 and Verigene systems 42. Based on its similarity with Human SARS CoV and Bat CoV the published reports have suggested the functions of SARS CoV 2 proteins. 8 Gastroenterologists should be aware of these potential gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID 19. As the situation is monitored it will become clear if we can accomplish elimination. 10 Model compartments stratify the population into susceptible exposed symptomatic infected asymptomatic infected and recovered individuals. As of Feb 11 2020 the cumulative number of confirmed cases in mainland China has reached 38 800 with 4740 12 2 cured cases and 1113 2 9 deaths additionally there have been 16 067 suspected cases so far. However accurately reconstructed transmission trees with corresponding genetic sequence data are generally not available for most pathogens. Finally I propose to adopt the ratio between the cumulative number of recovered and the cumulative number of deceased persons as a potential indicator that can anticipate whether the spread of the epidemics is halting. Enhanced Entity Extraction using MeSH Ontology For every entity in the triple it s top 5 corresponding similar entities are extracted from the MeSH ontology. PubMed 21518887 Another important example of how epistatic interactions among mutations influence the probability of emergence. They apply to all residents regardless of suspected or confirmed infection status in all health care and long term residential care settings. What has been published about medical care 6. literatus from Grenada n 50 were also tested for antibodies against DENV 1 2 3 and 4 and none were seropositive 66. Within a single mouse one can assess differentially affected muscles. As a result we were empty handed when the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus MERS CoV a close relative of SARS CoV emerged in 2012. Although there is some variation in evolutionary rate among RNA viruses this does not appear to be related to the propensity to jump hosts. Based on evidence from the latest studies and expert recommendations as well as previous experiences from the prevention and control of SARS the National Health Commission of China launched a new notice on Feb 8 2020 15 which proposed strengthening health counselling screening and followups for pregnant women reinforcing visit time and procedures in obstetric clinics and units with specialised infection control preparations and protective clothing and emphasised that neonates of pregnant women with suspected or confirmed COVID19 infection should be isolated in a designated unit for at least 14 days after birth and should not be breastfed to avoid close contact with the mother while she has suspected or confirmed COVID19 infection. Paragraph Number 2 Overall these dose dependent DUX4 fl FSHD like phenotypic mouse models strongly support the DUX4 misexpression model for mediating FSHD pathogenesis 15 18 and provide a useful and highly flexible tool for performing FSHD preclinical testing of therapeutic approaches targeting DUX4 fl mRNA and protein. 5 billion trips annually of which over 40 are international. A marked suppression in fibrinolytic activity in local respiratory illnesses e. For example early attempts to predict the evolution of influenza virus as a guide for vaccine strain selection using the differential strength of positive selection among viral lineages gained little traction 9. For illustration we considered narrowing uncertainty around NPI effectiveness to either a 10 30 Paragraph Number 3 We developed an age structured dynamic compartmental model of COVID 19 transmission similar to previously published models. For instance the HDAC2 inhibitors may compound the potential action of the Nsp5 protease to hydrolyze this human protein. While mosquitoes in the subgenus Cx. Vaccine prices are currently set far below the prices of drugs that treat other serious conditions such as cancer despite the enormous societal value of vaccines in general and those to ensure global health security in particular. 6 We estimated a hospital capacity constraint using AHA estimates and assumed that 50 of beds could be available for COVID 19 patients. However if the countries to which the disease is exported have suitable health capacity the risk of establishment and ongoing transmission may be less of a concern 9 albeit nonnegligible. Our analysis revealed that in these three CoVs the N proteins are highly disordered possessing the PPID values of more than 60. The aligned images are created using Esprit 3. In genetic composition the SARS CoV 2 genome is very similar to SARS CoV each has an Orf1ab encoding 16 predicted Nsps and each has the four typical coronavirus structural proteins. Therefore it is critical that all members of the project have access to a clear description of underlying biology. Virologic and serologic reports in the literature demonstrate the exposure of bats worldwide to arboviruses arthropod borne viruses of medical and veterinary importance 1. 006643 doi bioRxiv preprint objective isolation is experienced by different human groups e. COVID 19 outbreaks in LMICs even if at somewhat lower incidence due to higher temperatures are still likely to have a substantial impact on health services that are already significantly resource constrained. 9 Two neonatal cases of COVID19 infection have been confirmed so far 10 with one case confirmed at 17 days after birth and having a close contact history with two confirmed cases the baby s mother and maternity matron and the other case confirmed at 36 h after birth and for whom the possibility of close contact history cannot be excluded. For COVID 19 evidence so far suggests that mortality among children is low while the elderly are at a much higher risk. 3 The clinical presentation of COVID 19 can range from mild non specific respiratory symptoms to severe organ dysfunction such as acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS that can lead to death. Positive social interactions in and of themselves may be basic human needs analogous to other basic needs like food consumption or sleep 10 11 12. 6 7 8 The incubation period for SARS CoV 2 appears to average 5. Title Fibrinolytic niche is requested for alveolar type 2 cell mediated alveologenesis and injury repair Extraction method Knowledge Graph Paragraph Number 1 The epithelial lining of regeneratively quiescent lungs is composed of alveolar type 2 AT2 progenitor and differentiated alveolar type 1 AT1 cells. These cases that went out of the radar and were not isolated are likely to have contributed strongly to the rapid spread of the virus. In eukaryotic systems ubiquitinated substrates engage productively with the proteasome if and only if they have low sequence complexity tags at their termini Kraut et al. How do infection prevention and control practices differ for adults aged 60 years and above living in long term care with respiratory illness and severe comorbidities or frailty differ than those without such severe comorbidities frailty 3. We prioritized several of these drugs based on potency or potential disease relevance including the antipsychotic Haloperidol which binds in the low nM range to both receptors 72 and Chloroquine which is currently in clinical trials for COVID 19 and has mid nM activity vs the Sigma1 receptor and low \u03bcM activity against the Sigma2 receptor. This rapid review of guidelines was completed in conjunction with a rapid overview of systematic reviews published in a separate report titled Preventing respiratory illness in older adults aged 60 years and above living in long term care A rapid overview of reviews.

Information on primary mosquito vectors feeding on bats is very limited. 11 On 30 January 2020 WHO declared the outbreak to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern PHEIC. Paragraph Number 2 We assumed that 33 of ascertained cases required hospitalization 12 and back calculated the proportion of all cases requiring hospitalizations for a given set of parameter values Supplemental Information. Using Cosine similarity to find the list of similar embeddings to that of input query. Researchers at Shanghai Mental Health Center developed a Covid 19 Peritraumatic Distress Index CPDI to assess the distress level specific to Covid 19 5. Title 4 What can we predict about viral evolution and emergence Extracted Method BERT Paragraph Number 1 There is a general and justifiable nervousness about predictions in evolutionary biology. Paragraph Number 3 The copyright holder for this preprint which was not peer reviewed is the. Paragraph Number 2 Bats and the viruses they harbor have been of interest to the scientific community due to the unique association with some high consequence human pathogens in the absence of overt pathology. More sophisticated methods have specified models of sequence evolution as components in a joint likelihood formalising expected genetic relationships in a probabilistic manner 5 6 7 8 9 20. Therefore here I set up to obtain an estimate of the lethality rate and the detection rate only based on the data reported for all countries in the John Hopkins University database 4. Nevertheless several aspects are still unclear and have not been thoroughly explored leaving grey areas in our knowledge of the disease and of the outbreak. For instance an increase in travelers to more vulnerable countries may increase the likelihood of exportation of cases to other countries thereby increasing the rapidity of global transmission. Does atopy affect the course of viral pneumonia 12. 5 Although initially a zoonotic virus SARS CoV 2 is now spread human to human with higher infectivity than MERS and SARS but a lower fatality rate. 97 respectively Supplementary Figure S2A. Sequence complexity is also lowered by using a simplified amino acid composition as we have done with the CTT sequences that are based on a reduced amino acid library. In Africa mosquito species in which bat blood meals have been identified and are known to be associated with a number of medically important arboviruses include Coquillettidia Cq. 20043315 doi medRxiv preprint Query 6 What do we know about virus genetics origin and evolution Title When Darkness Becomes a Ray of Light in the Dark Times Understanding the COVID 19 via the Comparative Analysis of the Dark Proteomes of SARS CoV 2 Human SARS and Bat SARS Like Coronaviruses Entity extraction method Knowledge Graph Paragraph Number 1 The copyright holder for this preprint which was not peer reviewed is the.

Studying both sexes from a cross provides more fine tuning of effects as well with females being slightly but significantly more affected than the males. The RNA genome Gen Bank accession code MN908947. The list of queries for which we derived results from our model are 1. Paragraph Extraction for related entities in extracted documents 1. Prior IBD research has found that viral infections are more likely among patients on immunomodulators such as 6 mercaptopurine and azathioprine than those on biologics but it is unclear if this can be extended to COVID 19. Paragraph Number 3 DENV belongs to the family Flaviviridae of which the members are well known as human pathogens including WNV Zika virus Yellow fever virus Tick borne encephalitis virus JEV and Hepatitis C virus HVC. In summary they are as follows Title What does simple power law kinetics tell about our response to coronavirus pandemic Extraction method BERT Paragraph Number 1 which was not peer reviewed The copyright holder for this preprint. We identified the tamoxifen TMX inducible and skeletal muscle specific Cre expressing transgenic mice ACTA1 MerCreMer or ACTA1 MCM 48 as a strong candidate for the generation of the desired phenotypes. Title Lessons learnt from 288 COVID 19 international cases importations over time effect of interventions underdetection of imported cases Entity extraction method BERT Paragraph Number 1 Twenty six countries worldwide have declared cases of the novel coronavirus COVID 19 as of February 20 2020 1. Paragraph Number 3 Bats and the viruses they harbor have been of interest to the scientific community due to the unique association with some high consequence human pathogens in the absence of overt pathology. We fit an age structured compartmental model to reported cases in the San Francisco Bay Area forecast a range of possible epidemic trajectories consistent with available information and then demonstrate how additional information about the impact of NPIs or the fraction of all infections that are confirmed positive would impact case predictions. Title Title Alpha ketoamides as broad spectrum inhibitors of coronavirus and enterovirus replication Structure based design synthesis and activity assessment Entity extraction method Knowledge Graph Paragraph Number 1 A number of capped dipeptidyl a ketoamides have been described as inhibitors of the norovirus 3C like protease. 20033357 doi medRxiv preprint Paragraph Number 3 The copyright holder for this preprint. We present here a simulation based approach for estimating the transmission divergence of different pathogens using parameters available in the literature namely the length of the pathogen genome L its overall mutation rate M its generation time distribution W i. They have a large genetic diversity. png RESULTS The results were good on the given dataset. For example although humans are more closely related to other primates than to rodents we probably have greater exposure to the latter. On January 10 2020 the WHO officially named this new coronavirus as the 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019 nCoV and released a comprehensive interim guidance on dealing with this new virus for all countries 11. One begins with an underlying transmission model attaching to this a model of sequence evolution that relates observed genetic relationships between pathogens to unobserved epidemiological relationships i. As we have shown here an isobutyl side chain in the P2 position of the inhibitors is too small to completely fill the S2 pocket of the EV A71 3C pro and the CVB3 3C pro. The key findings from these studies have been captured in a number of rapid COVID 19 guidelines produced by professional and global authorities. int the threat MERS CoV poses to global public health may be even more serious than that presented by SARS CoV. subtilis Figure 3B 6B also have the lowest LZ sequence complexity in their CTT sequences Figure 6E. We assume that within a UK context those that are defined as severe would be hospitalised. However the epidemiological significance of these observations is unclear as to whether or not bats are contributing to the circulation of arboviruses Paragraph Number 3 Historically a zoonotic virus reservoir has been considered a vertebrate species which develops a persistent infection in the absence of pathology or loss of function while maintaining the ability to shed the virus e. Details of the subset used is mentioned below. However a survey in Central and Southern Mexico analyzing 240 individuals representing 19 bat species by RT PCR resulted in no detection of viral nucleic acid 64. Title Transgenic mice expressing tunable levels of DUX4 develop characteristic facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy like pathophysiology ranging in severity Title FSHD like transgenic mouse models of varying severity Extraction method Knowledge Graph Paragraph Number 1 DUX4 FL protein was not detectable in heart or skeletal muscles from the non recombined In order to quantitate the changes in gene expression for each severity model qRT PCR was used to measure overall DUX4 fl mRNA levels Figure 3A. Title IMPACT OF VIRAL EPIDEMIC OUTBREAKS ON MENTAL HEALTH OF HEALTHCARE WORKERS A RAPID SYSTEMATIC REVIEW Extraction method Knowledge Graph Paragraph Number 1 The aim of this rapid systematic literature review is twofold i to examine the impact of health emergencies caused by a viral pandemic or epidemic on HCWs mental health and ii to assess the effectiveness of interventions to reduce such impact. Paragraph Number 2 In summary our study uncovers a novel role of the fibrinolytic niche in alveolarization via the uPA A6 CD44 and the uPA ENaC signaling pathways. Recent years have seen significant progress in the development of statistical and computational tools for inferring such trees 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 with a major emphasis placed on the analysis of whole genome sequence WGS data now routinely collected in many outbreak scenarios 16. 13 14 Nonetheless because of the small number of cases analysed and the short duration of the study period more followup studies should be done to further evaluate the safety and health of pregnant women and newborn babies who develop COVID19 infection. 2020 Majumder and Mandl 2020 Read et al. 44 Coded GC 375 this compound showed poor activity in cell culture against EV A71 though EC50 15. Among all flaviviruses DENV has the highest impact on global disease burden. There is also a chance that our literature search missed guidance documents from various state and provincial authorities. 3 Coronaviruses are a large family of RNA viruses that are known to cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome MERS and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome SARS. Genetic factors such as epistasis will greatly complicate any attempt to predict future viral evolution and emergence. This method aims at making this task easier for the researchers and scientists. The only countries that were able to keep the fraction of undetected infections low appear to be South Korea and Germany which explains their better ability to control the 7. MSA of SARS CoV 2 Human SARS and Bat CoV spike glycoproteins. This suggests that to reduce overall mortality interventions should. Although neonatal nasopharyngeal swab samples have been collected in some hospitals across China this study also collected and tested amniotic fluid cord blood and breastmilk samples for the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 thus allowing a more detailed assessment of the vertical transmission potential of COVID19 infection. 20033357 doi medRxiv preprint Table 3 Estimates of the proportion of all infections that would be hospitalised obtained from a subset of cases reported in mainland China 22. Mortality can also be expected to vary with the underlying health of specific populations given that the risks associated with COVID 19 will be heavily influenced by the presence of underlying co morbidities. Plau monolayers showed a lower ISC level compared to wt monolayer and diminished significantly by replacing Na free bath solution to inhibit Na ion transport Fig. This model uses the combination of Knowledge graphs with MeSH ontology and Bert embeddings. 1 Initially referred to as the 2019 novel coronavirus 2019 nCoV COVID 19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS CoV 2. Paragraph Number 3 Two approaches to the inference of transmission trees from WGS have emerged. What do we know about non pharmaceutical interventions 7. 15 19 20 Enteroviruses cause clinical disease much more frequently than coronaviruses so that an antiviral drug targeting both virus families should be commercially viable. However in implementation of the public Trend website which presents the national syndromic test surveillance Figure 1 we have further aggregated the data with respect to geographic origin and obfuscated the date of the test 8 see Methods. Paragraph Number 3 Here we systematically collected and analyzed data on 288 COVID 19 confirmed cases outside China. contamination in sample processing or read misclassifications. Moreover Plau AT2 cells showed a reduced amiloridesensitive ISC level compared to wt cells Fig. A Lancet correspondence noted that all aspects of prevention diagnosis and treatment are directly and indirectly hampered and the country Iran is falling short in combating the crisis. A real time surveillance system using diagnostic test results requires safeguards for protected health 105 information PHI. However this can lead to a poor representation of taxa in the diverse probe set it can become dominated by probes covering taxa that have more genetic diversity e. MSA of SARS CoV 2 Human SARS and Bat CoV Nsp5 proteins. Transmission divergence can be estimated empirically from a transmission tree by determining the number of mutations separating pathogen samples of known transmission pairs. Does genetic diversity limit disease spread in natural host populations 9. This gives us a list of selected documents which are related to the input query based on both knowledge graphs and BERT. Paragraph Number 2 Since December 2019 the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease COVID19 infection has become a major epidemic threat in China. The serum of Jamaican fruit bats Artibeus jamaicensis and Great fruit eating bats A. Detectable DUX4 fl mRNA levels were extremely low in gastrocnemius muscles from all models Figure 3A consistent with previous studies 41. These challenges are evidenced by the few arboviruses for which there are substantial field and laboratory data involving the infection of bats. sepsis has been reported clinically and in animal models7 8. 1 have required admission to the intensive care unit. The proteolysis of extracellular matrix substrates by urokinase plasminogen activator uPA could be involved in the benefit of the fibrinolytic niche to the regeneration of skeletal muscles and fractured cartilage13 17. Three independent analysis for each of these two sera were repeated on the microarray. 11 To better understand the impact of globalization on our ability to mitigate infectious disease threats we sought to describe trends in air passenger numbers over a 10 year period 2007 2016 and investigate if connectivity between countries with different levels of resilience has changed over this time period. Healthcare personnel entering the room should use standard precautions contact precautions gown and gloves airborne precautions with N95 respirator and eye protection goggles or a face shield. Reverse genetic deletion in the coding sequence of Nsp2 of the SARS virus attenuated little viral growth and replication and allowed the recovery of mutant virulent viruses. 6 8 Among hospitalized COVID 19 patients it is reported that 5 to 26. At the national and international level travel restrictions have been implemented for regions with the highest COVID 19 incidence currently but these recommendations and polices are likely to rapidly change and warrant close monitoring. If the newly created cross species pathogens acquires the ability to infect humans or to be transmitted human to human it can lead to occasional spillover events and epidemics. We excluded South Sudan from these analyses as FSI data were only available from 2012 onwards. Owing to the absence of vaccines the slow connections between people and isolation between infectious and susceptible were the only remedies to their devastating effects. The Covid 19 outbreak in Iran has been compounded by the ongoing decade long US led sanctions on Iran. One of the best established is that viruses are more likely to jump between closely related species 15 16. But in some cases we were having one or two extra results from either of the two methods which were not overlapping. However we have previously shown that this assay is a poor measure of DUX4 fl transgene expression using FLExDUX4 mouse models 41 and DUX4 fl mRNA is even difficult to detect in muscle biopsies from FSHD affected subjects 16. and assessed as being suitable roommates. The SARS CoV 2 virus shares 79. 7 Early reports suggest that for more severe cases the median time from first symptom onset to the development of shortness of breath and or need for hospitalization ranged from 5 to 8 days. Similarly drugs exist to target several well known epigenetic regulators prominent among the human interactors including HDAC2 BRD2 and BRD4 which interact with viral proteins nsp5 and E respectively Figs. It is equally well known that RNA viruses jump species boundaries more often than DNA viruses and that this likely reflects their differing rates of evolutionary change 8 17. Among them the well known chemical probe Bafilomycin A1 is a potent inhibitor of the V1 ATPase subunits of which interact with Nsp6 and M. However mammalian cell derived DENV was found to be effectively inhibited and neutralized by mouse MBL. The speed with which COVID 19 initially overwhelmed health systems in many countries as well as the ability of several countries to drive cases down successfully suggests that the current best approach is to implement all feasible interventions against COVID 19 to suppress the disease. This provides even greater flexibility and utility for the model as a tool for studying FSHD and testing potential therapeutic approaches. The RTC consists of multiple enzymes including the papain like protease Nsp3 the main protease Nsp5 the Nsp7 Nsp8 primase complex the primary RNA dependent RNA polymerase Nsp12 a helicase triphosphatase Nsp13 an exoribonuclease Nsp14 an endonuclease Nsp15 and N7 and 2 O methyltransferases Nsp10 Nsp16 1 16 17. A new type of coronavirus was isolated on 7 January 2020. Although such data will not enable us to predict future emergence with any certainty it may allow broad scale conclusions as to which groups of viruses are most likely to emerge in humans which animal species in which geographical locations need to be surveyed most intensively and how evolution will proceed following a host jump. Paragraph Number 2 Vaccines only sell for a fraction of their economic value in some cases for only a few dollars. 2 Today commercial air travel is the conduit for approximately 3. Reviewed by Kuno et al. The identification of those who are more likely to suffer mentally enables more targeted assistance from caregivers and policymakers especially given the limited resources relative to the scale of the pandemic 1 3. Paragraph Number 3 During this anti epidemic war statistic and mathematical modeling plays a non negligible role. The presence of an incubation period during which infected individuals carry on their usual activities including travel is a major challenge for screening controls at airports 8. Caution is warranted in extrapolating the association between local COVID 19 case counts and temperature to LMICs in tropical regions. Title How lethal is the novel coronavirus and how many undetected cases there are The importance of being tested Extraction method BERT Paragraph Number 1 The main result of this work is that due to the reduced number of performed tests the vast majority of the coronavirus infections went undetected in most countries. Here we use the Lempel Ziv LZ measure of complexity Lempel and Ziv 1976 that has been used in previous analysis of IDPs IDRs Romero et al. Sixteen of 20 field collected Ae. However we were unable to perform an exhaustive grey literature search of websites due to the timelines imposed on this review. Has_title The nouns and pronouns are extracted from the title using Spacy and also we have added DBPedia and Scispacy Models. smiling faces activate neural reward systems 13 for review. Although other proteins have shown lower disorder content almost all of them contain at least some IDPRs and all CoV proteins author funder. Performing fuzzy match of the entities on the triples used to create the Knowledge graph from step 2 using fuzzy match to get the list of documents with their hits. 2 Interactive cloud hosted models Every prototype version is rapidly transformed into a cloud hosted interactive model to permit faster scientific communication across communities particularly with virologists and others who have essential insights but ordinarily would not directly run the simulation models. In this situation the society is strongly concerned by the lethality and the true extension of the pandemics see for instance 2 3. transmission pairs between infected individuals. Dataset Creation This is a pilot model. These methods ought to comprehensively cover known sequence diversity ideally with theoretical guarantees especially given the exceptional variability of viral genomes. Title 3 Can Bats Serve as Reservoirs for Arboviruses Extracted Method Knowledge Graph Paragraph Number 1 DENV nucleic acid and anti DENV antibodies have been detected in Mexican bats on the Gulf and Pacific coast and nucleic acid has been detected in the liver and or sera of wild caught bats in French Guiana 62 63. Maternal and parental mental health problems are associated with longer term risks for the mother and partner and for their children 2 3 4 5. org t initialgenome release of novel coronavirus 319 last accessed on January 11 2020 of the new betacoronavirus features around 82 identity to that of SARS CoV. To alleviate these issues we allow different choices of parameters governing hybridization for different subsets of input sequences so that some can have probes designed with more relaxed assumptions than others. Title Estimates of the severity of COVID 19 disease Entity extraction method BERT Paragraph Number 1 The copyright holder for this preprint. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses PRISMA Statement 3 to guide the reporting of our rapid review results a PRISMA extension for rapid reviews is currently under development. Extraction of entities from the input query using noun pronouns and pre defined function for entity extraction from Spacy. 9 11 However pregnant women with COVID19 infection in the present study had fewer adverse maternal and neonatal complications and outcomes than would be anticipated for those with SARSCoV1 infection. Although informative numerous exceptions arise because the probability of exposure does not match phylogenetic relatedness. Interestingly we find that the variants that have low cellular levels in B. We derived initial ranges for model parameters including length of incubation and infectious periods and the basic reproductive number R0 by drawing from prior COVID 19 modeling studies Table 1 and from prior studies on age specific contact patterns sources in Supplemental Information. We commend these researchers for their timely contribution and those who made the data publicly available. the Zika virus Chikungunya virus etc. Although a small number of cases was analysed and the findings should be interpreted with caution the findings are mostly consistent with the clinical analysis done by Zhu and colleagues 12 of ten neonates born to mothers with COVID19 pneumonia. Entity extraction from JSON documents Entities are extracted from the title author details abstract body and bibliographical references for every JSON document. Specifically we model transmission trees alongside sequence evolution and extract the number of mutations separating individual transmission pairs. However research on the neural representation of unmet human social needs is lacking 14. Title Capturing diverse microbial sequence with comprehensive and scalable probe design Entity extraction method Knowledge Graph Paragraph Number 1 To enhance capture of diverse targets we instead need rigorous methods implemented in publicly available software that can be systematically applied to create and rapidly update optimally designed probe sets. This work underscored the importance of the disordered CTL in FtsZ assembly and Z ring formation. 100 Multi analyte diagnostic tests provide the raw data needed for real time pathogen specific surveillance but there remain a number of obstacles to sharing these results reviewed in 43. Paragraph Number 2 This illustrates the importance of factoring in mortality among specific groups when deciding on the type of interventions to implement. 3 We live in an increasingly connected world with more people traveling further distances than prior generations and decreased times required to travel these increased distances. 2012 Schrader et al. Interestingly single stranded DNA viruses exhibit rates of evolutionary change similar to those of RNA viruses 17 and may frequently cross species boundaries 18. These tools are used to dissect the genome and genetic makeup of a pathogen for developing a potential vaccine. 5 of the genetic sequence of SARS and has 96. There needs to be a viable sustainable business model that will align the financial incentives of stakeholders to encourage the necessary investment in vaccine development 19 20. Although the exact origin remains debatable 4 the fourth outbreak has taken place in Hubei province of China in December 2019 and rapidly spread out nationally 5 6 7 8 9 10. In all locations pressure on critical care treatment is likely if there is a sustained increase in cases of COVID 19. Title How lethal is the novel coronavirus and how many undetected cases there are The importance of being tested Entity extraction method BERT Paragraph Number 1 The main result of this work is that due to the reduced number of performed tests the vast majority of the coronavirus infections went undetected in most countries. Replacing the wildtype WT CTL with a scrambled sequence variant of the linker preserves Z ring formation and cell division. Lack of medical pharmaceutical and laboratory equipment such as protective gowns and necessary medication has been scaling up the burden of the epidemic and the number of casualties 7. People with higher pre existing chronic loneliness also showed a muted response in SN VTA to social cues after acute isolation r 38 0. While many studies have presented serologic data indicative of past exposure of free ranging bats to arboviruses of medical and veterinary importance these studies should be followed up with laboratory assessments of reservoir host competence to shed light on the true epidemiological significance of the field data. decens group WNV chikungunya Babanki viruses 148 178. MSA of SARS CoV 2 Human SARS and Bat CoV Nsp15 proteins. Early research has found working adults in more affected areas in China had worse health conditions more distress and lower life satisfactions 3. Paragraph Number 2 As the disease continues to spread many researchers have already published their analyses of the outbreak as pre prints e. However adoption of IVD platforms with 95 broad multiplexing capability has become widespread only in the last few years. Despite this they are less appropriate in identifying transmission routes of the 2019 nCoV outbreak which is also not thoroughly investigated in existing literature. 5 Although travel has always been associated with the introduction of pathogens to new environments and populations the speed with which these new introductions occurs has been enhanced as population mobility increases. Paragraph Number 2 The current experiment was conducted to develop potential vaccines against the Wuhan novel coronavirus strain SARS CoV 2 Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus exploiting the strategies of reverse vaccinology Figure 01. Extraction of titles from all JSON documents. Given a natural language query return relevant documents from the corpus having semantically similar meaning. Rather Vicente Santos and colleagues surmised a spillover event from humans to bats with bats functioning as a dead end host 65. Title What does simple power law kinetics tell about our response to coronavirus pandemic Entity extraction method BERT Paragraph Number 1 which was not peer reviewed The copyright holder for this preprint. In the 1800s the slow march of the second cholera pandemic could be observed to follow trade and military campaign routes out of India to Central Asia the Middle East Europe and eventually North America over the course of years. Are high performing health systems resilient against the COVID 19 epidemic 4. when chosen intentionally solitude can be restful and rejuvenating 80 81 our isolation paradigm was subjectively aversive participants felt more uncomfortable and less happy at the end of the day. Multiple sequence alignment of non structural proteins of all three studied coronaviruses are generated using Clustal Omega. There is a critically important gap in our knowledge about how pandemics affect mothers and their babies and how pregnant women mothers and their families can be better supported. S We tried BERT only document extraction after training on all the document titles and also extracted results for some other question going ahead we will add Mesh Enabled knowledge graph for these questions also. For texts where there weren t enough candidates for keyphrase extraction entities are extracted just the same way as that for abstract along with DBPedia and Scipacy Model. However no reliable evidence is as yet available to support the possibility of vertical transmission of COVID19 infection from the mother to the baby. Cues associated with positive social interaction e. The ability of Celgosivir treatment a bicyclic iminosugar that inhibits glycosylation through negatively binding to ER alpha glucosidase II to protect mice from a lethal DENV challenge indirectly demonstrates the importance of glycosylation in DENV virulence Perry et al. We predicted that individual variability in response to objective isolation might reflect pre existing differences in participants social network size and or chronic loneliness. While this impact undoubtedly varies across different methods the intrinsic informativeness of genetic data with respect to the underlying transmission tree can be evaluated. For sequencing some ultra low input samples targeted amplicon approaches may be faster and more sensitive 38 but genome size sequence heterogeneity and the need for prior knowledge of the target species can limit the feasibility and sensitivity of these approaches 1 56 57. Globally the extent and adverse impacts of maternal mental health problems are increasingly recognised. Both Sigma1 and Sigma2 are promiscuous receptors that interact with many non polar cationic drugs. 35 billion of all international trips in 2016. All the analyses were implemented in the R environment 11. When information regarding onset of symptoms of the first reported case was missing the confirmation date of the first reported case was used instead. 3A B consistent with our previous studies in the airway epithelial cells27. 16 There are no data currently about the impact of immunosuppressive agents although one of the largest case series from China did note that 2 patients with immunodeficiency not further specified had non severe disease. Of course epidemiologists can estimate the lethality rate in a less biased way with additional data on the dates in which the infections of the persons that die or recover were detected and better sampling of the population. hundreds of viral species. We provide the first empirical evidence on Iranian adults level of distress and identify several predictors of their distress under the Covid 19 pandemic. Paragraph Number 3 4. A 2017 study by Vicente Santos and colleagues examined 12 bat species from Costa Rica and found a cumulative seroprevalence of 21. The cessation of virtual social interaction was a substantial change typical young adults currently use social media for social interactions more than two hours per day 83. 1 Coronaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses which are broadly distributed either in humans or in a vast majority of other mammals and birds. Paragraph Number 2 The challenge of predicting viral evolution and emergence is reflected in the on going debate over whether highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza virus will emerge in humans. perfuscus Edwards WNV Oropouche Sindbis Wesselsbron Usutu Babanki viruses Cx.

This refers to any public or private aged care disability services or other congruent accommodation setting in Victoria where residents are provided with personal care or health care by facility staff. It can also be extended to give inference on how different documents are related to each other based on author body title etc. Paragraph Number 3 Many LMICs had not detected a COVID 19 case as of 29 th February 2020 and therefore were not included in this analysis. What can we predict about viral evolution and emergence 7. int ageing long term care WHO LTC series subsaharan africa. Paragraph Number 2 The obstacles largely center on information privacy and network security. 2020a and in peer reviewed journals e. Bats have long been suspected as reservoirs for arboviruses 11 but experimental data that would support a role of bats as reservoir hosts for certain arboviruses remain difficult to collect. More evidence is needed to develop effective preventive and clinical strategies. To test if these could be used to generate mosaic expression in skeletal muscles and to optimize TMX dosing the ACTA1 MCM mice were crossed with R26 NZG Cre reporter mice 49 that produce readily detectable nuclear \u00dfgalactosidase nLacZ expression in all cells where Cre is functional in the nucleus Figure S1. For each ADM1 an observation period was defined as period from the date of onset of symptoms of the first reported case for that ADM1 to February 29 th 2020. Has_reference The entities for this relation are extracted the same way as that for abstract along with DBPedia and Scispacy Model. Initially our knowledge graph model was trained only on 12 selective documents. 5 kinds of relationships are included in the triples. Paragraph Number 2 The emergence of new viruses and associated deaths around the globe represent one of the major concerns of modern times. Title Guidelines for preventing respiratory illness in older adults aged 60 years and above living in long term care A rapid review of clinical practice guidelines Extraction method Knowledge Graph Paragraph Number 1 1. 981 for IgG and IgM respectively and the overall fluorescence intensity ranges of the repeated experiments were fairly close demonstrating high reproducibility of the microarray based serum profiling both for IgG and IgM Fig. These results indicate that the IDPs IDPRs of this protein could be utilized in molecular recognition protein protein protein RNA and protein DNA interaction. these criteria include the periodic isolation of the infectious agent from the vertebrate species in the absence of seasonal vector activity and the coincidence of transmission with vector activity 9. 2 days but may range from 2 to 14 days and potential asymptomatic infection has been reported. Capture does increase the preparation cost and time per sample compared to unbiased metagenomic sequencing but this is offset by reduced sequencing costs through increased sample pooling and or lower depth sequencing 1 Supplementary Table 9. These protein binding regions in ORF3a may have role in its co localization with E M and S viral proteins. 2 51 241 by PRNT and a prevalence of 8. Chikungunya virus emergence is constrained in Asia by lineage specific adaptive landscapes. inhaled smoke and aspirated gastric juice and pulmonary complications of systemic diseases e. 9 and 229E 10 that usually cause only mild respiratory symptoms in otherwise healthy individuals but are much more widespread than SARS CoV or MERS CoV. gov psd accessed March 4 th 2020. Previous studies have shown that SARS during pregnancy is associated with a high incidence of adverse maternal and neonatal complications such as spontaneous miscarriage preterm delivery intrauterine growth restriction application of endotracheal intu bation admission to the intensive care unit renal failure and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. Paragraph Number 2 An open source line list of confirmed COVID 19 cases was downloaded on March 2 nd 2020 8. Title 4 Are high performing health systems resilient against the COVID 19 epidemic Extracted Method Knowledge Graph Paragraph Number 1 Are high performing health systems resilient against the COVID 19 epidemic Paragraph Number 2 As of March 5 2020 there has been sustained local transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 in Hong Kong Singapore and Japan. Based on term frequency voting mechanism top 3 paragraphs for every selected title document is selected. As a final example we were intrigued to observe that the SARS CoV 2 Nsp6 protein interacts with the Sigma receptor which is thought to regulate ER stress response 71. 42 published a series of a ketoamides as inhibitors of the EV A71 3C pro. Title What does simple power law kinetics tell about our response to coronavirus pandemic Extraction method BERT Paragraph Number 1 To the best of my knowledge of the scientific understanding of coronavirus at the point of writing this article Paragraph Number 2 The effect of weather on the spread of pandemic has not been established. 2020 focusing in particular on estimates of the basic reproductive number R 0 i. Considering arboviruses additional criteria must be met in order to consider a particular vertebrate species a reservoir. In contrast replacing the CTL with a rigid alpha helical domain from human betacatenin yielded diffuse FtsZ puncta that compromise Z ring formation and cell division Buske and Levin 2013. 1 6 7 Most cases of COVID 19 appear to be mild with the most common symptoms being fever 83 98 cough 46 82 myalgia fatigue 11 44 and shortness of breath 31. The sequence complexity of CTT sequences is lowered either by increasing or decreasing \u03ba within the CTT for the WT amino acid composition or by using a reduced alphabet for the amino acid composition. Thus the ENaC activity seems to be regulated by the Plau gene. Paragraph Number 3 This result is consistent with recent reports from China 8 9 and with the high rates of asymptomatic but positive cases observed in Vo Euganeo Italy 10 in the cruise ship Diamond Princess 11 and among children 12 see also 13. Paragraph Number 3 We examined trends in FSI score trends in worldwide air travel and the association between a state s FSI score and air travel. This apparent cooperativity is at odds with the observation that FtsZ forms stable singlestranded filaments which is the defining characteristic of isodesmic assembly Oosawa and Kasai 1962. 4 While this interconnectedness is a defining feature of globalization and has produced tremendous benefits for humankind it has also facilitated the geographic dispersion of infectious diseases. 11 ACE2 is important in controlling intestinal inflammation and its disruption may lead to diarrhea. These viruses have the possibility to cause respiratory enteric hepatic and neurologic diseases. Title If long term suppression is not possible how do we minimize mortality for COVID 19 and other emerging infectious disease outbreaks Entity extraction method BERT Paragraph Number 1 Arguably even more important than minimizing cases is minimizing deaths. Because many patients are already treated with drugs that have off target impact on Sigma receptors associating clinical outcomes accompanying treatment with these drugs may merit investigation a point to which we return. We outline some of the core dimensions of these resilient health systems 4 and their responses to the COVID 19 epidemic. 990598 doi bioRxiv preprint Non structural protein 2 Nsp2. The per residues predisposition for the intrinsic disorder of Nsp2s from SARS CoV 2 Human SARS CoV and Bat CoV are depicted in Figures 20A 20B and 20C. We even took an example of a very specific medical term CYP6F1 protein which was not present in any of the documents taken. 5 degree spatial resolution were obtained from the Climate Prediction Centre NOAA OAR ESRL PSD Boulder Colorado USA https www. Travel between countries included in the FSI rankings represented 95 1. Paragraph Number 2 To the best of my knowledge of the scientific understanding of coronavirus at the point of writing this article Paragraph Number 3 The effect of weather on the spread of pandemic has not been established. Similarly although rates of recombination or reassortment vary greatly among viruses these appear to be of little predictive power as a case in point paramxyoviruses such as measles and the emerging henipaviruses experience extremely low rates of recombination if they recombine at all yet frequently jump species 19. Numerous models have been developed to describe how FtsZ assembles cooperatively. A simple implementation involves ruling out direct transmission events between individuals separated by more than a fixed threshold of substitutions 17 18 19. Apart from MoRFs it also displays several nucleotide binding residues in all three viruses see Supplementary Tables 9 10 and 11. Title The distress of Iranian adults during the Covid 19 pandemic More distressed than the Chinese and with different predictors The distress of Iranian adults during the Covid 19 pandemic More distressed than the Chinese and with different predictors Summary Background Entity extraction method BERT Paragraph Number 1 Covid 19 disrupts lives and work and causes psychological distress to the general public 1 2 3 4. ca en health canada services home continuing care long term facilitiesbased care. In addition a greater RTE value on day 5 was measured in wt monolayers compared to Plau monolayer cultures Fig. 7 9 Of note for gastroenterologists patients may complain of gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea or diarrhea. Title The need to connect Acute social isolation causes neural craving responses similar to hunger Extraction method Knowledge Graph Paragraph Number 1 In sum these results suggest that across all participants SN VTA shows an increased response to social cues after objective social isolation in a pattern that is similar to the response to food cues when hungry the magnitude of this response was variable across participants and larger in those who reported more social craving after the acute isolation period. Paragraph Number 3 Polymerase RdRP inhibitor remdesivir 9 10 11 and recent data suggests a new nucleotide analog may be effective against SARS CoV 2 infection in laboratory animals 12. According to this analysis the following regions in Nsp2 proteins are predicted to be disordered residues 570 595 SARS CoV 2 residues 110 115 Human SARS and residues 112 116 Bat CoV. To test the experimental reproducibility of the serum profiling using the microarray two COVID 19 convalescent sera were random selected. Our results have tested the potential novel contribution of uPA PAI1 A6 CD44 ENaC cascade to the fibrinolytic niche in regulating the fate of AT2 cells. Top 3 document titles as the dataset was limited to 12 documents we took only the top 3 with maximum hits are taken from the knowledge graph. Intriguingly a very recent patent disclosure revealed a natural product WDB002 that directly and specifically targets CEP250. quinquefasciatus and Cx. are recognized as primary vectors of WNV Sindbis Babanki and Usutu viruses only for Babanki virus has additional field data been collected so far that support a potential role for bats in virus circulation discussed above 29. 5 It is generally assumed that increased numbers of international travelers will increase global vulnerability to infectious diseases by enhancing the potential for geographic spread. 10 Increased connectivity also increases the likelihood of introduction of pathogens via infected tourists to less resilient countries where disease establishment is a risk. Getting the list of embeddings for all the titles using BERT. For our participants who are all highly socially connected a day of social isolation was a very large deviation from typical rates of social interaction. Paragraph Number 2 The role of glycosylation and glycan structures in DENV virulence has yet to be reported with evidence of attenuated phenotypes in symptomatic mouse models. 12 13 So while COVID 19 appears to primarily spread through respiratory droplets and secretions the gastrointestinal tract may be another potential route of infection highlighting importance of personal protective equipment during endoscopy. The fibrinolytic niche in alveolar epithelial homeostasis and regeneration mediated by AT2 cells however has not been studied systematically. Paragraph Number 2 We will gather community consensus and pool efforts into a standardized model that captures key SARS CoV 2 dynamics. Paragraph Number 3 Using this model and the available statistical data we attempt predictions on the Covid 19 epidemic trend. 8 Human SARS and 6. Permissive secondary mutations enable the evolution of influenza oseltamivir resistance. Rather recovery and isolation of live virus at biologically relevant titers and demonstrating the persistence of the pathogen in nature among connected populations of a potential reservoir species is more definitive. High antibody responses were usually observed for COVID 19 patients while not in control sera Fig. In fact this represents maximum number of RNA and DNA binding residues as compared with all other accessory proteins. Finally in addition to the druggable host factors a few of which we have highlighted here the SARS CoV 2 human interactome reveals many traditionally undruggable targets. The potential for human to human transmission of MERS CoV has been impressively demonstrated by the 2015 outbreak in South Korea where 186 cases could be traced back to a single infected traveller returning from the Middle East. MSA of SARS CoV 2 Human SARS and Bat CoV Nsp12 proteins. png Problem Statement 1. The sequence identity of the Nsp2 protein from SARS CoV 2 with Nsp2s of Human SARS CoV and Bat CoV amounts to 68. MBL differentiates self from non self antigens based on a sugar density dependent recognition mechanism Dam and Brewer 2010 and the micro pattern of the oligosaccharides structure in addition to the spatial geometry of the macro sugar pattern Takahashi and Ezekowitz 2005. 2 http virological. 0 International license It is made available under a is the author funder who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. 03 of annual passenger flows. Targeting the abnormality of the fibrinolytic niche could be a promising pharmaceutic strategy to accelerate reparative processes of injured alveolar epithelium in clinical disorders such as ARDS. In the current paradigm isolation was likely made more salient by the externally mandated not personally chosen restrictions on participants behaviour including bans on email social media fiction films music and other forms of virtual and fictional connectedness 82 though participants did have access to games puzzles and reading material. The entities are mapped to their respective paper ids with these relations Has_author Direct extraction of author s first and last name. These models suggest that FtsZ subunits might undergo conformational changes to facilitate the population of a high affinity state that favors polymerization Miraldi et al. This might mean re opening schools before re starting other activities mainly frequented by adults or the elderly. Paragraph Number 2 Victoria State Government 2018 Country Australia Sponsor Victoria State Government Scope guidelines apply to all residential care facilities RCFs in Victoria. 01 that is frequently mentioned in the media. 2 Bat CoV SARS like. 20051797 doi medRxiv preprint citizens to avoid physical contacts 2 limiting social gathering 3 closing academic institutions 4 strict lockdown with only essential services open.

In context in which there are increasing human animal interactions novel coronaviruses are very likely to emerge periodically. Title Commentary Title COVID 19 and maternal mental health Are we getting the balance right Extraction method BERT Paragraph Number 1 Even though there is plenty of scientific evidences and experience based knowledge in several fields from the previous two coronaviruses the research on MERS CoV and SARS CoV and pregnancy childbirth is still limited especially in terms of maternal mental health. adolescents older adults and how this experience is modulated by social media usage. We could run CATCH as described above on a single choice of parameters \u03b8 d such that the number of probes in s d \u03b8 d is feasible for synthesis. Targeted biochemical and structural studies will also be crucial for a deeper understanding of the viral host complexes which will inform more targeted drug design. the average number of secondary infections caused by an index case in a fully susceptible population 25. Paragraph Number 3 There are several limitations to the review methods employed here single screening and abstraction for example however they were selected to thoughtfully tailor our methods according to our knowledge user needs and the urgent nature of the request to provide timely results. 8 17 Last the best measures to decrease the risk of contracting SARS CoV 2 are the same as standard practices against any viral illness. Previously we showed that mosaic expression of DUX4 fl in skeletal muscle of FLExDUX4 transgenic mice or FLExD can produce a very severe myopathy with FSHD like pathology 41. They provide myriad benefits like enabling would be patients to live longer healthier lives 33 34 and bearing yet undervalued gains in productivity and positive externalities to society at large 35 36 37. Paragraph Number 3 Occasionally individual a ketoamides have been reported in the literature as inhibitors of both the enterovirus 3C protease and the coronavirus main protease. Although being alone is not inherently aversive for people i. Although the virus is believed to have originated from animal reservoirs Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2020 the ability of SARS CoV 2 ability to directly transmit between humans has posed a greater threat for its spread World Health Organization 2020c. If so the absence of positive social interaction may create a want or craving that motivates behavior to repair what is lacking 10. 36 than to the ORF3a of Human SARS CoV 72. 1101 471094 doi bioRxiv preprint mouse models varying in severity and pathogenic progression based on differing levels of mosaic expression of the pathogenic DUX4 fl mRNA isoform of human DUX4 in adult murine skeletal muscle. png Abstract A large amount data is available and it is difficult for researchers to go through each and every paper every time a query comes up. Finding the embedding for the input query using BERT 4. Culiseta morsitans Theobald mosquitoes vector of Eastern equine encephalitis virus were found to have fed on Eastern pipistrelle bats Pipistrellus subflavus but these blood meals comprised only 1 of the total blood meals identified from this mosquito species 177. We are particularly encouraging feedback and data contributions by domain experts in virology epidemiology and mathematical biology with a focus 4 Frequent preprint updates Each model iteration is accompanied by a cloud hosted interactive app see 2 and an updated preprint on bioRxiv. Such research on mental health during the Covid 19 pandemic is critical to identify and screen people psychiatrically based on their distress levels to prioritize assistance 2 6. 14 Starting from the second half of January 2020 scientific literature has been particularly focused on the description of this new viral outbreak the main topics addressed were the epidemiological clinical and virological aspects as well as the possible public health choices necessary to contain the spread of the disease. Therefore pregnant women and newborn babies should be considered key atrisk populations in strategies focusing on prevention and management of COVID19 infection. Paragraph Number 3 Travel restrictions between countries are very useful in the initial phases of the pandemic but have little effect in the later phases. HEK 293T cells were co transfected with pGL IFN \u03b2 luc pRL TK and various 444 dilutions of a vector control VP35 WT or VP35 S129A. extended this definition of a reservoir to include epidemiologically connected populations or environments in which the pathogen can be permanently maintained and from which infection is transmitted to the defined target population. 1101 301622 doi bioRxiv preprint lowered sequence complexity. Conditions such as extreme stress emergency and conflict situations and natural disasters can increase risks for specific mental health disorders 1. Similarly other undruggable targets may be revealed to have compounds that could usefully perturb the viral human interaction network and act as leads to therapeutics. 0 International license author funder. Given the impact of glycosylation in virus entry and virus fitness in mammalian cells it is highly likely that deglycosylated DENV mutants will display reduced virulence in vivo.
