The PatchGAN has an effective receptive field of 70x70 ie. Most of the computer vision tasks involve grayscale images because they retain the basic structure and to reduce the computation cost. Following are the papers I referred to for understanding the different concepts and models to implement 1 M. jpg Modified U net Architecture Generator The generator is a modified U net model. Refer 2 for more information on these models. Using SVD we can compute the maximum singular value of a matrix A. The field of image colourisation has seen significant developments in recent years. Expanding path. Image to Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks. com tensorflow docs blob master site en tutorials generative images dis. We will be working only on 40 of images in both the folders due to hardware constrains. PatchGAN Discriminator The discriminator is a PatchGAN model which takes in both the grayscale image and coloured image and evaluates whether the coloured image is a valid transformation of the grayscale input. 2018 IEEE CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition 2018 8798 8807. The Instance Normalization layer 5 was applied for last decoding layer u064. First the image is compressed to the bottleneck layer and then it is upsampled to the output layer.

State of the art models based on GANs Generative Adversarial Networks Goodfellow et. com max 1050 1 jHMt dliKmrPELj6hrRyGg. NormalizationBATCH NORMALIZATION was first introduced in Szegedy et. Lempitsky Instance normalization The missing ingredient for fast stylization arXiv 1607. This can be done either by increasing the depth of the discriminator or by larger convolutions both of which are memory intensive. First let s look at the basic architecture. datasets Load models Loss functions Generator loss Gloss https github. The slope of the function at any point is always less than or equal to K. It was found to be useful in style transfer methods. The basic structure of encoding path is Conv BatchNorm LeakyReLU slope 0. High Resolution Image Synthesis and Semantic Manipulation with Conditional GANs. de people ronneber u net u net architecture. for encoding and decoding respectively. every single cell in the output array tells the probability of a 70x70 patch being real or fake. So to discard the contrast information of content image instance normalization was applied. Model ArchitectureThe model is based on Pix2Pix architecture 2 with additions of normalizations 3 4 and multiscale discriminators 5. The main modification made in the original architecture is Using single convolution layer instead of two. In both cases Spectral Normalization 3 was applied. UpdatesIn the version 7 of the notebook I used the base Pix2Pix GAN model for image colourisation. com tensorflow docs blob master site en tutorials generative images gen. Apart from the adversarial loss the model weights are also trained with the L1 loss introduced between generated image and ground truth. Lipchitz constant can also be calculated as the maximum absolute value to first derivative of f. Loss functionThe model is trained using an adversarial loss function where the Discriminator takes in the generated image target image and evaluates whether it is a correct transformation of the original input image. png raw 1 Calculate discriminator loss for real and fake inputs accross all image resolutions ie. _________________. They are mentioned below in brief. io assets Images MLDLStudy What is patchGAN D 2. More information can be found here. Images of different resolutions Optimizer Training for each batch fit method NoteThe models have parameter training True so that the batch statistics are calculated eg. where at each step the size of the image is halved and depth is doubled. Also the weights of the previous layers are updated during training. O Connor End to End Conditional GAN based Architectures for Image Colourisation 2019 IEEE 21st International Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing MMSP 2019 pp. To mitigate the lack of colourfulness this model architecture was proposed. Bottleneck layer. PatchGAN Discriminator The PatchGAN discriminator is made up of down sampling blocks d_block. com max 656 1 H8WrL_Xqxdle8qWgMr82tA. png SPECTRAL NORMALIZATION was introduced in 3. K is called the Lipchitz Constant. dis_gen_output and dis_tar_output respectively. It has an encoder block and decoder block. Batch Normalization mainly reduces the internal covariate shift in a deep network. png Add onsThe modifications over the base Pix2PixGAN found in 1 are Batch Normalization Instance Normalization Spectral Normalization and Multi scale discriminators. Instance normalization normalizes each sample independently accross all spatial dimensions for each channel. And as stated by the authors of this paper a fraction of the images generated were desaturated. The SN involves dividing the weights of hidden layers by their spectral norms such that the Lipchitz Constant for each layer and the entire network is 1. And this takes a lot of time in training the deep network. So the discriminator that gets a smaller image checks for consistency with the target image. 128x128 64x64 and 32x32. Inputs are matrices due to generated colored image and target colored image ie. Architecture of the generator model Make tf. The contracting path tells WHAT ARE THE FEATURES IN THE IMAGE and the expanding path tells where these features are located in the image. The discriminator with larger input image can try to mimic finer details. The dataset can be found here https www. 2 layers and that of decoding path is TransposeConv BatchNorm ReLU layers. 2 Isola Phillip et al. al aim to mimic the color distribution by forcing the generated images to be indistinguishable from target images. AIMThe aim of this notebook is to generate coloured image given a grayscale image as input. 2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition CVPR 2017 5967 5976. It comprises of Conv BatchNorm LeakyReLU layers with added Spectral normalization 3 and instance normalization 5. The spectral norm is the maximum sigular value of matrix A. On the other hand the generator takes in the original grayscale image and outputs a coloured image. Overview of the dataset Visualizations Train test split Abstract 1 introduced a novel architecture over baseline Pix2Pix GAN model given in 2. Then we implement the training function where we use Gradient Tape to retrieve the gradients of trackable objects weights here with repect to loss function. Import the datasetThe number of images in both color and gray folders is 7129. ________________. png Multi Scale DiscriminatorsMulti scale discriminators were introduced in 4. png raw 1 The loss function is the sum of sigmoid cross entropy calculated b w output from the discriminator dis_gen_output and array of ones and L1 loss between target image target_image and generated image gen_output. Dis https brstar96. com max 728 1 JqbhYjs4yYieoAG1tjzkkA. However these methods suffer from desaturated results as observed in version 7. What is internal covariate shift The hidden layers in the network recieve different batches in each epoch to train on. Skip connections are used to transfer image content at different levels from encoding block to decoding block. 3 such patchGAN models will be used as discriminators and they will be fed images of different resolutions 4. Architecture of the discriminator model Modified U net Generator The modified U net is made up of d_block. However adding color to these images helps in distinguishing between real objects and their physical variations eg. To make the following constrain hold true the weight matrix is divided by its spectral norm. com max 3600 1 dJv LGnS0R_CyunOmrQBaA. This notebook takes inspiration from End to End Conditional GAN based Architectures for Image Colourisation by Marc Gorriz Blanch Marta Mrak Alan F. Model Training Model Prediction All models are saved Contracting path _______________________. What Batch Normalization does is that calculates the mean and variance for the entire mini batch of data accross all spatial dimensions for each channel and normalizes the distribution to have a zero mean and unit variance. Custom TrainingFirst we are going to make the appropriate tensorflow datsets then we declare the optimizer and checkpoint. First step is to sort the images in the same order. ___________________. jpeg This limits to how fast the gradients can change. Yoshida Spectral normalization for generative adversarial networks arXiv 1802. ResourcesMost of the work was done on base Pix2Pix network and additional ideas were introduced for better results. When comparing high resolution images a larger effective receptive field is needed to check for consistency accross the images. So now the distribution does not change dramatically speeding up the training process. ____________________. com theblackmamba31 landscape image colorization. First What is Lipchitz continuity and Lipchitz constant A function f R R is called Lipchitz continueous if the following holds true LC https miro. So the solution was to use three discriminators with same structure but feeding them images of different resolutions. Discriminator loss Dloss https github. These two elements can cause the change in the distribution of inputs on every epoch when being fed to a hidden layer prompting them to adjust to the new distribution. The reasoning was that the contrast of the generated image should only depend on the that of style image. mean and variance for the test dataset and not the statistics from training dataset in case you put training False. Then we can rescale them and pass them as numpy arrays. Original code by authors of the paper 1 can be found on Github https github.
