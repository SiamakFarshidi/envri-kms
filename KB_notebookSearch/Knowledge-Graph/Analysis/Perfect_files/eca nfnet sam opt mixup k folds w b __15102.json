We also find that mixup reduces the memorization of corrupt labels increases the robustness to adversarial examples and stabilizes the training of generative adversarial networks. Although recent work has succeeded in training deep ResNets without normalization layers these models do not match the test accuracies of the best batch normalized networks and are often unstable for large learning rates or strong data augmentations. png Custom Class for Monitoring Loss and ROCWeighted Random SamplerSamples elements from 0. Train and Valid LoaderECA NFNetBatch normalization is a key component of most image classification models but it has many undesirable properties stemming from its dependence on the batch size and interactions between examples. The smaller models match the test accuracy of an EfficientNet B7 on ImageNet while being up to 8. len weights 1 with given probabilities weights.

Another approach is to shuffle the dataset just once prior to splitting the dataset into k folds and then split such that the ratio of the observations in each class remains the same in each fold. Global Feature Descriptor2. Normalizer Free ResNets use an adaptive gradient clipping technique which overcomes these instabilities. In essence mixup trains a neural network on convex combinations of pairs of examples and their labels. The empirical results show that SAM improves model generalization across a variety of benchmark datasets e. Indeed optimizing only the training loss value as is commonly done can easily lead to suboptimal model quality. jpg We have seen in recent years that channel attention mechanism has demonstrated to offer great potential in improving the performance of deep convolutional neural networks CNNs. ECA block is also made up of 3 modules which include 1. com max 1838 0 CdJ256L9RTDGGLrS. It utilizes Efficient Channel Attention ECA instead of Squeeze Excitation. Every fold gets chance to appears in the training set k 1 times which in turn ensures that every observation in the dataset appears in the dataset thus enabling the model to learn the underlying data distribution better. We ll be using this to train our K Fold Cross Validation and gain better insights about our training. png Import LibrariesDefine Configurations ParametersDefine Seed for ReproducibilityDefine Train and TestMinimal EDA Code Credit Ertu\u011frul Demir The dataset is very imbalanced and we will see later how we use a sampler to handle it. Image AugmentationCustom DatasetMixUp AugmentationLarge deep neural networks are powerful but exhibit undesirable behaviors suchas memorization and sensitivity to adversarial examples. Experiments show that mixup improves the generalization of state of the art neural network architectures. 7x faster to train and the largest models attain a new state of the art top 1 accuracy of 86. png ECA NFNet model variant is slimmed down from the original F0 variant in the paper for improved runtime characteristics throughput memory use in PyTorch on a GPU accelerator. CIFAR 10 CIFAR 100 ImageNet finetuning tasks and models yielding novel state of the art performance for several. ECA Net takes an input tensor which is the output of a convolutional layer and is 4 dimensional of the shape B C H W where B represents the batch size C represents the number of channels or total number of feature maps in that tensor and finally H and W represent the spatial dimensions of each feature map namely the height and width. By dissectingthe channel attention module in SENet Squeeze and Excitation the paper empirically shows avoiding dimensionality reduction is important for learning channel attention and appropriate cross channel interaction can preserve performance while significantly decreasing model complexity. The output of ECA block is also a 4 D tensor of the same shape. Using timm we will create the ECA NFNet for our problem statement. com davda54 sam main img loss_landscape. It also features SiLU activations instead of the usual GELU. Additionally SAM natively provides robustness to label noise on par with that provided by state of the art procedures that specifically target learning with noisy labels. This parameter decides how many folds the dataset is going to be divided. Like other models in the NF family this model contains no normalization layers batch group etc. This approach is called Stratified K Fold CV. We will be using the ECA NFNET l0 which is a slimmed down from the original F0 variant. This approach is useful for imbalanced datasets. However most of the existing methods dedicated to developing more sophisticated attention modules for achieving betterperformance are inevitably increasing model complexity. png Define Loss Function Optimizer and SchedulerTrain and Validation LoopsBig Shoutout to nakshatrasingh for pointing out the missing Mixup implementationW B Initialization for K FOLD CVK Fold CV gives a model with less bias compared to other methods. Efficient Channel Attention for Normalizer Free Networks https blog. We will use their tools to log hyperparameters and output metrics from your runs then visualize and compare results and quickly share findings with your colleagues. Furthermore a method to adaptively select kernel size of 1D convolution determining coverage of local cross channel interaction has been developed ECA Net s architecture is extremely similar to that of SE Net as shown in the above figure. Cross Validation ResultsWe are able to achieve a Validation ROC score of. com max 910 1 CjpipU_oChc899f_Esjpyg. To overcome the performance and complexity trade off this paper proposes an Efficient Channel Attention ECA module which only involves a handful of parameters while bringing clear performance gain. Adaptive Neighborhood Interaction3. Broadcasted ScalingWhat are we discussing today Normalizer Free Networks with ECA Sam Optimizer with AdamP Mixup Augmentation Weighted Random Sampler K Fold Cross Validation Weights and Biases for Experiment TrackingUpvote the kernel if you find it insightful TIMM Pytorch ModelsPyTorch Image Models timm is a collection of image models layers utilities optimizers schedulers data loaders augmentations and reference training validation scripts that aim to pull together a wide variety of SOTA models with ability to reproduce ImageNet training results. In addition Normalizer Free models attain significantly better performance than their batch normalized counterparts when finetuning on ImageNet after large scale pre training on a dataset of 300 million labeled images with our best models obtaining an accuracy of 89. Also the test set does not overlap between consecutive iterations. com content images size w1600 2020 09 eca_module. Sharpness Aware Minimization SAM OptimizerIn today s heavily overparameterized models the value of the training loss provides few guarantees on model generalization ability. MixUp is a data augmentation technique to alleviate these issues. Therefore a local crosschannel interaction strategy without dimensionality reduction is proposed which can be efficiently implemented via 1D convolution. Sharpness Aware Minimization SAM seeks parameters that lie in neighborhoods having uniformly low loss this formulation results in a min max optimization problem on which gradient descent can be performed efficiently. By doing so mixup regularizes the neural network to favor simple linear behaviorin between training examples. The models make use of Weight Standardized convolutions with additional scaling values in lieu of normalization layers.
