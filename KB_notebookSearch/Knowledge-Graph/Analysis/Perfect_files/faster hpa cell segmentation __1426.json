About This CodeThe following code writes the code to a Python file and starts it in a separate process to simplify memory management. In order to properly post process the resized image I have adjusted some parameters in the post processing code to 0. By default the NN model of HPA Cell Segmentation processes 0. For parameters related to area I adjusted them by a factor of 1 16. The output of each mask by naive HPA Cell Segmentation for comparison is temp test_mask_original ID _cell. to experiment with a small amount of data during debugging. The output of each mask by HPA Cell Segmentation is temp test_mask ID _cell. npy temp test_mask_original ID _nuc. The input to be processed is. Tuned for segmentation hpa images exclude the green area first this part is to use green channel and extend cell label to green channel benefit is to exclude cells clear on border but without nucleus cell_image cv2. resize cell_image 512 512 ax i. Setup Faster HPA Cell Segmentation Code Run and Execution Time Original Code Run and Execution Time Comparing Images Faster HPA Cell Segmentation Overlay Original Overlay Faster HPA Cell Segmentation Mask Only Original Mask Only a bytes object dt for hpa_image to remove the small pseduo nuclei this is to remove the cell borders signal from cell mask. Faseter HPA Cell SegmentationThe execution time of HPA Cell Segmentation seems to use a lot of time for post processing. Therefore I applied post processing to the resized image 512x512 to achieve the speed up. logical_and with some revision to replace this func. Therefore it is inefficient to perform post processing on the restored image 2048x2048. npy temp test_mask ID _nuc.
