Additionally we find that SAM natively provides robustness to label noise on par with that provided by state of the art procedures that specifically target learning with noisy labels. 7 top 1 accuracy on the ImageNet benchmark while being up to 2. Because of the scale invariance this modification only alters the effective step sizes without changing the effective update directions thus enjoying the original convergence properties of GD optimizers.

We verify that our solution brings about uniform gains in those benchmarks. Given the ubiquity of momentum GD and scale invariance in machine learning we have evaluated our methods against the baselines on 13 benchmarks. Indeed optimizing only the training loss value as is commonly done can easily lead to suboptimal model quality. 7 Box AP on the COCO Instance Segmentation benchmark using the Mask R CNN framework surpassing the previous best published single model and single scale results of ResNeSt evaluated on the COCO validation set. We propose a simple and effective remedy SGDP and AdamP get rid of the radial component or the norm increasing direction at each optimizer step. Through the design of BoTNet we also point out how ResNet bottleneck blocks with self attention can be viewed as Transformer blocks. WikiText and audio classification e.

Finally we present a simple adaptation of the BoTNet design for image classification resulting in models that achieve a strong performance of 84. It is often overlooked however that the additional introduction of momentum in GD optimizers results in a far more rapid reduction in effective step sizes for scale invariant weights a phenomenon that has not yet been studied and may have caused unwanted side effects in the current practice. io badge Upvote If 20you 20like 20my 20work 07b3c8 style for the badge logo kaggle When running on the CuDNN backend two further options must be set Set a fixed value for the hash seed Each epoch has a training and validation phase Set model to training mode Set model to evaluation mode Iterate over data forward track history if only in train use this loss for any training statistics backward optimize only if in training phase first forward backward pass second forward backward pass deep copy the model load best model weights climb to the local maximum w e w get back to w from w e w do the actual sharpness aware update the closure should do a full forward backward pass put everything on the same device in case of model parallelism recurse channels in feature map size channels out projection factor downsample on first layer or not number of heads dimension per head defaults to 128 use relative positional embedding uses absolute if False activation throughout the network channels in feature map size channels out projection factor downsample on first layer or not number of heads dimension per head defaults to 128 use relative positional embedding uses absolute if False activation throughout the network channels in feature map size channels out projection factor downsample on first layer or not number of heads dimension per head defaults to 128 use relative positional embedding uses absolute if False activation throughout the network convert ReLU activation to SiLU. This is a crucial issue because arguably the vast majority of modern deep neural networks consist of 1 momentum based GD e. We present empirical results showing that SAM improves model generalization across a variety of benchmark datasets e. They let weights converge more quickly with often better generalization performances. They range from vision tasks like classification e. COCO to language modelling e. Motivated by the connection between geometry of the loss landscape and generalization including a generalization bound that we prove here we introduce a novel effective procedure for instead simultaneously minimizing loss value and loss sharpness. In this paper we verify that the widely adopted combination of the two ingredients lead to the premature decay of effective step sizes and sub optimal model performances. CUB and SOP and detection e.

We hope our simple and effective approach will serve as a strong baseline for future research in self attention models for vision. By just replacing the spatial convolutions with global self attention in the final three bottleneck blocks of a ResNet and no other changes our approach improves upon the baselines significantly on instance segmentation and object detection while also reducing the parameters with minimal overhead in latency. Without any bells and whistles BoTNet achieves 44. Meet the New SeresnextWith ATTENTION We present BoTNet a conceptually simple yet powerful backbone architecture that incorporates self attention for multiple computer vision tasks including image classification object detection and instance segmentation. Sharpness Aware Minimization for Efficiently ImprovingGeneralization https arxiv. 08217 https camo. In particular our procedure Sharpness Aware Minimization SAM seeks parameters that lie in neighborhoods having uniformly low loss this formulation results in a min max optimization problem on which gradient descent can be performed efficiently. com 8fd97868a8075b4ce9d6f99404fef38d8aa71ee1db465744905ce972152af9cc 68747470733a2f2f636c6f766161692e6769746875622e696f2f4164616d502f7374617469632f696d672f70726f6a656374696f6e2e737667 Run Fold 0Visualize Training Validation MetricsTraining Loss vs Validation LossTraining Accuracy vs Validation Accuracy Upvote https img. 11605 https user images. 33x faster in compute time than the popular EfficientNet models on TPU v3 hardware.
