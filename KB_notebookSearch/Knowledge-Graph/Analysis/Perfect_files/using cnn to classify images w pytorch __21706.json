The convolution operation brings a solution to the problem arising from the presence of a huge number of input data i. DescriptionThis dataset contains 6 899 images from 8 distinct classes compiled from various sources see Acknowledgements. org wiki Backpropagation 5 https becominghuman. Fully Connected Layers4. The backpropagation algorithm works by computing the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight by the chain rule iterating backwards one layer at a time from the last layer to avoid redundant calculations of intermediate terms in the chain rule this is an example of dynamic programming. The essence of overfitting is to have unknowingly extracted some of the residual variation i. An artificial neuron that receives a signal then processes it and can signal neurons connected to it. Dog images obtained from https www. random_split for training test split define a loader for the training data we can iterate through in 50 image batches define a loader for the testing data we can iterate through in 50 image batches Recall that we have resized the images and saved them into Get the iterative dataloaders for test and training data Create a neural net class Defining the Constructor In the init function we define each layer we will use in our model Our images are RGB so we have input channels 3. The basic transformations available are1. Pooling layers reduce the dimensions of the data by combining the outputs of neuron clusters at one layer into a single neuron in the next layer. Define the model as a sequential layers2. 3 1 https arxiv. An overfitted model is a statistical model that contains more parameters than can be justified by the data. Neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds. Nornalization Layerswhere 2 3 4 are hidden layers. 2 To recap a CNN have1. For example if our CNN have three possibile classes C_1 C_2 C_3 and e. png Convolutional Layers When programming a CNN the input is a tensor with shape number of images image width image height image depth. Airplane images obtained from http host. Let s take a closer look at how it works. The input area of a neuron is called its receptive field. ImageFolder https pytorch. Backpropagation efficiently computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights of the network for a single input output example. 6 b https upload. Using Convolutional Neural Networks CNN to classify ImagesWe will use the PyTorch https pytorch. Data AugmentationOne way to mitigate the overfitting problem is to perform data augmentation by making random transformations of the training images for example by flipping rotating or cropping the images. org docs stable torchvision datasets. We will apply 12 filters in the first convolutional layer A second convolutional layer takes 12 input channels and generates 24 outputs We in the end apply max pooling with a kernel size of 2 A drop layer deletes 20 of the features to help prevent overfitting Our 128x128 image tensors will be pooled twice with a kernel size of 2. WeightsEach neuron in a neural network computes an output value by applying a specific function to the input values coming from the receptive field in the previous layer e. The source code is publicly available on GitHub. com images Perceptron_bkp_1. The transformations are done using torchvision. Introduce the Poolings MaxPooling is used to reduce dimensionality. org wiki Convolutional_neural_network 3 https en. The degree to which we adjust the weights is determined by the learning rate the larger the learning rate the bigger the adjustments made to the weights. join dirname filename Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output. Motorbike images obtained from http host. Calculate the accuracy for this batch3. This is done to prevent overfitting. During the forward pass each filter is convolved across the width and height of the input volume computing the dot product between the entries of the filter and the input and producing a 2 dimensional activation map of that filter. org wikipedia commons e e9 Max_pooling.

Calculate the loss for the batch 3. 012 when the actual observation label is 1 would be bad and result in a high loss value. The connections are called edges. Calculate the average accuracy and loss for the epoch Training the Model Adam optimizerWhen training the Model we use the ADAM optimizer 1 2 that is an adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm that s been designed specifically for training deep neural networks. Stacking the activation maps for all filters along the depth dimension forms the full output volume of the convolution layer. Then after passing through a convolutional layer the image becomes abstracted to a feature map with shape number of images feature map width feature map height feature map channels. com blog research pubfig83 lfw dataset 1 https www. Typically the subarea is of a square shape e. Max pooling uses the maximum value from each of a cluster of neurons at the prior layer. This makes it feasible to use gradient methods for training multi layer networks updating weights to minimize loss commonly one uses gradient descent or variants such as stochastic gradient descent. If the validation error increases positive slope while the training error steadily decreases negative slope then a situation of overfitting may have occurred. org wiki Overfitting 7 https machinelearningmastery. com dropout for regularizing deep neural networks a https en. A NN is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. svg In the image above training error is shown in blue validation error in red both as a function of the number of training epochs. It uses the squared gradients to scale the learning rate like RMSprop and it takes advantage of momentum by using moving average of the gradient instead of gradient itself like SGD with momentum. The backpropagation algorithm consists of two phases the forward phase where the activations are propagated from the input to the output layer and the backward phase where the error between the observed actual and the requested nominal value in the output layer is propagated backwards in order to modify the weights and bias values. org docs stable _modules torch nn modules module. Set the model to evaluation mode 2. Neurons may have a threshold such that a signal is sent only if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. html View Loss History Evaluate the ModelWe can see that there is a huge mislassification among dog and cats. We will also use a separate set of test images to test the model at the end of each epoch so we can track the performance improvement as the training process progresses. Process the images in batches we will iterate over images in batches. The function that is applied to the input values is determined by a vector of weights and a bias typically real numbers. A distinguishing feature of CNNs is that many neurons can share the same filter. When we train a CNN we perform mulitple passes forward through the network of layers and then use a loss function to measure the difference between the output values which you may recall are probability predictions for each class and the actual values for the known image classes used to train the model in other words 1 for the correct class and 0 for all the others. RandomVerticalFlip p 0. Adam can be looked at as a combination of RMSprop and Stochastic Gradient Descent with momentum. The most famous example of the inability of perceptron to solve problems with linearly non separable cases is the XOR problem. 3333333333333333 interpolation 2 Crop the given PIL Image to random size and aspect ratio. org 2 https pytorch.

The layer s parameters consist of a set of learnable filters or kernels which have a small receptive field but extend through the full depth of the input volume. com artificial_neural_network_bkp. A multi layer perceptron MLP has the same structure of a single layer perceptron with one or more hidden layers. Different layers may perform different transformations on their inputs. We then go backwards through the network adjusting the weights before the next forward pass. jpg In ANN implementations the signal at a connection is a real number and the output of each neuron is computed by some non linear function of the sum of its inputs. Randomly dropping some of these feature maps helps vary the features that are extracted in each batch ensuring the model doesn t become overly reliant on any one dominant feature in the training data. com uploads articles how to perform classification using a neural network a simple perceptron example_rk_aac_image2. This means that our feature tensors are now 32 x 32 and we ve generated 24 of them We need to flatten these in order to feed them to a fully connected layer In the forward function pass the data through the layers we defined in the init function Use a ReLU activation function after layer 1 convolution 1 and pool Use a ReLU activation function after layer 2 Select some features to drop to prevent overfitting only drop during training Flatten Feed to fully connected layer to predict class Return class probabilities via a log_softmax function if GPU available use cuda on a cpu training will take a considerable length of time Create an instance of the model class and allocate it to the device Set the model to training mode Process the images in batches Use the CPU or GPU as appropriate Recall that GPU is optimized for the operations we are dealing with Reset the optimizer Push the data forward through the model layers Get the loss Keep a running total Backpropagate Print metrics so we see some progress return average loss for the epoch Switch the model to evaluation mode so we don t backpropagate or drop Get the predicted classes for this batch Calculate the loss for this batch Calculate the accuracy for this batch Calculate the average loss and total accuracy for this epoch return average loss for the epoch Use an Adam optimizer to adjust weights Specify the loss criteria Track metrics in these arrays Train over 10 epochs We restrict to 10 for time issues Defining Labels and Predictions Plot the confusion matrix. RandomHorizontalFlip p 0. The final convolution in turn often involves backpropagation in order to more accurately weight the end product. html Defining the Convolutional Neural NetworkIn PyTorch you define a neural network model as a class that is derived from the nn. The basic example is the perceptron a. RandomRotation degrees resample False expand False center None fill 0 4. We have a huge amount of images with different sizes and shapes. For more on optimizers in PyTorch see 1 Notice that we have a layer that randomly drops 20 of the features to prevent overfitting. Your class must define the layers in the network and provide a forward method that is used to process data through the layers of the network. Push the data forward through the layers of the model 4. Pooling Convolutional networks may include local or global pooling layers to streamline the underlying computation. Counteracting Overfitting Data Augmentation and Drop Layers OverfittingIn statistics overfitting is the production of an analysis that corresponds too closely or exactly to a particular set of data and may therefore fail to fit additional data or predict future observations reliably. Backpropagation Backpropagation is an algorithm widely used in the training of feedforward neural networks for supervised learning generalizations exist for other artificial neural networks ANNs and for functions generally. Inside each batches we have to 1. Compute the Average Loss of the Model during the EpochWe will thus calling eath once per epoch. The flattened matrix goes through a fully connected layer to classify the images. As a result the network learns filters that activate when it detects some specific type of feature at some spatial position in the input. Receptive FieldsIn neural networks each neuron receives input from some number of locations in the previous layer. A somewhat unexpected classification error is the superposition of Flowers upon Dog Cats instead of fruits that are well classified Here we insert a code to cancel the images we have resized and saved into the.

The loaders will transform the image data into tensors which are the core data structure used in PyTorch and normalize them so that the pixel values are in a scale with a mean of 0. Convolutional layers convolve the input and pass its result to the next layer. Its name is derived from adaptive moment estimation and the reason it s called that is because Adam uses estimations of first and second moments of gradient to adapt the learning rate for each weight of the neural network. Loss CriteriaAs a loss criteria we use the Cross Entropy Loss log loss that measures the performance of a classification model whose output is a probability value between 0 and 1. com prasunroy natural images 2 https en. org docs stable optim.

A Basics of Artificial Neural Networks Artificial neural networks ANN or NN are computing systems that are inspired by but not identical to biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. Signals travel from the first layer the input layer to the last layer the output layer possibly after traversing the layers multiple times. Every entry in the output volume can thus also be interpreted as an output of a neuron that looks at a small region in the input and shares parameters with neurons in the same activation map. The classes include airplane car cat dog flower fruit motorbike and person. the number of pixels as it reduces the number of free parameters allowing the network to be deeper with fewer parameters. The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. The activation function is commonly a REctified Linear Unit RELU layer and is subsequently followed by additional convolutions such as pooling layers fully connected layers and normalization layers referred to as hidden layers because their inputs and outputs are masked by the activation function and final convolution. The vector of weights and the bias are called filters and represent particular features of the input e. Person images obtained from http www. In MaxPooling the output value is just the maximum of the input values in each patch for ex. Learning in a neural network progresses by making iterative adjustments to these biases and weights.
