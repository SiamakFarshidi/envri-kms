In practice loading all the taining image arrays are too heavy to be loaded on memory so these are loaded inside DataLoader on demand This is done by mapper class in detectron2 as I will expain later. com corochann vinbigdata detectron2 prediction kernel explains how to use trained model for the prediction and submisssion for this competition. These models are summarized in MODEL_ZOO. detectron2 is one of the famous pytorch object detection library https github. You just need to wrap above training scripts by main method and use launch method provided by detectron2. OUTPUT_DIR str outdir print f cfg. This dataset_dicts contains the metadata for actual data fed into the neural network. OUTPUT_DIR original_output_dir cfg. Since mapper is used inside DataLoader we can check its behavior by constucting DataLoader and visualize the data processed by the DataLoader. Visualization of augmentation by MapperLet s check the behavior of Mapper method. import matplotlib. It affects to the score a lot Preferable radiologist s id in the test dataset https www. There are really many That s all I found that the competition data is not so many 15000 for all images 4000 images after filtering No finding images. 0 is used in this kaggle docker image. com facebookresearch detectron2 blob master configs COCO Detection faster_rcnn_R_50_FPN_3x. Please refer official example train_net. get_checkpoint_url config_name cfg. aug_kwargs pass aug_kwargs to cfg original_output_dir cfg. It is loaded beforehand of the training on memory so it should contain all the metadata image filepath etc to construct training dataset but should not contain heavy data. width width of the image. height height of the image.

I insert LossEvalHook before evalutor to work well. com c vinbigdata chest xray abnormalities detection discussion 219672 The 1 step pipeline which does not use any 2 class classifier approach is proposed. We can analyze plot them to check how the training proceeded. image_id id of the image index is used here. draw_dataset_dict per_image. Here I will just use the dataset VinBigData Chest X ray Resized PNG 256x256 https www. Training method implementationsBasically we don t need to implement neural network part detectron2 already implements famous architectures and provides its pre trained weights. In my experiment Calcification seems to be the most difficult class to predict. TEST else cfg. NUM_CLASSES len thing_classes os. We need object detection model We choosen R50 FPN https github. com facebookresearch detectron2 blob master tools train_net. Then I noticed that we can use many augmentations in albumentations so I implemented AlbumentationsMapper to support it. It does not take long time to train less than a day so this competition may be a good choice for beginners who want to learn object detection If this kernel helps you please upvote to keep me motivated Thanks Next step VinBigData detectron2 prediction https www. Note that both detectron2. TRAIN vinbigdata_train if split_mode all_train cfg. I also uploaded the original sized png images vinbigdata chest xray original png https www. Now the methods are ready. out visualizer. com facebookresearch detectron2 blob master MODEL_ZOO. CHECKPOINT_PERIOD 100000 Small value Frequent save need a lot of storage. To define custom dataset we need to create list of dict dataset_dicts where each dict contains following file_name file name of the image. pyplot as plt Ref https github. Here implemented VinbigdataEvaluator is constructed we can also use COCOEvaluator here. merge_from_file model_zoo. com xhlulu vinbigdata chest xray resized png 256x256 to skip the preprocessing and focus on modeling part. We can finetune these pre trained architectures. You can check that augmentation is applied and every time the image looks different. BATCH_SIZE_PER_IMAGE flags. We can construct train_loader purely from cfg without instantiating trainer since it s class method. Visualize loss curve competition metric AP40As I explained the calculated metrics are saved in metrics. TrainingIt s actually very easy to use multiple gpus for training. get_config_file config_name cfg. Our Evaluator calculaes AP by class and it is easy to check which class is diffucult to train.

It provides Visualizer class we can use it to draw an image with bounding box as following.

The defined Trainer class has class method build_train_loader. inputdir Path kaggle input datadir inputdir floor plans for mta image processing course utils configs Visualize data. Now all the preparation has done MyTrainer overwraps build_evaluator method of DefaultTrainer provided by detectron2 to support validation dataset evaluation. How many augmentations can be used in albumentations You can see official github page all Pixel level transforms https github. base_lr pick a good LR cfg.

Thus bounding box is adjusted when the image is scaled rotated etc At first I was using detectron2. annotation This is the ground truth annotation data for object detection which contains following bbox bounding box pixel location with shape n_boxes 4 bbox_mode BoxMode.
