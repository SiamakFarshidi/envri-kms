They used different scanners with slightly different maximum microscope resolutions and worked with different pathologists for labeling their images. Both the Karolinska Institute and Radboud University Medical Center contributed data. PANDA EDA All you need to know https www. The label information is stored in the red R channel the other channels are set to zero and can be ignored. This is a challenging area of pathology and even experts in the field with years of experience do not always agree on how to interpret a slide. An alternate cancer severity rating system with more levels than the ISUP scale. These masks are provided to assist with the development of strategies for selecting the most useful subsamples of the images. For details on how the gleason and ISUP systems compare see the Additional Resources tab https admin. Getting started with the PANDA dataset https www. Intermediate levels can be created by downsampling a higher resolution level. Using OpenSlide to load the dataIn the following section we will load data from the slides with OpenSlide https openslide. Note that eventhough a biopsy contains cancer not all epithelial tissue has to be cancerous. The severity of the cancer on a 0 5 scale. Biopsies can contain a mix of cancerous and healthy tissue. Please upvote this kernel if you like it. Some things you can notice The image dimensions are quite large typically between 5. Note that slightly different procedures were in place for the images used in the test set than the training set. Prostate cANcer graDe Assessment PANDA Challenge Prostate cancer diagnosis using the Gleason grading system Introduction Welcome to the Prostate cANcer graDe Assessment PANDA Challenge competition In this competition contestants are challenge to classify the severity of prostate cancer from microscopy scans of prostate biopsy samples. Observation we can observe those are in different dimensions with different levels with down sampling Loading image regions patchesWith OpenSlide we can easily extract patches from the slide from arbitrary locations. This will make training models more difficult but increases the potential medical value of having a strong model to provide consistent ratings. Loading a specific region is done using the read_region function. This labels are imperfect. This rotation has no clinical value and is only dependent on how the biopsy was collected in the lab. To more easily inspect the masks we map the int labels to RGB colors using a color palette. com watch v eTN2vXpSHd8 The Dataset image_id ID code for the image. Valid values 0 background non tissue or unknown 1 benign tissue stroma and epithelium combined 2 cancerous tissue stroma and epithelium combined The label masks of Radboudumc were semi automatically generated by several deep learning algorithms contain noise and can be considered as weakly supervised labels. The mask values depend on the data provider Radboud Prostate glands are individually labelled. we created a small function to show some basic information about a slide. org api python Loading a slideBefore we can load from a slide we need to open it. You can find additional details about how consistently the pathologist s labels matched here https zenodo. Not all training images have label masks and there may be false positives or false negatives in the label masks for a variety of reasons. If you prefer something like matplotlib you can also use plt. All of the private test set images and most of the public test set images were graded by multiple pathologists but this was not feasible for the training set. com c prostate cancer grade assessment overview additional resources. 4f total_loss i 1 if i 1 break qwk optimize coefficients. Visualizing masks using matplotlib Given that the masks are just integer matrices you can also use other packages to display the masks. Running the cell below loads four example biopsies using OpenSlide. Print the case level label Generate a small image thumbnail Read in the mask data from the highest level We cannot use thumbnail here because we need to load the raw label data. com articles s41746 019 0112 2 4. There are two unusual twists to this problem relative to most competitions Each individual image is quite large. Development and validation of a deep learning algorithm for improving Gleason scoring of prostate cancer https www. csv and sample_submission. For example using matplotlib and a custom color map we can quickly visualize the different cancer regions Modeling quadratic_weighted_kappa Please upvote if you like it. Using the level argument we can easily load in data from any level that is present in the slide. Biopsies can be in different rotations. Valid values are 0 background non tissue or unknown 1 stroma connective tissue non epithelium tissue 2 healthy benign epithelium 3 cancerous epithelium Gleason 3 4 cancerous epithelium Gleason 4 5 cancerous epithelium Gleason 5 Karolinska Regions are labelled. The full versions will be available to your submitted notebooks. Mask data is present in the R channel To show the masks we map the raw label values to RGB values Mapping 0 background 1 stroma 2 benign epithelium 3 Gleason 3 4 Gleason 4 5 Gleason 5 Mapping 0 background 1 benign 2 cancer Compute microns per pixel openslide gives resolution in centimeters Optional create a custom color map if i int t 10 0 print f Epoch epoch 1 i Loss. imshow to directly show a mask without converting it to an RGB image. Each slide has 3 levels you can load corresponding to a downsampling of 1 4 and 16. Visualizing the masks using PIL Using a small helper function we can display some basic information about a mask. 000 pixels in both x and y. These masks directly indicate which parts of the tissue are healthy and which are cancerous. You can read more about the OpenSlide python bindings in the documentation https openslide. Loading label masksApart from the slide level label present in the csv file almost all slides in the training set have an associated mask with additional label information. The first mask is from Radboudumc and shows two different grades of cancer shown in yellow and orange. The second mask is from Karolinska the region that contains cancer is higlighted in red. We re excited to see what strategies you come up with for efficiently locating areas of concern to zoom in on. Additionally this function display a small thumbnail of the slide. This is a notebooks only competition the downloadable test. gleason_score Train only. Each is a large multi level tiff file. Load the data Train data Observation Different providers have different target distributions. The benefit of OpenSlide is that we can load arbitrary regions of the slide with out loading the whole image in memory. As with the slides itself the label masks can be opened using OpenSlide. Coordinates passed to read_region are always relative to level 0 the highest resolution. isup_grade Train only. EDANow I will try to visualize the sales data and gain some insights from it. The label masks of Karolinska were semi autotomatically generated based on annotations by a pathologist. The cells below shows two example masks from the dataset. It motivates me To get started we need to understand Prostate Cancer hear is an excellent video about Prostate Cancer Acknowledgements1. csv have been truncated. train test _images The images. The information in the masks differ from the two centers Radboudumc Prostate glands are individually labelled. All images in the dataset contain this metadata and you can use this in your data pipeline. com wouterbulten getting started with the panda dataset by Wouter Bulten and team2. Some of the training set images have stray pen marks on them but the test set slides are free of pen marks. do somethiing with the slide hear Generate a small image thumbnail Here we compute the Pixel spacing the physical size of a pixel in the image. com dhananjay3 panda eda all you need to know by Dhananjay Raut3. OpenSlide gives the resolution in centimeters so we convert this to microns. The label masks are stored in an RGB format so that they can be easily opened by image readers. And finaly I will demonstrate how this problem can be approched with a variety of image classification models. Then I will visualize the dataset using Plotly and Matplotlib. data_provider The name of the institution that provided the data. In this kernel I will briefly explain the structure of dataset. There are noticable color differences between the biopsies this is very common within pathology and is caused by different laboratory procedures. Valid values are 1 background non tissue or unknown 2 benign tissue stroma and epithelium combined 3 cancerous tissue stroma and epithelium combined sample_submission. You can expect roughly 1 000 images in the hidden test set. Prostate Cancer Research Institute https www. After a file in open we can retrieve data from it at arbitratry positions and levels. After opening the slide we can for example load a 512x512 patch from the lowest level level 0 at a specific coordinate. The dimensions of each level differ based on the dimensions of the original image.
