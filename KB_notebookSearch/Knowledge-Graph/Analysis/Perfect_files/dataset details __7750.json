One component of this overarching goal is to identify medically relevant functional tissue units FTUs within whole slide microscopy images of human tissues. Dataset Data Origin Tissue Mapping Center TMC Vanderbilt University VU The kidney images and their segmentation masks both of anatomical structures and glomeruli were generated by HuBMAP s tissue mapping center at Vanderbilt University TMC VU team at the BIOmolecular Multimodal Imaging Center BIOMIC https medschool. One nucleus spherical in shape per cell containing the genetic material for a cell its chromosomes composed of nucleic acids is stained dark bluish purple in the PAS stained images. Glomeruli Segmentation MasksThe glomeruli segmentation masks are a mix of manually and deep learning DL generated annotations in a slightly modified geoJSON https geojson. The magenta stained regions in PAS stained tissue are the stained polysaccharides. Any annotations of glomeruli that were considered incorrect ambiguous or originating from damaged portions of the images were removed. The resulting aldehydes react with the Schiff reagent to produce the purple magenta color exhibited by these images. Each item in the JSON list is an annotation with the following pertinent fields geometry geometry type All are Polygon geometry coordinates A list of each polygon vertex in x y order properties properties classification properties classification name Annotation class in this case all are Glomerulus properties measurements list of key value pairs for some quantitative property of the annotation. Glomeruli consist of capillaries that facilitate filtration of waste products out of blood. Fresh Frozen vs. PAS stains polysaccharides complex sugars like glycogen such as those found in and around the glomeruli making it a favored stain for delineating them in tissue sections Agarwal 2013 https doi. Refer to Figure 1 for a zoom sequence from the human body to single cell level for kidney. The position and shape of a glomeruli is represented by a set of coordinates see sample below in Figure 4. org article S2468 0249 19 30155 X abstract. Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded FFPE Tissue PreservationDifferent types of tissue preservation techniques are used to maintain the integrity of tissue for downstream biomolecular assays analysis. edu browse sice cns courses hubmap visible human mooc. Dataset Specifications 20 kidney tissue sections 11 fresh frozen FF carboxymethylcellulose CMC embedded 9 formalin fixed paraffin embedded FFPE Each sample has the following data PAS stain microscopy image RGB channel TIFF The histology stained image is saved as a 24 bit RGB. Normal glomeruli typically range from 100 350 \u03bcm in diameter with a roughly spherical shape Kannan 2019 https www. The spatial resolution is. Total dataset size approximately 80GB PAS stain microscopy images are 2. Fresh frozen tissue is frozen in liquid nitrogen 190 C within 30 60 minutes after surgical excision this type of preservation has been the method of choice for transcriptomics and immunohistochemistry tissue samples are often embedded in Optimal Cutting Temperature OCT media for thin sectioning Robbe 2018 https doi. See Figure 2 for an example of a PAS stain kidney slide image with a cyan overlay marking cortex area. FTUs and Glomeruli in KidneyBernard de Bono and his team coined the term functional tissue unit in 2013 as. The JavaScript Object Notation JSON file lists all glomeruli identified for each of the 11 9 tissue sections. Anatomical Structure segmentation mask JSON Glomeruli segmentation mask JSON Known clinical metadata includes Patient Number Race Ethnicity Sex Age Weight kilograms Height centimeters BMI body mass index kg m2 Laterality Percent Cortex Percent Medulla Global GS Count consecutive 100 glomeruli across cortex Global glomerulosclerosis GS definition The global glomerulosclerosis GS extent was defined as the number of globally sclerotic glomeruli the total number of available glomeruli 100. 241 or carboxymethylcellulose CMC for imaging mass spectrometry Stoeckli 2007 https doi. The detection_score present only in the DL generated annotations is a measure the DL model used during detection. Figure 3 is a light microscopy image that contains a glomerulus from a subsection of human kidney tissue stained with a PAS. Periodic acid is used to break specific bonds within these sugars. Glomeruli can be observed as the circular areas of dark stain. The periodic acid oxidizes the sugars to expose aldehyde free tips of the broken monosaccharide rings that react with the Schiff reagent to give a magenta color. org format which were made in QuPath Bankhead 2017 https doi. Once these FTUs are detected information on size shape variability in number and location within the tissue samples can be used to help build a spatially accurate and semantically explicit model of the human body. The glomeruli masks were further improved to provide a gold standard by the Indiana University team through a combination of manual and machine learning efforts. 1038 s41598 017 17204 5 and reviewed by subject matter experts SMEs for quality control. The HuBMAP Glomeruli FTU Segmentation Dataset by Leah Scherschel Ellen M Quardokus Yingnan Yu and Katy B\u00f6rner Indiana University Background Information Human Biomolecular Atlas Program HuBMAP HuBMAP aims to create an open global atlas of the human body at the cellular level see the HuBMAP Consortium https hubmapconsortium. Periodic acid Schiff PAS Stain MicroscopyPAS is a histology stain that detects complex sugars in tissue sections. Formalin fixed paraffin embedded FFPE tissue is the preferred method for clinical pathology samples for histology assessment since the formalin aldehyde cross links proteins to maintain structural integrity of the sample Bass 2014 https doi. org about and Visible Human Massive Open Online Course VHMOOC https expand. gov pubmed 24103658 One example of an FTU is the glomerulus found in the outer layer of kidney tissue known as the cortex which in humans has an area of about 800 mm2 and average depth of about 9 mm Mounier Vehier 2002 https doi. Glomeruli contain four cell types Parietal epithelial cells that form Bowman s capsule podocytes cover the outer layer of the filtration barrier fenestrated endothelial cells that are coated with a glycolipid and glycoprotein matrix called glycocalyx that are in direct contact with blood and mesangial cells that occupy the space between the capillary blood vessel loops and are stained by the colorimetric histological stain called Periodic acid Schiff PAS stain Vaughan 2008 https doi. a three dimensional block of cells centered around a capillary such that each cell in this block is within diffusion distance from any other cell in the same block de Bono 2013 https www. For annotations generated by the DL model this includes detection_score.
