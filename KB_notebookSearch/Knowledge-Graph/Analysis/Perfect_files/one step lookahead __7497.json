It is just one of many heuristics that works reasonably well for creating a Connect Four agent and you may find that you can design a heuristic that works much better In general if you re not sure how to design your heuristic i. _This is the same line of code we used in the previous tutorial _Next we convert the game board to a 2D numpy array. For each potential move you predict what your opponent is likely to do in response along with how you d then respond and what the opponent is likely to do then and so on. Note For this course we decided to provide relatively slower code that was easier to follow. This function uses the count_windows function which counts the number of windows of four adjacent locations in a row column or diagonal that satisfy specific conditions from the heuristic. Specifically count_windows grid num_discs piece config yields the number of windows in the game board grid that contain num_discs pieces from the player agent or opponent with mark piece and where the remaining locations in the window are empty. We use the get_win_percentage function from the previous tutorial to check how we can expect it to perform on average. For Connect Four grid is an array with 6 rows and 7 columns. And how exactly will the agent use the heuristic Consider it s the agent s turn and it s trying to plan a move for the game board shown at the top of the figure below. _The game tree for Connect Four is quite large so we show only a small preview in the image above_. Next we record each move the opponent yellow player can make in response and so on until each branch reaches the end of the game. com kernels fork 8139646. You will design the heuristic based on your knowledge of the game. This agent performs much better than the random agent Your turnContinue to the exercise to improve the heuristic https www. Each occurrence modifies the score. setting num_discs 3 and piece obs. HeuristicsThe complete game tree for Connect Four has over 4 trillion https oeis. org A212693 different boards So in practice our agent only works with a small subset when planning a move. _ One step lookahead refers to the fact that the agent looks only one step or move into the future instead of deeper in the game tree. After you ve taken the time to understand the code above can you see how to re write it to make it run much faster As a hint note that the count_windows function is used several times to loop over the locations in the game board. Then you choose the move that you think is most likely to result in a win. For each move we record the resulting game board. Then the score_move function calculates the value of the heuristic for each valid move. _If multiple moves get the high score we select one at random. To do this we search the grid and look for all occurrences of the pattern in the heuristic similar to a word search https en. In the next code cell we see the outcome of one game round against a random agent. We can formalize this idea and represent all possible outcomes in a complete game tree. Once we can see every way the game can possibly end it can help us to pick the move where we are most likely to win. Game treesAs a human player how do you think about how to play the game How do you weigh alternative moves You likely do a bit of forecasting. This is also represented in the image below. This is because the board contains two distinct patterns that each add one point to the score where both are circled in the image above. There are seven possible moves one for each column. IntroductionEven if you re new to Connect Four you ve likely developed several game playing strategies. The game tree represents each possible move by agent and opponent starting with an empty board. It s also the best outcome for the agent since it has a guaranteed win in just one more move. get_heuristic calculates the value of the heuristic for the supplied board grid where mark is the mark of the agent. In this tutorial you ll learn to use a heuristic to share your knowledge with the agent. mark counts the number of times the agent got four discs in a row. The second board is assigned a score of 1. These functions will make more sense when we use them to specify the agent. For instance The first board where the agent plays in column 0 gets a score of 2. Calculates score if agent drops piece in selected column Helper function for score_move gets board at next step if agent drops piece in selected column Helper function for score_move calculates value of heuristic for grid Helper function for get_heuristic checks if window satisfies heuristic conditions Helper function for get_heuristic counts number of windows satisfying specified heuristic conditions horizontal vertical positive diagonal negative diagonal The agent is always implemented as a Python function that accepts two arguments obs and config Get list of valid moves Convert the board to a 2D grid Use the heuristic to assign a score to each possible board in the next turn Get a list of columns moves that maximize the heuristic Select at random from the maximizing columns Create the game environment Two random agents play one game round Show the game Use default Connect Four setup Agent 1 goes first roughly half the time Agent 2 goes first roughly half the time. The third board where the agent plays in column 2 gets a score of 0. Check this in figure now to make sure it makes sense to you The heuristic works really well for this specific example since it matches the best move with the highest score. The one step lookahead agent is defined in the next code cell. Have questions or comments Visit the course discussion forum https www. For instance setting num_discs 4 and piece obs. It uses a couple of helper functions drop_piece returns the grid that results when the player drops its disc in the selected column. The heuristic assigns scores to different game boards where we estimate that boards with higher scores are more likely to result in the agent winning the game. Finally we get the list of columns that maximize the heuristic and select one uniformly at random. Then we use the heuristic to assign a score to each board. This is because none of the patterns from the heuristic appear in the board. For instance one heuristic that might work reasonably well for Connect Four looks at each group of four adjacent locations in a horizontal vertical or diagonal line and assigns 1000000 1e6 points if the agent has four discs in a row the agent won 1 point if the agent filled three spots and the remaining spot is empty the agent wins if it fills in the empty spot and 100 points if the opponent filled three spots and the remaining spot is empty the opponent wins by filling in the empty spot. In the code for the agent we begin by getting a list of valid moves. The first row shows all possible moves the agent red player can make. To make sure the incomplete tree is still useful to the agent we will use a heuristic or heuristic function. mark 2 1 counts the number of windows where the opponent has three discs and the remaining location is empty the opponent wins by filling in the empty spot. org wiki Word_search puzzle. This will let you identify specific cases when your agent makes bad moves which you can then fix by modifying the heuristic. com learn intro to game ai and reinforcement learning discussion to chat with other learners. To define this agent we will use the functions in the code cell below. how to score different game states or which scores to assign to different conditions often the best thing to do is to simply take an initial guess and then play against your agent. The first board receives the highest score and so the agent will select this move.
