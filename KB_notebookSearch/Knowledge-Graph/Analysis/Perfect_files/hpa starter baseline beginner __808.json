Importing Libraries BASIC EDA LOADING THE DATASET Define the model TRAINING THE MODEL Scores are not that high we need to try out various techniques to improve the score. Notebooks referred to create this kernel are given the comment of this notebook. Next step is try out with image augmentation Work under progress Plot the value counts for each count Split the labels Create a counter. Human Protein Atlas Single Cell Classification competition This is a weakly supervised multi label classification problem. This starter notebook to get an idea on how to approach this competition. If this helped give an upvote. This initializes the count for each class with a value of zero Update the counter Plot.
