Prepare Bounding Box Coordinated for YOLOv5For every image with bounding box es a. also we can rely on the object detector s classification head. Hyperparameters Prepare DatasetThis is the most important section when it comes to training an object detector with YOLOv5. Given an input image the task is to find the region of opacity in the chest using bounding box coordinates. customize iPython writefile so we can write variables Everything is done from kaggle directory. That s why I have used the number of classes nc to be 2. The submisison requires xmin ymin xmax ymax format. txt file with a list of validation images 4. The best model is saved in the directory project_name exp weights best. I am using xhlulu s https www. Box coordinates must be in normalized xywh format from 0 1. We can normalize by the boxes in pixels by dividing x_center and width by image width and y_center and height by image height. Move the images to relevant split folder. com xhlulu siim covid19 resized to 256px jpg. ai ayush thakur kaggle siim covid runs jbt74n7q generated by training the YOLOv5 model. source TEST_PATH absolute path to the test images. What is Weights and Biases Weights Biases W B is a set of machine learning tools that helps you build better models faster. SubmissionIn this section I will show how you can use YOLOv5 as object detector and prepare submission.

After training a YOLOv5 based object detector head to the artifacts page and download the best model upload the model as a Kaggle dataset Use it with the submission folder. Create train validation split. In exp can be 1 2 etc. yaml Configuration file weights yolov5s. Experiment tracking with W B. Path to saved model rightarrow https wandb. Create bounding box coordinates in the required YOLO format. Check out Experiment Tracking with Weights and Biases https www. Find other image resolutions here https www. Out of 1263 test images 583 were predicted with opacity label and thus we have that many prediction txt files. an optional download command URL for auto downloading 2. This section builds every piece needed to train a YOLOv5 model. Note that you might have to clone the YOLOv5 repository in a Kaggle dataset as well. Since I am training the model in this kernel itself I will not be using the method that I have described above. It is saved in this directory runs detect exp3 labels. for this example submisison we will use YOLO s classification head. yaml file needed to train the model. YOLOv5 returns x_center y_center width height Read the txt file generated by YOLOv5 during inference and extract confidence and bounding box coordinates. parent_folder dataset images labels yolov5 We thus will create a tmp directory. img IMG_SIZE Size of image conf 0. Results Check out W B Run Page rightarrow https wandb. Note 1 is class id opacity the first four float numbers are x_center y_center width and height. 5 IOU threshold default is 0. gif Imports and SetupAccording to the official Train Custom Data https github. Create required dataset folder structure and more the images to that folder. com xhlulu resized dataset. csv file Original dimensions are required to scale the bounding box coordinates appropriately. In this section I will show you how you can do the inference and modify the predicted bounding box coordinates. The uploaded 256x256 Kaggle dataset is here https www. a path to a directory of training images or path to a. Get scaling factor xmin ymin xmax ymax Convert the bounding boxes in YOLO format. Merge both the dataframes Create train and validation split. Each cell in the grid is responsible for detecting objects within itself. Train validation split Prepare Required Folder StructureThe required folder structure for the dataset directory is parent_folder dataset images train val labels train val yolov5 Note that I have named the directory covid. You can create your free W B account here https wandb. This is a starter kernel to train a YOLOv5 model on SIIM FISABIO RSNA COVID 19 Detection https www. Train a small YOLOv5 model. Important In this competition each image can either belong to opacity or none image level labels. weights MODEL_PATH path to the best model. txt file with a list of training images 3. The final float value is confidence. Install the latest version of W B and login with your wandb account. ai ayush thakur kaggle siim covid runs 1bk93e3j img https i. Load image level csv file Modify values in the id column Add absolute path Get image level labels Load meta. What is YOLOv5 YOLO an acronym for You only look once is an object detection algorithm that divides images into a grid system. It s a work in progress Required folder structure. ipynb kernel to run all the predictions. Note We don t have to remove the images without bounding boxes from the training or validation sets. batch BATCH_SIZE Batch size epochs EPOCHS Number of epochs data data. com ayuraj experiment tracking with weights and biases to learn more. yaml file Note that I am creating the file in the yolov5 data directory. the number of classes 5. Each row is class x_center y_center width height format.

Read the submisison file Prediction loop for submission do study level classification dummy prediction we can do image level classification here. InferenceYou will probably use a Submission. com c siim covid19 detection overview dataset. Train with W B img IMG_SIZE Input image size. YOLOv5 automatically handles the images without any bounding box coordinates. The directory structure bounding box format etc must be in the correct order. Proper documentation Inference Model prediction visualization. Check out Visualize Bounding Boxes Interactively https www. a list of class names. Weights Biases is directly integrated into YOLOv5 providing experiment metric tracking model and dataset versioning rich model prediction visualization and more. Get the raw bounding box by parsing the row value of the label column. gif The bounding box coordinates are saved as text file per image name. xmax xmin ymax ymin xmin width 2 ymin height 2 x_center y_center width height Prepare the txt files for bounding box Get image id Get split Get image level label Get bboxes Scale bounding boxes Format for YOLOv5 absolute path Visualize predicted coordinates. 45 max det 3 Number of detections per image default is 1000 save txt Save predicted bounding box coordinates as txt files save conf Save the confidence of prediction for each bounding box How to find the confidence score 1. Download YOLOv5 repository and pip install the required dependencies. WORK IN PROGRESSFinal component is model prediction visualization which is an optional debugging tool I would like to share. Bounding box format required for YOLOv5. ai ayush thakur kaggle siim covid artifacts model run_jbt74n7q_model 4c3ca5752dba99bd227e img https i. yaml is the dataset configuration file that defines 1. com yujiariyasu plot 3positive classes Scale the bounding boxes according to the size of the resized image. com ayuraj visualize bounding boxes interactively for interactive bounding box EDA. png file to get a rough estimate of the threshold go to the Bounding Box Debugger panel and interactively adjust the confidence threshold. since we already ran the inference we know which test images belong to opacity. com c siim covid19 detection discussion 239918.
