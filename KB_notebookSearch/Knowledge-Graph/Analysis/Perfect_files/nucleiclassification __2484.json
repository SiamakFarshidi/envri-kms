It depends on the ouput. com kaggle docker python For example here s several helpful packages to load in linear algebra data processing CSV file I O e. We have just imported the libraries required for Logistic Regression and splitting the dataset for training and testing purpose. This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed It is defined by the kaggle python docker image https github. Let s create training and testing I O. Create and define the classifier Now when the classifier is fitted with the training data it has learned the pattern from it. This enables us to acess the data at a faster speed and also making sure the original file is safe and unchanged. This is the main step to perform at the beginning of every data science or machine learning project. This can be imporved further by using different classification algorithms or ensemble methods. We can go ahead and start predicting with the test dataset input. Let s find out the confusion matrix and accuracy. to split the dataset for training and testing for checking the model accuracy. Hello I m glad to be making this kernel for you guys. Here the output is binary. read_csv Input data files are available in the. We can measure the performance of the classifier by using accuracy and confusion matrix. So the pixel intensities value will differ at the nuclei and the cell space. Check the unique entries of the output column which is in question. It is clear that classification algorithms should be employed to solve this task. head command to confirm the importing of data to the dataframe. Let s split the data into training and test datasets as it is important to measure the accuracy of our model with the dataset test it has not learned from. So let s import the library for it. jpg When trying to detect nuclei in a histology picture it is clear that the nuclei is darker in color than its surroundings. Now you might think which machine learning algorithms to use. Thank you and let me know how I can improve my explainations. Hope you understand the steps I have laid out down below. Anyone with a small experience in image processing would be aware that the pictures can be represented in the form the pixel intensitites of each pixel. Create a dataframe by importing all the values from the csv file. For example running this by clicking run or pressing Shift Enter will list the files in the input directory Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output. Each row of the file contains pixel intensity values and the final column contains a 0 or a 1 which denotes whether there is any nuclei present in that specific picture. You can implement SVM RandomForest Classifier etc. For this dataset I ll be using Logistic Regression. com b nucleolus hepatocyte liver cells hepatocytes seen light microscope their nuclei show very large stained red 93292624.
