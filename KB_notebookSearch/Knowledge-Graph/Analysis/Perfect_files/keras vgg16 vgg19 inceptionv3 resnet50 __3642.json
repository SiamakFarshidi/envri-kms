Let s also look at the class distribution. com kaggle docker python For example here s several helpful packages to load in linear algebra data processing CSV file I O e. For example running this by clicking run or pressing Shift Enter will list all files under the input directory Plotly for the interactive viewer see last section for dirname _ filenames in os. com frlemarchand high res samples into multi input cnn keras. If the cancer is almost entirely made up of cells with the same score the grade for that area is counted twice to calculated the total Gleason Score. fit_generator train_generator steps_per_epoch nb_train_steps epochs 20 validation_data validation_generator validation_steps nb_val_steps callbacks callbacks history InceptionResnet_conv.

ISUP gradeAccording to current guidelines by the International Society of Urological Pathology ISUP the Gleason scores are summarized into an ISUP grade on a scale from 1 to 5 according to the following rule Gleason score 6 ISUP grade 1 Gleason score 7 3 4 ISUP grade 2 Gleason score 7 4 3 ISUP grade 3 Gleason score 8 ISUP grade 4 Gleason score 9 10 ISUP grade 5. An example as provided on the official page of the competition can make us understand better. The classes are imbalanced more severe cases are underrepresented. Figure out normalized expected values shift the values so that the lowest value is 0 to support scales that include negative values Build the observed confusion matrix Normalize observed array If all weights are zero that means no disagreements matter. tiff file some of them will be used for testing. com c prostate cancer grade assessment overview additional resources. walk kaggle input for filename in filenames print os. h5 creates a HDF5 file my_model. train_label_masks Folder with segmentation masks showing which parts of the image led to the ISUP grade. The appearance of the glands forms the basis of the Gleason grading system. These images are pretty big in size for training I ll be using the resized 512x512 dataset uploaded by xhlulu. org images about murtagh7e_c114_f04 2. fit_generator train_generator steps_per_epoch nb_train_steps epochs 10 validation_data validation_generator validation_steps nb_val_steps generator to activate the augmentation. com kaggle media competitions PANDA Screen 20Shot 202020 04 08 20at 202. These masks may assist with the development of strategies for selecting useful image subsamples and the values might depend also on the data provider. Let s take a look at one of the biopsy. png This is how Gleason score is decided from 3 5 5 being the most severe. 00 as almost perfect agreement. 1 VGG16 model VGG19 model Uncomment last line to run the model InceptionV3 model Uncomment last line to run the model Resnet50 model Uncomment last line to run the model pip install tensorflow 2. Not all training images have label masks and there may be false positives or false negatives in the label masks. read_csv Input data files are available in the. train_images A folder containing biopsy images in a large multilevel. According to Cohen s original article values 0 as indicating no agreement and 0. The samples are made up of glandular tissue and connective tissue. VGG16 BaselineData train. Hyperparameter Tuning Inference This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed It is defined by the kaggle python docker image https github. csv image_id karlonski radhound gleason and ISUP grade. For instance if the Gleason Score is written as 3 4 7 it means most of the tumor is grade 3 and the next largest section of the tumor is grade 4 together they make up the total Gleason Score. Let s take a look at the architecture. Testing Keras implementation of QWK Calculating QWK score with scikit learn Keras implementation of QWK work with one hot encoding labels and predictions also it works with softmax probabilities Converting arrays to one hot encoded representation Calculating QWK score with Keras vgg_conv. The glands are hollow structures which can be seen as white holes or branched cavities in the WSI. Gleason Score Since prostate tumors are often made up of cancerous cells that have different grades two grades are assigned for each patient. Display the image Close the opened slide after use Image data generator generates varied images with the input data for better prediction for the models shear is avoided since the cancerous cells look like sheared normal cells validation_split 0. h5 submission code from https www. png The most common blue outline Gleason pattern 3 and second most common red outline Gleason pattern 4 cancer growth patterns present in the biopsy dictate the Gleason score 3 4 for this biopsy which in turn is converted into an ISUP grade 2 for this biopsy following guidelines of the International Society of Urological Pathology. Let s start preparing the images for training. Biopsies not containing cancer are represented by an ISUP grade of 0 in this challenge. So the basic preprocessing I ve done is Normalizing the images. 0 Uncomment any one to run the corresponding summary Including batch Normalization freeze layers before 99 unfreeze layers after 99 kappa score is the metric we use since two types of evaluation is done on the data set The kappa statistic. 80 as substantial 0. We are asked to predict ISUP grade scale 0 5 for each prostate biopsy image which is in turn derived from the gleason score three categories 3 4 5. 20 as none to slight 0. Before diving deeper into the competition let s try to understand these first. A primary grade is given to describe the cells that make up the largest area of the tumor and a secondary grade is given to describe the cells of the next largest area. join dirname filename Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.
