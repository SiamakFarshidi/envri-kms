Hence we write rho_ X Y frac text Cov X Y sigma_x sigma_y approx frac sum_ i 1 n x_i bar x y_i bar y sqrt sum_ i 1 n x_i bar x 2 sqrt sum_ i 1 n y_i bar y 2 Here s a hand implementation of this measurement Correlation is a very fundamental property of your variables. In practice always scatter plot your data to confirm what you think you are seeing Finally the Pearson is just one kind of correlation coefficient. 4 like that of the third scoring distribution in this chart not nearly as good but still with an identifiable trend. This is demonstrated quite nicely in the third row of the diagram above which shows various shapes that have near 0 correlation. First though we ll have to understand what Pearson s correlation coefficient is. And note that the correlation coefficient of a variable to itself is always exactly 1. In this notebook we ll use the Pearson correlation coefficient as abbreviated Pearson s r as in the notebook title to guage the degree of linearity in Google health search volume. com residentmario spearman correlation with montreal bikes. The utility of the standard deviation is demonstrated very nicely by the normal distribution whose values can be measured in their unusualness very effectively using that number https upload. svg The more tightly linear two variables X and Y are the closer Pearson s correlation coefficient henceforth PCC will be to either 1 if the relationship is negative or 1 if the relationship is positive. org wikipedia commons d d4 Correlation_examples2. Variance is a squared property while the standard deviation is a linear property. A correlation coefficient is any measurement of data variable interdependence which has the property that it ranges between 1 and 1 for total dependence and 0 for total independence. But what is covariance To understand this formula start by looking at variance. ApplicationWe re now going to look at an application of the Pearson correlation coefficient to real data. The second most popular correlation coefficient the Spearmann correlation coefficient is the subject of another notebook https www. It was very taxing to plot all nine scatter plots over time. Second of all the Pearson correlation coefficient can only measure linear relationships between data. We are correct the Pearson correlation coefficient within a certain amount of randomness does go up over time The health searches dataset gives us access to nine time series like this one. We ll use the Google health search dataset helpfully published on Kaggle by their News Labs to do so. Covariance measures the joint variance of two distributions. First of all it s important to note that the Pearson correlation coefficient is both scale and location invariant. svg A comparison between search today and search three to five years ago is much like looking at the blob in the second 0. Simple So far we ve been talking about a distribution but when we work with data we don t know the underlying distribution we just have a bunch of values. Because of how popular the Pearson coefficient is it is sometimes just called variable correlation but it s not the only way to measure this. Linear changes in the data like increasing the slope of the data or moving every data point up by some number of units will not change the Pearson correlation coefficient. By plotting the correlation coefficents over time we have a way to understand how similar medical searches today are to ones in the past that can be fit into a single line chart. It s a general purpose measurement that can be taken before you do any modeling. Like unary variance covariance measures the square of the average distance between the points in a distribution and the mean of the distribution but since there are now two variables that measurement is now a distance in two dimensions Pearson s correlation coefficient normalizes covariance by dividing it by the standard deviation of either of the variables being measured. Pretty tight Going back ten years we get a coefficient of around 0. Relationships between data points that are more complex such as polynomial relationships will elude this measurement and have a coefficient near 0. This is a helpful property because it makes the coefficient easier to interpret and compare over datasets in practice but because of this the coefficient is not a good model fit metric. The higher the correlation between your target variable and your predictor variables as a rule the better your model will perform. The following chart from Wikipedia demonstrates the correlation coefficients of various distributions https upload. Closing remarksThere are a few more things that are worth stating about the Pearson correlation coefficient. To interpret this chart it s helpful to look at the distributions image from earlier https upload. org wikipedia commons 8 8c Standard_deviation_diagram. The data covers the period 2004 through 2017 with a different index value for every place and every year. 8 Pearson scoring distribution in the top row of this picture. org wiki Pearson_correlation_coefficient is a statistic which measures the degree of linear correlation between two variables. This dataset is interesting because we naturally expect there to be a relationship between the search volume for a specific term in 2004 and 2017 but we expect this relationship to be much stronger the closer we get to 2017 maxing out in 2016. Mathematically Pearson s correlation coefficient can be stated as rho_ X Y frac text Cov X Y sigma_x sigma_y Pearson s correlation coefficient is normalized covariance. Diarrhea seems to be the medical topic whose searches are least similar today to what they were in the past while more weakly cancer seems to be the most consistent. So we need to come up with a Pearson s correlation coefficient statistic using statistics which measure the covariance and standard deviation of the variables in question. Pearson s r with Health SearchesThe Pearson correlation coefficient https en. A high variance means that the distribution is very spread out but it can be difficult to interpret variance because it is a squared term. The health search dataset includes an index of volumes of searches for various common medical topics throughout an assortment of areas in the United States. All of the medical topics includes in this dataset are relatively samey with respect to the present search pattern within the last few years but there is increasing amounts of variance going back to 2014. The standard deviation of a distribution sigma X or sigma_x is the square root of the variance. svg So for example a point as rare or rarer than one three standard deviations from the mean has only a 0. 2 chance of occuring. Perfectly linearly uncorrelated numbers will recieve a PCC of 0. We can verify that this is indeed the case by plotting the joint distributions of these variables using seaborn As you can see the second of these distributions is significantly closer to linear than the first one is Let s see if our hypothesis holds for the cancer search topic for the rest of the years in the dataset.
