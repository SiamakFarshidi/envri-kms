The last step is to put back the faces in the original image. Corner detection 14. We can now count the numbers showed in the dices. This technique is widely used to provide a better look in some images. The image above shows the corner as white points. Noise e denoising 10. As an axample take a look in the next image. To filter the noise out we can use the denoise_tv_chambolle function of the skimage. Apply detector on the image X and Y starting points of the face rectangle The width and height of the face rectangle Extract the detected face X and Y starting points of the face rectangle The width and height of the face rectangle Apply gaussian filter to extracted face Merge this blurry face to our final image and show it. First lets find the contours of an image. The skimage library has some good features we can use to manipulate images. It changes the pixel values and makes some parts of the image more exposed compared to the original image. But the value of thresh has to be defined. Gray scale images have just a channel with its pixels value ranging from 0 to 255. Those operations can be done using the skimage. A famous function to find edges is called canny. Thresholding algorithms 4. We can simulate this noise by applying the random_noise function to the image. The summary of the notebook 1. To solve that problem we have to apply the binariation to regions of the image. Other way to denoise an image is to apply the denoise_bilateral function also from skimage. An image is made up of pixels. From a colored image we can reach a gray scaled image using color function NumPy on image processingThe NumPy library has some famous features. Morphological operationsMorphological operations provide some dilations and erosion on the images. Some of those features are used in image processing too. Finding contours 12. The function we will use to face detection is named detect_multi_scale from skimage. FiltersA filter is a mathematical function applied to images. filters ant its function called sobel. First extract the face rectangle from the image using the coordinates of the detected Then detect the faces Finally we apply the gaussian filter in each face The EndThank you so much for reading this notebook. Corner DetectionA corner can be defined as the intersection of two edges. To do this some algorithms are present in the skimage library. We can enhace an image changing its contrast or doing whats is called histogram equalization. It can be done applying the superpixel segmentation. NumPy on image processing 3. Histogram with Matplotlib 3. Blurring faces for privacy protection. We can measure size classify shapes ande also Determine the number of objects by just using the shape of the image. An image may be gray scale or colored. Some commun transformations of an image is to rotate rescaling and resize. The classifier is designed so that it can be easily resized in order to be able to find the objects of interest at different sizes which is more efficient than resizing the image itself. transform as some good functions to make transform images. But first lets create a function to show images with better view. SegmentationImage segmentation is the process of assigning a label to every pixel in an image such that pixels with the same label share certain characteristics. The histogram equalization makes the histogram of the image flat. With this function we can chose the number of regions to segment the image. We can try all those algorithms using the function try_all_threshold from skimage. But this library can also show the histogram of a image. Each pixel has a position and a value that refers to its color. Noise and DenoisingNoise are common distortions in images. After a classifier is trained it can be applied to a region of interest of the same size as used during the training in an input image. Create a function to show de detected face We can also detec more than one face Blurring faces for privacy protection. One application using some knowledge we that we obtained is to blur faces detected in ah image. Finding contoursFinding contours of an image is a good way to explore its features. More informations about this algorithm can be found at this site Haar Feature based Cascade Classifier for Object Detection https docs. But first we need do this. Finding EdgesEdge detection includes a variety of mathematical methods that aim at identifying points in a digital image at which the image brightness changes sharply or more formally has discontinuities. Using those pixel values we can threshold then to a limit value To thresh a image is normally called binarization of the image. As an example take a look in the Sobel Filter and its edge detection. There ara some others algorithms to equalize the histogram like adaptive histogram equalization TransformationTransform a image can provide some pre processing tools to better understand informations presents in the image. 4 modules objdetect doc cascade_classification. plot its histogram with 256 bins the number of possible values of a pixel. To do that we first get the faces presented in an image then apply a filter. Contrast EnhancementEnhance an image can show some features not present in the original data. Histograms show the count of each pixel value Thresholding algorithmsHistograms are tipically used to to see the range of pixels values in a image. But we can match those corners and show them. face car and 0 otherwise. To do that we use the function threshold_local from skimage. To apply the optimal thresh we can use the Otsu algorithm As we can see by the use of those algorithms the right corner don t show the words as we expected. An interest point is a point in an image which has a well defined position and can be robustly detectedCorners can be found by using the function corner_harris and corner_peaks from skimage. Contrast enhancement 6. To do this the binarization is a good way. This segmentations is done using unsupervised K means algorithm. set a random thresh value define the size of the region to apply the binarization apply the function use the coins image as an example apply the filter you have to specify the multichannel rotate clockwise rescaling by 1 2 of the original image rescaling by 1 2 of the original image the shape of the original image the shape of the rescaled image the shape of the original image the shape of the resized image set a random thresh value import te slic function import te label2rgb function segmentation with 400 regions segmentation with 400 regions A function to show the contour of the image find de coordinates of the corners load the training file initialize the detector cascade. For the Text image we can provide a better loking in its rigth conner. The first we will see is to import some images. Image Processing in PythonThis notebook presents some image processing techniques with python. Any problem please talk to me Bye show a image of a rocket the third argument in parenthesis indicates that there are three channels in that image the size of a image is the total count of pixels 427x640 using the red channel of the rocket image. But first lets ma ke a function to compare original images to processed images. To see this feature use the gaussian filter function. What is image processing Image processing is to apply of some operations to images like enhance an image extract useful information and analyze it and make decisions. So to find an object of an unknown size in the image the scan procedure should be done several times at different scales. The histogram equalization is achieved using the equalize_hist function from skmigage. A common noise we is te salt and pepper noise. I has used this library to create the function show_image. Face detectionFace detection is a computer technology being used in a variety of applications that identifies human faces in digital images. A simple thresholding of an image can provide an segmentation But we can segement an image by more meaningful regions. Face detection also refers to the psychological process by which humans locate and attend to faces in a visual scene. It can enhancing an image emphasize or remove features smooth an image or detect edges for example. The classifier outputs a 1 if the region is likely to show the object i. What is image processing 2. We can use filters to smooth an image too. As a first demonstration flip images NumPy also can be used to show the rgb channels of a image NumPy can also show the shape and size of images Histogram with MatplotlibMatplotLib is a famous library from python used to plot graphs and show images. Colored images have three channels of color one to red oter to blue and other to green the rgb set with its pixels value ranging from 0 to 255 for each channel. We can list some applications for image processing medical image analysis artificial intelligence image restoration and geospatial computing. Morphology operations 9. To use that filter we need the library skimage. This functions is found in the skimage. I hope I helped you understand image processing. The objective is to show some easy techniques to apply as pre processing to use in images from datasets to train test some Machine Learning models. A corner can also be defined as a point for which there are two dominant and different edge directions in a local neighbourhood of the point.
