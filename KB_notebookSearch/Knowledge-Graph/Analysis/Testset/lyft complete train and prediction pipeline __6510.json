Unfortunately because of Kaggle memory constraint we can only either run the train part or the prediction part by toggling the parameters in the config part. More information about the loss function can be found here negative log likelihood https github. Unfortunately due to Kaggle memory constraint if train True then you should put predict False. batch_size number of inputs for one forward pass again one of the parameters to tune. Also please add pretrained baseline model https www. It is much faster to do this rather than pip install l5kit every time you run the notebook. com corochann Lyft Comprehensive guide to start competition https www. Now let us initialize the model and load the pretrained weights. Click File botton on top left and choose Add utility script. 0 release https www. Then you can add the kaggle l5kit utility script. Let me know your suggestions in the comments below. Please upvote if this kernel helps you. Our goal is to predict three possible paths together with the confidence score so we need to use the loss function that takes that into account simply using RMSE will not lead to an accurate model. com corochann lyft comprehensive guide to start competition Lyft Deep into the l5kit library https www. com lyftlevel5 how to build a motion prediction model for autonomous vehicles 29f7f81f1580. Loss functionFor this competition it is important to use the correct loss function when train the model. PredictionFinally we implement the inference to submit to Kaggle when predict param is set to True. If successful you can see usr lib lyft l5kit unofficial fix is added to the Data section of this kernel page on right side of the kernel. However the training time will be significantly longer. For the pretrained model we use resnet18 so we need to use resnet18 in the config. com c lyft motion prediction autonomous vehicles discussion 186492 and l5kit 1. html This notebook is updated to be compatible with the new lyft environment see the discussion We did it all wrong https www. com corochann lyft prediction with multi mode confidence which is part of a wonderful series of introductory notebooks by corochann https www. Note that since the pretrained model was trained on GPU you also need to enable GPU when running this notebook. Unfortunately due to Kaggle memory constraint if you want to predict then you need to put train False. Training loopNext let us implement the training loop when the train parameter is set to True. com corochann lyft prediction with multi mode confidence Note This notebook aims to create the best single possible i. com huanvo lyft pretrained model hv Click on the button Add data in the Data section and search for lyft pretrained model hv.

In this notebook I present an end to end train and prediction pipeline to predict vehicle motions with a pretrained model included. train True if you want to continue to train the model. max_num_steps the number of iterations to train i. Since it is still early in the competition this notebook is still a baseline any suggestion to improve is appreciated. Feel free to modify this kernel as you wish. Note that this model will return three possible trajectories together with confidence score for each trajectory. Lyft Complete train and prediction pipeline update for l5kit 1. without any ensemeble which should only be done near the end of the competition. weight_path path to the pretrained model. Some of the code here are taken from the tutorial notebook https github. com c lyft motion prediction autonomous vehicles discussion 187825.
