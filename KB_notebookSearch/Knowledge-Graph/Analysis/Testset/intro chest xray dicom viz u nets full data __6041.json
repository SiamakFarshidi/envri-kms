Below I extract some basic info with an image. Personally I can t really make out how to find the pneumothorax in the images. Especially Heng CherKeng https www. com hengck23 learned a bunch from them and the list below is heavily influenced by them. 02579 Data Distillation https arxiv. I m hiding some cells for readability below just fork the kernel or click the Show code on the right to see imports etc. com c rsna pneumonia detection challenge https www. net tutorial _images unet. read_csv Input data files are available in the. Here we actually get to do dense prediction. 02002 although Dice https arxiv. Analyze the metadata There be leakage. It becomes very evident that we have to be careful about the top right marker on the image. 03237 is the LB loss. Build PatchesReshape to get non overlapping patches. The different L may mess with our data. com c tgs salt identification challenge discussion 63984 latest 425973 are Look at the masks There be dragons. In challenges I link below only bounding boxes were available. com stochastic weight averaging a new way to get state of the art results in deep learning c639ccf36a. For example running this by clicking run or pressing Shift Enter will list the files in the input directory Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output. This kernel https www. The general idea is Black Air Gray Fluids and Tissue White Bone and SolidsSo the issue is that an air enclosure may just be a mild disturbance in the chest xray. As losses go definitely check out IOU Jaccard Intersection over union Lovasz https arxiv. They re having a stinging pain in the chest. Quite useful to programatically read. This isn t working as well as I d like it to but I ll leave it here for now. http deeplearning. If not treated a collapsed lung ish or air on the wrong side of the lung can result in death. Your patient comes in. Particularly it may be benefitial not training on 1024x1024 images but patches of the image. 04440 maybe some Global Attention https arxiv. org wiki DICOM article for it. Then we ll look at 3 images and the masks that come with it. Let s first take a look at the sample images that are available. You will know about the gender and age of the patient as well as info how the image is sampled and generated. io preprocessing image instead. 08790 and Focal methods https arxiv. 5752 Squeeze Excitation https arxiv. 04597 maybe use a pretty pre trained encoder instead of the following. Learnings from Other Segmentation ChallengesThese are of course some learnings I gained but they are from the amazing kagglers in all the links so please give them the credits. We can see different modes of collection. com jesperdramsch intro to seismic salt and how to geophysics What is DICOM Dicom is a format that has metadata as well as Pixeldata attached to it. Sources I used and further reading https www. com c rsna pneumonia detection challenge Use TFRecords https www. Predict empty masks Binary Classification Break down problem Male Female Networks Multiclass Active learning of sorting out easy and hard to classify images Confidence Intervals Pesudo labeling semi suervised learning knowledge distillation adversarial training Additional labeling or supervisory signal Clustering KNN for image patches This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed It is defined by the kaggle python docker image https github. And that shadow is air. What s a Pneumothorax https en. Also thanks to Ehsan make sure to transpose the masks Vanilla UnetSo how would we work the data on GCP I d suggest a very nice Unet https arxiv. This kernel is just giving some starting info and how to look at the data with the given tools. Play around with it in some of the other images it is definitely more visible than in others. com lyonzy convert dicom images to tfrecords Check Out Unets https www. net pictures 50000 nahled anatomy high tech. How do the masks look like First let s look at all the sample images. Considering convolutional neural networks are exceptional at identifying abnormalities we may want them to take a look as not to miss these tiny abnormalities. jpg In this challenge we get chest xrays and masks. The data is loading the model is training I m still hoping for clarification on the submission as there is a mismatch between the smaple_submission. com jesperdramsch intro to seismic salt and how to geophysics or the Carvana https www. Some common tricks on kaggle image segmentation https www. com toregil a lung u net in keras might be interesting but there are many on kaggle on lung segmentation mine on salt segmentation https www. The X Ray shows a shadow on the lung. org wiki Pneumothorax Problem is in an X Ray air is usually the thing you ignore. You ll be able to transfer this kernel to downloaded data to visualize other bits and explore their metadata. You ll probably enjoy Hypercolumns https arxiv. Comment this out to see all Starting index of images Total number of images to show Get train images and masks Assume missing masks are empty masks. org wiki Stratified_sampling and consider using a nice Generator https keras. Train a scrappy networkDefinitely work in progress though. com c carvana image masking challenge challenge. They re excellent on small ish datasets and particularly on image segmentation. Here s the Wikipedia https en. csv and the provided data. Futuristic view of human https www. There are many others you may try but maybe this one will get you started. jpg Load Full DatasetThis is the point I shake my fist at unstripped strings. Better ideas are to use proper train validation splits possibly with stratification https en. com schlerp getting to know dicom and the data dataSome ideas that might be helpful Check out Pneumonia X Ray Challenge https www. Could it be usable leakage as it points to the hospital it was taken at Yes yes it could but I m sure Kaggle took care of this.
