The Weight of a Diamond has the most significant Impact on its Price. 1 Explore Dataset Examine what Features affect the Price of Diamonds. 2 Extract Dataset Specify the location to the Dataset and Import them. Feature Engineering there_you_go_4 5. 7 KNeighbours Regression Tuning Parameters 8 Visualizing R2 Score of Algorithms Random Forest Regressor gives us the highest R2 Score 98. X Length of the Diamond in mm. Clarity Diamond Clarity refers to the absence of the Inclusions and Blemishes. Collect all R2 Scores. It can t be possible. png Carat vs Price It seems that Carat varies with Price Exponentially. It doesn t make any sense to have either of Length or Width or Height to be zero. Then Apply Feature Scaling although it s not neccessary in this case. As we can t feed String data for Modelling. The middle line of the box is the median or the 50 percentile. Obviously in that part of the Earth it s very hot. Click Here to Learn More about How Table Affects the Price of Diamonds. Z Height of the Diamond in mm. 5 Examine NaN Values Great So there are no NaN values. The Length x Width y and Height z seems to be higly related to Price and even each other. Quality in increasing order Fair Good Very Good Premium Ideal. They are the hardest Gemstones known to man and can be scratched only by other Diamonds. Quantitative Features Numerical Carat Depth Table Price X Y Z. The side lines of the box are the 25 and 75 percentiles respectively. 3 Color The Color of a Diamond refers to the Tone and Saturation of Color or the Depth of Color in a Diamond. Exploring Dataset there_you_go_1 2. Qualitative Features Categorical Cut Color Clarity. 4 Ridge Regression 7. We ll Create a New Feature based on the Dimensions in the Next Section called Volume and Visualize how it affects the Price. Comparing R2 Scores there_you_go_8 What are Diamonds Diamonds are the Precious stone consisting of a clear and colourless Crystalline form of pure carbon. Values of X Y and Z. And therefore Diamonds are considered to be Very Costly. Price is the Target Variable. Click Here to Learn More about How Clarity Affects the Price of Diamonds. Click Here to Learn More about How Color Affects the Price https enchanteddiamonds. 4 Clarity Diamond Clarity refers to the absence of the Inclusions and Blemishes. Inclusions can be Cracks or even Small Minerals or Crystals that have formed inside the Diamond. 4 Feature Engineering 4. 3 AdaBosst Regression 7. 1 Linear Regression 7. Let s Confirm just to visualize. So We have 53 940 rows and 10 columns It seems there are no Null Values. Click Here to Learn More about How Carat Affects the Price of Diamonds. Table The Width of the Diamond s Table expressed as a Percentage of its Average Diameter. 1 Importing Libraries 1. jpg Color vs Price 3. Blemishing is a result of utting and polishing process than the environmental conditions in which the diamond was formed. jpg It seems that VS1 and VS2 affect the Diamond s Price equally having quite high Price margin. 7 Scaling of all Features The Values are Distributed over a Small Scale. Since the larger a Stone is the Rarer it is one 2 Carat Diamond will be more Expensive than the Total cost of two 1 Carat Diamonds of the Same Quality. 7 Modelling Algos 7. Split the data into train and test. Visualization Of All Features 3. 7 Dimensions As the Dimensions increases Obviously the Prices Rises as more and more Natural Resources are Utilised. DIAMONDS IN DEPTH ANALYSIS You can also view the notebook on the link below. 6 Dropping Rows with Dimensions Zero. Correlation b w Features there_you_go_2 3. Some other Inferences can also be drawn. In order from Best to Worst FL flawless I3 level 3 inclusions FL IF VVS1 VVS2 VS1 VS2 SI1 SI2 I1 I2 I3 Depth The Height of a Diamond measured from the Culet to the table divided by its average Girdle Diameter. Let s Have a look at them. Click Here to Learn More about How Depth Affects the Price of Diamonds. com grading depth and table values We can Infer from the plot that the Price can vary heavily for the same Depth. 6 RandomForest Regression Tuning Parameters 7. jpg How Diamonds are formed Diamonds are formed deep within the Earth about 100 miles or so below the surface in the upper mantle. Colorless Diamonds are Rarer and more Valuable because they appear Whiter and Brighter. Feature Scaling there_you_go_6 7. Wait Do you see the Min. com diamond education diamond cut https i. jpg Cut vs Price Premium Cut on Diamonds as we can see are the most Expensive followed by Excellent Very Good Cut. 5 Depth The Depth of a Diamond is its Height in millimeters measured from the Culet to the Table. With D being the best and J the worst. of a feature to itself is 1 as expected. Click Here to Lean More about How Cut Affects the Price. There s a lot of pressure the weight of the overlying rock bearing down so that combination of high temperature and high pressure is what s necessary to grow diamond crystals in the Earth. Thank You Ignore warnings Handle table like data and matrices Modelling Algorithms Classification Regression Modelling Helpers preprocessing evaluation metrics Regression Classification Visualisation Configure visualisations Center all plots How the data looks We ll Explore All the features in the Later Part Now let s look for Null Values if any. Applying Feature Scaling StandardScaler You can also Apply MinMaxScaler. Feature Encoding there_you_go_5 6. The Price of the Diamond is highly correlated to Carat and its Dimensions. Why are Diamonds so Valuable Whether it is a Rare book a fine bottle of Scotch or a Diamond something that is Rare and Unique is often expensive. com education understanding diamond color https i. 1 Create New Feature Volume It seems that there is Linear Relationship between Price and Volume x y z. But what makes it truly Valuable is that this Rarity coincides with the desire of many to possess it. The Weight Carat of a diamond has the most significant impact on its Price. It includes scratches extra facets etc. We can see there are 20 rows with Dimensions Zero. Correlation Map Visualize via kde plots Understanding Box Plot The bottom line indicates the min value of Age. Just to Confirm Nice and Clean. Depth is inversely related to Price. This is because if a Diamond s Depth percentage is too large or small the Diamond will become __Dark__ in appearance because it will no longer return an Attractive amount of light. 2 Lasso Regression 7. Diamonds are Rare because of the Incredibly powerful forces needed to create them. 5 GradientBoosting Regression 7. This is because there is a Higher Wastage of the Rough Stone as more Material needs to be Removed in order to achieve better Proportions and Symmetry. The upper line indicates the max value. If it is too Small then the light will get Trapped and that Attention grabbing shaft of light will never come out but will leak from other places in the Diamond. An Inclusion is an Imperfection located within a Diamond. 6 Table Table is the Width of the Diamond s Table expressed as a Percentage of its Average Diameter. The carat of a Diamond is often very Important to People when shopping But it is a Mistake to Sacrifice too much quality for sheer size. 2 Cut Although the Carat Weight of a Diamond has the Strongest Effect on Prices the Cut can still Drastically Increase or Decrease its value. Cut Describe cut quality of the diamond. If the Table Upper Flat Facet is too Large then light will not play off of any of the Crown s angles or facets and will not create the Sparkly Rainbow Colors. Visualizations there_you_go_3 4. 2 Drop X Y Z 5 Feature Encoding Label the Categorical Features with digits to Distinguish. We ll Drop them as it seems better choice instead of filling them with any of Mean or Median 1. Modelling Algorithms there_you_go_7 8. The Color of a Diamond can Range from Colorless to a Yellow or a Faint Brownish Colored hue. Y Width of the Diamond in mm. Since the larger a stone is the Rarer it is one 2 carat diamond will be more __Expensive__ than the total cost of two 1 Carat Diamonds of the same Quality. 4 Drop the Unnamed 0 column as we already have Index. With a Higher Cut Quality the Diamond s Cost per Carat Increases. And the Pearson s Correlation shows that there s a slightly inverse relation between the two. 3 Features Carat Carat weight of the Diamond. 1 Carat Carat refers to the Weight of the Stone not the Size. 2 Correlation Between Features CONCLUSIONS 1. If a Diamond s Depth Percentage is too large or small the Diamond will become Dark in appearance because it will no longer return an Attractive amount of light. com blog understanding how diamond clarity affects value https i. com Chinmayrane16 Diamonds In Depth Analysis Do Upvote if you like it Topics1. com grading depth and table values 3.
