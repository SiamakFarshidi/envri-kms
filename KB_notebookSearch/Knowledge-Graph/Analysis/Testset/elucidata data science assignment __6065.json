Interferons IFNs are a group of signaling proteins made and released by host cells in response to the presence of several pathogens such as viruses bacteria parasites and also tumor cells. Let s explore some variables Clearly 65 of time patient are dead if mRNAseq_cluster type is 1 and 3. pathologic_stage Stage of cancer amount or spread of cancer in the body pathologic_m The M refers to whether the cancer has metastasized. Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma PAAD is the third most common cause of death from cancer with an overall 5 year survival rate of less than 5 and is predicted to become the second leading cause of cancer mortality in the United States by 2030. GCT file The GCT file format a tab delimited text based format pairing matrix expression values with row and column metadata allowing comparison of both transcriptional and contextual differences across samples. For example running this by clicking run or pressing Shift Enter will list all files under the input directory Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output. png Let s dive into data and explore it. pathologic_t The T refers to the size and extent of the main tumor. may pose data leakage adenocarcinoma_invasion Tells about cancer grows and spreads to near cell or not. gct data format https github. The main tumor is usually called the primary tumor. The M refers to whether the cancer has metastasized. Let s read these 25 IFN signature This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed It is defined by the kaggle python docker image https github. 04 million cases Stomach 1. Data Exploration Here we have a dataset of normalized RNA Sequencing reads for pancreatic cancer tumors. Genes Structures Ribonucleic acid RNA is a polymeric molecule essential in various biological roles in coding decoding regulation and expression of genes. RNA and DNA are nucleic acids and along with lipids proteins and carbohydrates constitute the four major macromolecules essential for all known forms of life. 09 million cases Breast 2. Cancer mortality can be reduced if cases are detected and treated early. vital_status Current status of patient live death. maximum_tumor_dimension Size of Tumor tumor size is strongly related to chances for survival. mRNAseq_cluster estimates of the levels of individual isoforms within the cell of RNA sequence. This means that the cancer has spread from the primary tumor to other parts of the body. RNA Seq RNA sequencing is a sequencing technique to detect the quantity of RNA in a biological sample at a given moment. Type I interferons IFNs are a large subgroup of interferon proteins that help regulate the activity of the immune system. IntroductionThis notebook is a part of Assignment provided by Elucidata for 6 months internship in data science. The genes responsible for type 1 Interferons is called Type 1 IFN signature and consists a set of 25 genes in homo sapiens. majority of patient have pathologic_t3 and pathologic_n1 types stages. Lets see individual dataframe and explore it. A schematic of a sample GCT file is pictured below. read_csv Input data files are available in the. The N refers to the the number of nearby lymph nodes that have cancer. The measurement consists of 20 000 genes for 183 pancreatic cancer tumors. participant_id unique value for each patient. mRNAseq_cluster 1 3 4 are risky types then 2 5 Types of tumer not play role in current vital status of patient. on average which has higher tumor dimension are most likely to dead. bcr_patient_barcode and bcr_patient_uuid representing the metadata of the participants and their samples. pathologic stages are as follow stage 0 Abnormal cells are present but have not spread to nearby tissue. Columns metadata explain about behaviour of patient. Read all portion of data Columns meta data Shape of columns metadata Number of missing values in each column of col_meta_data Explore each columns of col_meatadata drop columns which have constant value Number of missing values in each column of my data Fill in the lines below imputation removed column names put them back Lets combine col_meta_data and my_data. In this assignment we are going to analyse the previous data of genes structure to detect the cancer patient and provide early treatment. 80 million cases Prostate 1. The higher the number the larger the cancer tumor and the more it has spread into nearby tissues. this rid show the types of RNA sequence 18465 different types of RNA seq. Data set have not this stage because approx all adenocarcinoma_invasion value is True. Cancer arises from the transformation of normal cells into tumour cells in a multistage process that generally progresses from a pre cancerous lesion to a malignant tumour. The T refers to the size and extent of the main tumor. This means that the cancer has spread from the primary tumor to other parts of the body pathologic_n The N refers to the the number of nearby lymph nodes that have cancer. 28 million cases Skin cancer non melanoma 1. The file format is GCT a tab delimited file used for sharing gene expression data and metadata details for each sample for samples. What can be said about the variance of the PCA Visualize the data whole data using PCA. 6 million deaths in 2018. Load DatasetHere we parse our dataset into GCToo pandas dataframe instance which contains 3 component dataframes row_metadata_df column_metadata_df and data_df. sample_type is our target variable which tells that which patient have cancer tumor or not. There is 50 50 chance of patient are currently alive or deadApprox every patient cancer grows and spreads into body cells. the neuroendocrine tumors clearly not separable from the adenocarcinoma tumors 2Lets Remove the neuroendocrine tumors from the dataset so that it contains only the adenocarcinoma tumor samples. stage i stage ii stage iii Cancer is present. The histology for the different tumor samples is contained in the my_data. Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide accounting for an estimated 9. Lets see the description of some variables of this data. The motive of this notebook is to explore and analyse the cancers patient based on their genes structure. The most common cancers are Lung 2.
