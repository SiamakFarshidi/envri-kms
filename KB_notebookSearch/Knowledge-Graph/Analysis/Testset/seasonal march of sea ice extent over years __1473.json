Feb Sep Upper panel months of sea ice extent maxima Lower panel months of sea ice extent mimina Observations Arctic Northern hemisphere sea ice has a robust decreasing trend in both February maximum extent and September minimum extent. As the variation of sea ice extent is small within a month the monthly mean would be used in the following analysis. Comparing the rates of change between the hemisphere the Arctic sea ice is shrinking at a much faster rate than the weak increase in Antarctic sea ice. Antarctic Southern hemisphere sea ice does exactly the opposite. Clear decreasing trend of Arctic sea ice extent monthly mean in August to October is observed. linear algebra data processing CSV file I O e. xticks rotation 60. range over the years Observations Arctic Northern hemisphere sea ice has maximum extent in February and minimum extent in September. Antarctic Southern hemisphere sea ice has a weakly increasing trend in both February minimum extent and September maximum extent. Seasonal March of Sea Ice Extent during 1979 2015This notebook explores how the seasonal variations of sea ice extents have changed during 1979 2015. The minimum sea ice extent annually for the Arctic is decreasing at a rate of 8 x 10 4 sq km year.
