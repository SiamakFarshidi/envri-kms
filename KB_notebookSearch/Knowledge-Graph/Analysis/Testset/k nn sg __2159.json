It is performed during the data pre processing to handle highly varying magnitudes or values or units Min Max Normalization This technique re scales a feature or observation value with distribution value 0 and 1 Standardization It is a very effective technique which re scales a feature value so that it has distribution with 0 mean value and variance equals to 1. Look at the classification metric. Min Max is often preferred as it maintains the shape of the distributionSplitting data into training and testing sets Fitting the model image. 4 Optimal value of K 2. Build kNN with 15 neighbors. A test on diffrent values of k also has been performed. Contents Getting Started 1 Importing the Libraries 1. png attachment image. Setting up the input and output variable Scaling the data Feature Scaling is a technique to standardize the independent features present in the data in a fixed range. 5 Getting Started Here we describe importing the library impoting the datset and some basic checks on the dataset Importing the Libraries Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate FNA of a breast mass. 2 Fitting the model 2 Setting up the input and the output variable 2. 1 ID number2 Diagnosis M malignant B benign 3 32 Importing and Inspecting the Data 30 42 38 74 89 30 38 42 74 89 image.
