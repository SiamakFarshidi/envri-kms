Virtual writing tutors and automated writing systems can leverage these algorithms while teachers may use them to reduce grading time. IntroductionAbout CompitionIn this competition you ll identify elements in student writing. Label Defination Lead an introduction that begins with a statistic a quotation a description or some other device to grab the reader s attention and point toward the thesis Position an opinion or conclusion on the main question Claim a claim that supports the position Counterclaim a claim that refutes another claim or gives an opposing reason to the position Rebuttal a claim that refutes a counterclaim Evidence ideas or examples that support claims counterclaims or rebuttals. Lets read both of them. More specifically you will automatically segment texts and classify argumentative and rhetorical elements in essays written by 6th 12th grade students. You ll have access to the largest dataset of student writing ever released in order to test your skills in natural language processing a fast growing area of data science. We have train csv and train folder which contains multiple text files. Lets understand the columns and labels of the data. VisualizationOrignal Code Source HereWork in Progress for numerical computation and dataframe for importing all the text files in the directory style for spacy. Concluding a concluding statement that restates the claims Lets import the datasets and all the files. If successful you ll make it easier for students to receive feedback on their writing and increase opportunities to improve writing outcomes.
