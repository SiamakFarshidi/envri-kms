This notebook is inspired from the great kernel Keras U net starter LB 0. de people ronneber u net u net architecture. Get the data Downsample both the training and test images to reduce computations Retain record of the original sizes of the test images to upsample predicted masks and create correct run length encodings Visualize imported data Build and train our neural networkNext we build our U Net model loosely based on U Net Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation https arxiv. png Make predictions Encode and submit our results Link https www. Iterate over the test IDs and generate run length encodings for each seperate mask identified by skimage. Create submission Set some parameters Get train and test IDs Get and resize train images and masks Read image files iteratively Append image to numpy array for train dataset Read corresponding mask files iteratively Looping through masks Read individual masks Expand individual mask dimensions Overlay individual masks to create a final mask for corresponding image Append mask to numpy array for train dataset Get and resize test images Read images iteratively Get test size Resize image to match training data Append image to numpy array for test dataset Check if training data looks all right Build U Net model Fit model Predict on train val and test Threshold predictions Create list of upsampled test masks Perform a sanity check on some random training samples Perform a sanity check on some random validation samples Run length encoding stolen from https www. pdf and very similar to this repo https github.
