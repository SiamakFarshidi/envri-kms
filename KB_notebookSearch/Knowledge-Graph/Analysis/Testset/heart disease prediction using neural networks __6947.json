After these steps model success increased. Importing the DatasetThe dataset is available through the University of California Irvine Machine learning repository. One of these kernels is the source https github. to what is called the L1 norm of the weights. Building and Training the Neural NetworkNow that we have our data fully processed and split into training and testing datasets we can begin building a neural network to solve this classification problem. Furthermore for the machine learning side of this project we will be using sklearn and keras. The important thing here is the need to do these steps. Don t let the different name confuse you weight decay is mathematically the exact same as L2 regularization. A simple model in this context is a model where the distribution of parameter values has less entropy or a model with fewer parameters altogether as we saw in the section above. to what is called the L2 norm of the weights. L2 regularization where the cost added is proportional to the square of the value of the weights coefficients i. To data all published studies using this data focus on a subset of 14 attributes so we will do the same. You can find many kernels on the page of Fran\u00e7ois Chollet Github the author of the book. Let s test the performance of both our categorical model and binary model. read the csv print the shape of the DataFrame so we can see how many examples we have print the last twenty or so data points remove missing data indicated with a drop rows with NaN values from DataFrame print the shape and data type of the dataframe transform data to numeric to enable further analysis print data characteristics usings pandas built in describe function plot histograms for each variable create X and Y datasets for training convert the data to categorical labels define a function to build the keras model create model compile model fit the model to the training data Model accuracy Model Losss convert into binary classification problem heart disease or no heart disease define a new keras model for binary classification create model Compile model fit the binary model on the training data Model accuracy Model Losss generate classification report using predictions for categorical model generate classification report using predictions for binary model generate classification report using predictions for binary model. Create Training and Testing Datasets 2. The network might be able to automatically adapt to such heterogeneous data but it would definitely make learning more difficult. Here is the result https iili. Adding Weight Regularization You may be familiar with Occam s Razor principle given two explanations for something the explanation most likely to be correct is the simplest one the one that makes the least amount of assumptions. Improving Results A Binary Classification Problem 4. setting to zero a number of output features of the layer during training. Let s simplify the problem by converting the data to a binary classification problem heart disease or no heart disease. Since this is a categorical classification problem we will use a softmax activation function in the final layer of our network and a categorical_crossentropy loss during our training phase. Importing the Dataset 1. Here is the URL http archive. Dropout applied to a layer consists of randomly dropping out i. Let s get started 2. 2020 I applied a few steps to this kernel that I learned from the book Deep Learning with Python. Based on attributes such as blood pressure cholestoral levels heart rate and other characteristic attributes patients will be classified according to varying degrees of coronary artery disease. Import these libraries using the cell below to ensure you have them correctly installed. Thus a common way to mitigate overfitting is to put constraints on the complexity of a network by forcing its weights to only take small values which makes the distribution of weight values more regular. edu ml datasets Heart DiseaseThis dataset contains patient data concerning heart disease diagnosis that was collected at several locations around the world. Heart Disease Prediction using Neural NetworksThis project will focus on predicting heart disease using neural networks. This also applies to the models learned by neural networks given some training data and a network architecture there are multiple sets of weights values multiple models that could explain the data and simpler models are less likely to overfit than complex ones. Create Training and Testing DatasetsNow that we have preprocessed the data appropriately we can split it into training and testings datasets. This could be because it is very difficult to distinguish between the different severity levels of heart disease classes 1 4. We will be using some common Python libraries such as pandas numpy and matplotlib. Machine learning and artificial intelligence is going to have a dramatic impact on the health field as a result familiarizing yourself with the data processing techniques appropriate for numerical health data and the most widely used algorithms for classification tasks is an incredibly valuable use of your time In this tutorial we will do exactly that. Results and Metrics 5. More specifically we will use the data collected at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. L2 regularization is also called weight decay in the context of neural networks. 4 overfitting and underfitting. Adding Dropout Dropout is one of the most effective and most commonly used regularization techniques for neural networks developed by Hinton and his students at the University of Toronto. Building and Training the Neural Network 3. Using keras we will define a simple neural network with one hidden layer. This is called weight regularization and it is done by adding to the loss function of the network a cost associated with having large weights. To import the necessary data we will use pandas built in read_csv function. We will use Sklearn s train_test_split function to generate a training dataset 80 percent of the total data and testing dataset 20 percent of the total data. To do this we will make predictions on the training dataset and calculate performance metrics using Sklearn. com fchollet deep learning with python notebooks blob master 4. Improving Results A Binary Classification ProblemAlthough we achieved promising results we still have a fairly large error. ipynb Steps Added Stratified Train Test split in scikit learn Normalization It would be problematic to feed into a neural network values that all take wildly different ranges. Results and MetricsThe accuracy results we have been seeing are for the training data but what about the testing dataset If our model s cannot generalize to data that wasn t used to train them they won t provide any utility. A widespread best practice to deal with such data is to do feature wise normalization for each feature in the input data a column in the input data matrix we will subtract the mean of the feature and divide by the standard deviation so that the feature will be centered around 0 and will have a unit standard deviation. This cost comes in two flavors L1 regularization where the cost added is proportional to the absolute value of the weights coefficients i. This project will utilize a dataset of 303 patients and distributed by the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
