We will need to differentiate between pneumonia opacities and other lung conditions that can create signals such as fluid overload bleeding volume loss lung cancer post radiation or surgical changes and fluid in the pleural space. It would be helpful to recalculate the centroid in relation to each lung after segmentation.

The sample submission file will show us the format that we should be using for our competition submission after we have created our predictions. There are 28 989 rows with two columns.

A more detailed explanation can be found on the challenge s evaluation page https www. This line below counts up each patientId s number of occurrences and then counts up how many have each number of occurrences. We ve loaded the data explored the files included examined images to help us understand our goals and to brainstorm approaches and run the provided model on the data to create our first submission file. Goals To classify pneumonia in medical images we will build an algorithm that detects lung opacities.

Many control images with no pneumonia opacity or with other lung conditions are also present with which to train. Got it So 3062 patients are represented twice 105 thrice and 11 four times. Dear Kagglers This kernel is intended to help beginners who are overwhelmed by this project get up and running. Let s first look at the csv files in order. First we will briefly discuss the challenge. We hope to provide a basic understanding of the data and how to work with it to make predictions that can be submitted to the competition.

One thing we notice about those is that the have a large quantity of black pixels resulting from the cropping. Examine Files We will start by listing the files included in the project. We ve adapted some and used others as is and explained the code behind them for this tutorial. Classes How many of the patients have pneumonia compared to those that don t How many bounding boxes designating a pneumonia opacity are present in each image What is the age distribution by gender and target What are the areas of the bounding boxes by gender Here we see that females have smaller sized pneumonia bounding boxes.

We use Python s multiprocessing package to accelerate the speed of these tasks. This will be done by training machine learning models on a set of images that have been labeled by experts to show a box drawn around the presumed pneumonia lung opacity or opacities when present. Introduction Project Overview Goals2. Project Overview Numerous advances in medicine have been accomplished through the use of machine learning on medical imagery. A successful algorithm will be able to take unlabeled images and label them accurately by drawing a box around pneumonia lung opacities. This is possible because females generally have lung volumes that are 10 12 less than that of males https www. Some contain pneumonia opacities and others contain other conditions. This tells us we do NOT want to include the row index counters on our submission. A more detailed definition of the of the competition is provided on the Kaggle RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge website https www. com c rsna pneumonia detection challenge evaluation.

The information we are most interested in at this point are the patient s sex and age the view position of the image PA for posterior anterior or AP for anterior posterior the image pixel spacing and of course the image itself which is contained in the Pixel Data array. com ashishpatel26 chexnet radiologist level pneumonia detection NASNet https www.
