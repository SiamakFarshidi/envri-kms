Let s save the data we will return and load it later. The King of the World a. News network and meme flow So far we have extracted a timestamped list of links between pages that have mentioned the lipstick on a pig in any form. Note the amount of nodes pointing exclusively to themselves these do not add up much to the model as well. NB You can also install Snap. There are two types of media these pages belong to blogs encoded as B and mainstream media labeled as M. TNEANet is an alternative data structure that supports multiple attributed edges. com article politicsnews idusn2944356420080901 pagenumber 1 virtualbrandchannel 10112 L http cbn. The Ultimate Alien Ass Kicker could take care of them. Problem understandingPhony stuff circulating all over the Make News Media has sparked outrage in an alien civiliation that observed humanity since the very good old times and invasion troops landed on Earth. Pay attention to multiple dangling nodes those with zero degree pages that contain a quote and have no outgoing links do not add that much structurally to the model. QtStr phrase string. Problem understandingB. First we look into keyword clusters phrases mutate and the original quote you can put lipstick on a pig but it s still a pig has multiple variants. Let s establish connections between pages. net dukenukem images 2 2d Pigcop. py uses two default engines for plotting GraphViz GnuPlotFormer is a part of standard Python environment on Kaggle while latter has to be set up separately enable Internet access in order to do so.

Each block of the data has the following structure A B C ClSz number of different phrases in the cluster number of B records. Next time we are going to look into statistics of graphs their meaning applications and try to answer the question whether or not news propagate on Internet at random. Why SNAP Why here Why now 1.

Extra mile Some ideas for you to implement and have fun with the given data Remove Suprematist comments from the code above see cells In 15 and In 17 and enjoy faster processing of figures and variability of graph statistics between purges at cost of excluding disconnected nodes and self edges from the model. Once we have constructed the first straightforward projection of the data into graph G_1 let s look into it s statistics Note the difference in numbers we see 1092 links in the dataframe dfL and 969 unique directed links in G_1 The data structure at hand TNGraph directed graph single directed edge between an ordered pair of nodes does not allow for parallel edges. Luckily data comes preprocessed. com politicalpunch 2008 09 obama says mc 1. aspx L http voices. Prior runs celebrated cs231n Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition.

Check environment and files Step 1. 6 on Linux it is a good time to get started here on Kaggle. Subsequent dramatic drop in lipstick sales suggests that the root cause somewhat relates to the phrase you can put lipstick on a pig but it s still a pig Hordes of heavily armed hogs marching city streets only reinforce the first grieve guesses.

We have timed records of page publication those with hyperlinks to other pages URLs and they correspond to nodes in a graph that is going to be our model formally Let G_1 denote a directed graph where each web page URL is encoded as a node N_i in N_i.

On top of that we members of the Open Data Science community have a tradition of going through Stanford classes after each run of the Open Machine Learning Course as a bonus track for survivors keen to focus on something specific. Also let s explore the standard output one with uncolored nodes and reduce Data Ink ratio. the Google Algorithm a probability of random walker visiting certain page and highlight top 10 nodes those most likely to get a visit from a web surfer because other well referred pages point to them. Let s explore those. SNAP comes with multiple hash types for mapping between data types. py on KaggleWe keep installation files downloaded from Snap. Example network exploration news propagation on Internet1. In order to do so we shade all nodes that belong elsewhere except for the biggest weakly connected component a set of nodes that would be connected via some path if we view our graph as undirected and a strongly connected component one that considers connectivity through directed edges. All you need is to add a line from the snippet below to your kernel apt get y install gnuplot qq dev nullKeep in mind that visualzation of a graph containing more than 1000 nodes takes some time.
