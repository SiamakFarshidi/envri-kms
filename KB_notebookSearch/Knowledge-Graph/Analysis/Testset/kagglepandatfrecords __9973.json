These markings are not part of the tissue but were made by the pathologists who originally checked this case. graph_objs we can make an interactive viewer that works inside a notebook. The label information is stored in the red R channel the other channels are set to zero and can be ignored. The dataset consists of around 11. Note scikit image 0. Loading image regions patchesWith OpenSlide we can easily extract patches from the slide from arbitrary locations. org project tifffile as the backend. These pen markings are available on some slides in the training set. Loading a slideLoading a slide with scikit image https scikit image. Want to interactively view a slide We have added an interactive viewer Interactive viewer for slides to this notebook in the last section. Biopsies can contain a mix of cancerous and healthy tissue. Intermediate levels can be created by downsampling a higher resolution level. Note that eventhough a biopsy contains cancer not all epithelial tissue has to be cancerous. fit train_x_img train_x_mask 0 epochs 1 steps_per_epoch 5 validation_steps 2 validation_data test_x_img test_x_mask 0 Location of the training images Parse the input tf. Some things you can notice The image dimensions are quite large typically between 5. read_region function. As the label information is in the R channel other channels can be discarded. org api python Loading a slideBefore we can load data from a slide we need to open it. Interactive viewer for slidesUsing Plotly https kite. MultiImage class this class gives the ability to access the individual levels of the image. Using OpenSlide to load the dataIn the following sections we will load data from the slides with OpenSlide https openslide. Please refer to the OpenSlide Loading label masks section for more information about the contents of the label masks. Using this viewer you can load any image from the PANDA dataset and interactively zoom in to specific regions. To more easily inspect the masks we map the int labels to RGB colors using a color palette. This rotation has no clinical value and is only dependent on how the biopsy was collected in the lab. org api python openslide. Quickstart reading a patch in 4 linesThe example below shows in 4 lines how to extract a patch from one of the slides using OpenSlide. Valid values 0 background non tissue or unknown 1 benign tissue stroma and epithelium combined 2 cancerous tissue stroma and epithelium combined The label masks of Radboudumc were semi automatically generated by several deep learning algorithms contain noise and can be considered as weakly supervised labels. close For this tutorial we created a small function to show some basic information about a slide. To do this we load both the mask and the biopsy and merge them using PIL. If you prefer something like matplotlib you can also use plt. 000 whole slide images WSI of prostate biopsies from Radboud University Medical Center and the Karolinska Institute. Loading label masksLoading label masks using scikit image is similar to loading the slides. Make sure tifffile is installed before running the examples below. Visualizing masks using matplotlib Given that the masks are just integer matrices you can also use other packages to display the masks. Tip Want to view the slides in a more interactive way Using a WSI viewer you can interactively view the slides. Running the cell below loads four example biopsies using OpenSlide. This requirement is already met when running this code in a notebook on Kaggle. Mask data is present in the R channel To show the masks we map the raw label values to RGB values Mapping 0 background 1 stroma 2 benign epithelium 3 Gleason 3 4 Gleason 4 5 Gleason 5 Mapping 0 background 1 benign 2 cancer Compute microns per pixel openslide gives resolution in centimeters Optional create a custom color map Load data from the highest level Mask data is present in the R channel Create alpha mask Mapping 0 background 1 stroma 2 benign epithelium 3 Gleason 3 4 Gleason 4 5 Gleason 5 Mapping 0 background 1 benign 2 cancer Deleting the object frees up memory You can also visualize patches with matplotlib Free up memory invisible trace to init axes and to support autoresize Set background image plotly now performs auto conversion of PIL image to png data URI Below is a workaround which rounds image requests to multiples of 4 once the libpixman fix is in place these can be removed Nasty workaround for buggy container Letting PIL do the resize is faster than plotly Update with batch_update so all updates happen simultaneously. Print the case level label Generate a small image thumbnail Read in the mask data from the highest level We cannot use thumbnail here because we need to load the raw label data. Note In the example below you can also observe a few pen markings on the slide dark green smudges. The benefit of OpenSlide is that we can load arbitrary regions of the slide without loading the whole image in memory. x will be a numpy array with the contents of the input to the tf. pythonbiopsy openslide. Because the image is already in memory this boils down to a slice on the numpy array. OpenSlide path do someting with the slide herebiopsy. Using scikit image tifffile to load the dataAs an alternative to OpenSlide the slides in the PANDA dataset can also be loaded using scikit image https scikit image. Using the level argument we can easily load in data from any level that is present in the slide. Biopsies can be in different rotations. Valid values are 0 background non tissue or unknown 1 stroma connective tissue non epithelium tissue 2 healthy benign epithelium 3 cancerous epithelium Gleason 3 4 cancerous epithelium Gleason 4 5 cancerous epithelium Gleason 5 Karolinska Regions are labelled. There are two ways to load the data from the PANDA dataset Option 1 Load images using openslide Option 2 Load images using skimage requires that tifffile is installed General packages Plotly for the interactive viewer see last section Create a dictionary describing the features. If you use Qupath and the images do not load try changing the file extension to. imshow to directly show a mask without converting it to an RGB image. Each slide has 3 levels you can load corresponding to a downsampling of 1 4 and 16. Visualizing the masks using PIL Using a small helper function we can display some basic information about a mask. Note The code below only works when you run this notebook yourself. The images in the PANDA dataset are relatively small because each biopsy was individually extracted from the source slide. 000 pixels in both x and y. imread Loading image regionsSimilar to OpenSlide we can extract regions from the whole image. These masks directly indicate which parts of the tissue are healthy and which are cancerous. This overlay can help you identifying the different growth patterns. You can read more about the OpenSlide python bindings in the documentation https openslide. By default MultiImage tries to conserve memory usage by only caching the last image level that was accessed. Loading label masksApart from the slide level label present in the csv file almost all slides in the training set have an associated mask with additional label information. The first mask is from Radboudumc and shows two different grades of cancer shown in yellow and orange. The second mask is from Karolinska the region that contains cancer is higlighted in red. html highlight multiimage skimage. Additionally this function display a small thumbnail of the slide. This is different from Openslide that always works with coordinates from level 0. html highlight imread skimage. org is similar to loading slides with OpenSlide. The output is not shown when purely viewing the notebook as it requires access to the source image. If you are only interested in the lowest level highest magnification you can also load level 0 using imread https scikit image. As with the slides itself the label masks can be opened using OpenSlide. The small size makes it possible to load the slides directly into memory. For example using matplotlib and a custom color map we can quickly visualize the different cancer regions Overlaying masks on the slidesAs the masks have the same dimension as the slides we can overlay the masks on the tissue to directly see which areas are cancerous. Coordinates passed to read_region are always relative to level 0 the highest resolution. This internal version does not support JPEG compression and can not be used to load the images in the dataset. The label masks of Karolinska were semi autotomatically generated based on annotations by a pathologist. To extract a certain region of the image you will need to load the whole image at one of the levels. Loading a specific region is done using the read_region https openslide. Still upon loading the image is uncompressed resulting in larger memory usage. The cells below shows two example masks from the dataset. Getting started with the PANDA datasetThis notebook shows a few methods to load and display images from the PANDA challenge dataset. You can check the memory usage of the kernel to see that loading the lowest level can require a considerate amount of memory. The information in the masks differ from the two centers Radboudumc Prostate glands are individually labelled. After a file is open we can retrieve data from it at arbitratry positions and levels. The major difference between scikit image and OpenSlide is that scikit image loads the image into memory. Want to investigate slides locally on your machine Using a WSI viewer you can interactively view the slides on your own machine. All images in the dataset contain this metadata and you can use this in your data pipeline. To illustrate we use the same coordinates as in the OpenSlide example To load the same region from level 1 we have to devide the coordinates with the downsample factor 4 per level. At this point image data is read from the file and loaded into memory. The code below loads each individual level. Location of the training images for image mask in test print hereee Use the activations of these layers 64x64 32x32 16x16 8x8 4x4 Create the feature extraction model 4x4 8x8 8x8 16x16 16x16 32x32 32x32 64x64 Downsampling through the model Upsampling and establishing the skip connections This is the last layer of the model 64x64 128x128 model_history model. Location of the training images Location of training labels Open the image does not yet read the image into memory Read a specific region of the image starting at upper left coordinate x 17800 y 19500 on level 0 and extracting a 256 256 pixel patch. com computationalpathologygroup ASAP and QuPath https qupath. This viewer is a great way of inspecting the data in more detail. OpenSlide gives the resolution in centimeters so we convert this to microns. The label masks are stored in an RGB format so that they can be easily opened by image readers. Example proto using the dictionary above. There are noticable color differences between the biopsies this is very common within pathology and is caused by different laboratory procedures. function Parse the input tf. Slides are loaded using the MultiImage https scikit image. Examples of open source viewers that can open the PANDA dataset are ASAP https github. com python docs plotly. Display the image Close the opened slide after use Generate a small image thumbnail Here we compute the pixel spacing the physical size of a pixel in the image. After opening the slide we can for example load a 512x512 patch from the lowest level level 0 at a specific coordinate. x uses an internal version of the tif loader if the tifffile packages is not installed. The dimensions of each level differ based on the dimensions of the original image. org with tifffile https pypi.
