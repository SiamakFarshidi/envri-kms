Understanding Boxplot Boxplots Following the above Boxplot we could translate this representation of data into medians to see the average of minimum nights per room type. Next we put good use of our latitude and longitude columns and used to create a geographical heatmap color coded by the price of listings. 4 following by Brooklyn 180 km\u00b2 41. org open source BSD licensed library providing high performance easy to use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language to Python data structures such a lists tuples dictionaries. Canned report is one that has been designed before and has information around a given subject. org wiki Pearson_correlation_coefficient which does Compute pairwise correlation of columns excluding NA null values to get the measure of the linear correlation between two variables X and Y. It addresses your basic HOW MANY WHEN WHERE and WHAT questions. index more faster than airbnb airbnb. Dropping the column last review as more than 10 000 data points contains null values. Define project Define the project outcomes deliverable scope of the effort business goals identify the data sets that are going to be used. Each separate system may also use a different data organization and or format. Matrix Correlation Table Visualization HeatMap Correlation VisualizationWe applied the Pearson Coefficient of Correlation https en. It s obviously that all the people who rent an Airbnb prefer an entire home Percentage Representation of Neighbourhood Group in Pie Neighbourhoods grouped by Neighbourhood Group in BarChart Given this graphic outputs we finally can see that the most rented neighbourhood group is Manhattan 59 1 km\u00b2 44. They re useful for obtaining more in depth information about a specific query. The most common metrics are Mean Median Standard Deviation Variance Proportion Mode Range Quintile s Rank. Statistics Statistical Analysis enables to confirm the assumptions hypothesis and test them using standard statistical models. ETL Process ETL Process Extraction Extraction Transformation Cleaning Transformation Cleaning Load Load 3. MetricsMetrics are measures of quantitative assessment commonly used for assessing comparing and tracking performance or production. drop last_review axis 1 inplace True airbnb. Gradient Boosted Regressor ModelGradient Boosted GB builds an additive model in a forward stage wise fashion it allows for the optimization of arbitrary differentiable loss functions. Staten Island averages around 50 800. This provides a complete view of customer interactions. Deployment Predictive model deployment provides the option to deploy the analytical results into everyday decision making process to get results reports and output by automating the decisions based on the modelling. Number of reviews grouped by Host IdWe already have the top host_id s with more number of reviews of the dataset now we are going to print out the names that belongs to each host_id Diagnostic AnalysisDiagnostic data analytics is the process of examining data to understand cause and event or why something happened. 409 following bythe Private Room and Shared Room with 22. Also hosts that take good advantage of the Airbnb platform and provide the most listings we found that our top host has 327 listings. Since 2008 guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present more unique personalized way of experiencing the world. Distribution Price by Neighbourhood Groups As we can see in our grid of distribution plots we already have the data distributed by price and splitted by Neighbourhood group so according to the plot above we finally can determinate that Brooklyn averages around 70 500 per night depending upon the neighbourhood. read_csv 2D Plotting Library Python Data Visualization Library based on matplotlib Python Geospatial Data Library Interactive Graphing Library for Python Input data files are available in the. Types of Loading Initial Load populating all the Data Warehouse tables Incremental Load applying ongoing changes as when needed periodically. Most data warehousing projects combine data from different source systems. Ad hoc reports however are designed by you and usually aren t scheduled but are more in the moment. Finally getting this results Room Type Minimum Q1 Q2 Median Q3 Q4 Maximum Private Room 0 2 2 2 3 3 6 Entire home apt 0 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 7 Shared Room 0 2 2 3 We could come up with the idea that if we d like to rent a long term Airbnb we should go into an entire home or apartment if s not we always can get a shared room. org wiki Mean_squared_error Mean squared error regression loss or mean squared deviation MSD of an estimator of a procedure for estimating an unobserved quantity measures the average of the squares of the errors that is the average squared difference between the estimated values and the actual value. Data analysis has multiple facets and approaches encompassing diverse techniques under a variety of names and is used in different business science and social science domains. converting a comma separated list specified as a string in one column into each value in different columns Disaggregation in repeating columns Looking up and validating the relevant data from tables or referential files Applying any form of data validation failed validation may result in a full rejection of the data partial rejection or no rejection at all and thus none some or all the data is handed over to the next step depending on the rule design and exception handling many of the above transformations may result in exceptions e. Once again this can be further separated into two categories ad hoc reporting and canned reports. Analysis Analysis Descriptive Anaysis Descriptive Anaysis Diagnostic Analysis Diagnostic Analysis Predictive Analysis Predictive Analysis 5. if the source system codes male as 1 and female as 2 but the warehouse codes male as M and female as F Encoding free form values e. The company s name comes from air mattress B B. org wiki Mean_absolute_error Is a measure of difference between two continuous variables. It currently covers more than 81 000 cities and 191 countries worldwide. This dataset describes the listing activity and metrics in NYC NY for 2019. Modeling Linear Regression Model Mean Squared Error https en. 0 and it can be negative because the model can be arbitrarily worse. Distribution of Airbnb s in New York City HeatMap Reference Map of Predominant household PredictionsThe Prediction process should be iterate over these steps before get a stable output prediction 1. Using Machine Learning techniques and with the power of Linear Regression Models Decisions Tree algorithms between others. For example if the source data has three columns name host_name and longitude latitude then the choice may take only name and host_name. Overall we discovered a very good number of interesting relationships between features and explained each step of the process. Lastly we got into Predictive Analysis using the latest stack technology in order to predict the price of Airbnb s over the year. dtypes bar index x coordinate of text y coordinate of text y label Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie is drawn as a circle. AnalysisData analysis is a process of inspecting cleansing transforming and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information informing conclusions and supporting decision making. Assume X and Y are variables of paired observations that express the same phenomenon. It responds to questions like WHAT HAPPENED WHY SOMETHING HAPPENED. Modelling Predictive modelling provides the ability to automatically create accurate predictive models about future. In this section we are going to introduce all needed files in this case it s going to be a CSV file where we can find the facts to work with so let s extract our raw data. For example running this by clicking run or pressing Shift Enter will list all files under the input directory Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output. PD This Bloxplot has been filtered in order to avoid an extreme and fake values from dataset like 2000 minimum nights and so on. In our case we are going to use a well formed CSV file provided by Kaggle then we ll extract all the needed data transform and clean the raw data to improve quality of this dataset and finally load this data through data science tool like Pandas https pandas. Full Refresh erasing the contents of one or more tables and reloading with fresh data. sale_amount qty unit_price Sorting or ordering the data based on a list of columns to improve search performance Splitting a column into multiple columns e. Word CloudA wordcloud or tag cloud is a visual representation of words that accomplished a text where the size is bigger for those words that appear more often. Set up the matplotlib figure Finalize the plot Parameters Filter airbnb prices for shake of the visualization Create ViolinPlot Parameters Filter minimum nights to 2 weeks 15 days nights Data Preparation BoxPlot Creation Set up the matplotlib figure Finalize the plot Data Preparation BarPlot creation Add a legend and informative axis label Show WordCloud Get list of neighbourhood Words Get list of neighbourhood Words Get list of names Words Filter data Show Interactive Plot generate an array of rainbow colors by fixing the saturation and lightness of the HSL representation of colour and marching around the hue. This public dataset is part of Airbnb and the original source can be found on this website. Spatial Analysis by Neighbourhood Groups Price Overview in a HeatMap Normalization Following the above Heatmap sequenced by price we can confirm that the most expensive airbnbs are in Manhattan neighbourhood zone which is also the more rented as we could confirm in the first plot The rest of zones are regularly proportionate and all of them have the about same price. Preprocessing and preparing Data for Prediction Load again the dataset from CSV file to avoid missing data errors or other warnings. Understanding our Data Understanding our Data 4. Or the selection mechanism may ignore all those records where price is not present price null. This type of analysis is another step up from the descriptive and diagnostic analyses. George Staten Island Kinsbridge Bronx Density and Distribution of Prices for each Neighbourhood Group According to the Density and Distribution of prices for each Neighborhood Group plot we can set up that the average of all the apartment room prices are between 50 200 but is more remarkable for the average zones like Queens Staten Island and Bronx. In our case we ll use the Initial Load since we just have one data source in this case it s a dataset in a CSV format. Introduction Abstract Introduction Abstract 2. Predictions Predictions Machine Learning Machine Learning Modeling Modeling Linear Regression Model Linear Regression Model 8. ETL ProcessIn computing extract transform load ETL is the general procedure of copying data from one or more sources into a destination system which represents the data differently from the source s or in a different context than the source s. Conclusion Conclusion Introduction Abstract Airbnb is an online marketplace that connects people who want to rent out their homes with people who are looking for accommodations in that locale. Metrics Metrics Graphs Histograms Graphs Histograms Bloxpots Bloxpots 6. csv dataset for the 2019 year appeared to be a very rich dataset with a variety of columns that allowed us to do deep data exploration on each significant column presented. First we have been processing and transforming the dataset in order to clean and refine the data with actions like dropped duplications replaced null values to standarized ones remove columns and finally applied ETL process then we analyzed from the most basics plots and graphics with visualizations like Number of Room Types Available using Bar Plots Percentage Representation of Neighbourhood Group in Pie using Pie Plot Density and Distribution of Prices for each Neighbourhood Group using Violin Plot. Before start we have to import the required libraries and frameworks in order to make this IPython Notebook works Importing Packages Check versions Print out the versions of all the packages libraries that we are going to work with LoadLoading data into the target data warehouse database is the last step of the ETL process. This data analytics is very much mimicked on a higher level on Airbnb Data Machine Learning team for better business decisions control over the platform marketing initiatives implementation of new features and much more. Semi supervised machine learning algorithms fall somewhere in between supervised and unsupervised learning since they use both labeled and unlabeled data for training typically a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. 1 and Queens 280 km\u00b2 11. The rejected data is ideally reported back to the source system for further analysis to identify and to rectify the incorrect records. Translating coded values e. In today s business world data analysis plays a role in making decisions more scientific and helping businesses run more effectively. Techniques like drill down data discovery data mining and correlations are often employed. Plotly accepts any CSS color format see e. Transformation Cleaning In the data transformation stage a series of rules or functions applied to the extracted data to prepare it for loading into the end target. Unsupervised learning studies how systems can infer a function to describe a hidden structure from unlabeled data. In a typical Data warehouse huge volume of data needs to be loaded in a relatively short period nights. For the other hand we can notice a slightly overpriced in Manhattan and Brooklyn neighborhood group with the majority of density in prices between 200 400 it s definitely a difference if you are going to get a rent in the next days and you want to save your wallet We finally decide there is a notice over cost if you d like to rent a room apartment in the Manhattan neighbourhood group between 100 600. Number of Room Types Available According to the above graphic we can see that the most rented room type is the Entire home apartment with a total count of 25. dropna Fill NA NaN values using the specified method. An intrinsic part of the extraction involves data validation to confirm whether the data pulled from the sources has the correct expected values in a given domain such as a pattern default or list of values. In many cases this represents the most important aspect of ETL since extracting data correctly sets the stage for the success of subsequent processes. Machine Learning Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence AI that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. we are going to read the complete CSV file to work with all this data as we said early. We found the most reviewed listings and analyzed some additional attributes. Data extraction involves extracting data from homogeneous or heterogeneous sources data transformation processes data by data cleansing and transforming them into a proper storage format structure for the purposes of querying and analysis finally data loading describes insertion of data into the last target database such as an working data store a data mart data lake or a data warehouse. Graphs Histograms 365 Availability group by Neighbourhood Group order by Price Scatter Graph showing Number of reviews Availability 365 per Host ID Host Name Bloxpots Data VisualizationsData visualization is the discipline of trying to understand data by placing it in a visual context so that patterns trends and correlations that might not otherwise be detected can be exposed. If the data fails the validation rules it is rejected entirely or in part. We have used Machine Learning as application of Artificial Intelligence AI and we also applied the most optimized and newest algorithms like Linear Regression Model Gradient Boosted Regressor Model where we got a positive results coming up with the generalized increase in prices in New York City. No strong correlation except number_of_reviews vs reviews_per_month Natural Processing LanguageNatural language processing NLP is a subfield of linguistics computer science information engineering and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human natural languages in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. drop reviews_per_month axis 1 inplace True airbnb. Also includes a variety of techniques many still in their early development using different analytic approaches and applied in fields as data science mathematics statistics. In a more restricted sense spatial analysis is the technique applied to structures at the human scale most notably in the analysis of geographic data. Data collection Data mining for predictive analytics prepares data from multiple sources for analysis. Predictive analysis uses the data we have summarized to make logical predictions of the outcomes of events. NYC Airbnb Data Science Project Rafael Garc\u00eda Cu\u00e9llar 10 10 20191. Organizations make use of this type of analytics as it creates more connections between data and identifies patterns of behavior. Queens averages around 60 280. In this case we ll be focus on Price Predictions in order to dive into possible future prices based on real Airbnb s price data. In contrast Unsupervised machine learning algorithms are used when the information used to train is neither classified nor labeled. R 2 coefficient of determination https en. Generate descriptive statistics that summarize the central tendency dispersion and shape of a dataset s distribution excluding NaN values. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves. The ETL process became a popular concept in the 1970s and is often used in data warehousing. org wiki Coefficient_of_determination Regression score function best possible score is 1. Machine learning algorithms are often categorized as supervised or unsupervised. Reinforcement machine learning algorithms is a learning method that interacts with its environment by producing actions and discovers errors or rewards. Also introduce of latest ML Python packages to work with like Scikit Learn Tensorflow. Number of Box Style Plot Show Background image Plotting Filter values Draw Plot ColorMaps color sequence or sequence of color optional The alpha blending value between 0 transparent and 1 opaque. In our case we are going to carry out kind of NLP to get relevant data from our text in the dataset like the names host names descriptions of Airbnb s etc. This type of analytics utilizes previous data to make predictions about future outcomes. to analyze existing data to predict unknown events of future. HeatMaps Spatial AnalysisSpatial analysis includes any of the formal techniques which study entities using their topological geometric or geographic properties. ExtractionThe first part of an ETL process involves extracting the data from the source system s. Results Results 9. Hence load process should be optimized for performance. As we can see given the last results that as much surface has the neighbourhood group doesn t mean will have the most rented zone moreover it s the smallest one For the other hand given the graphic above Neighbourhood Group splitted by Neighbourhoods we finally came up that the most rented neighbourhoods are Williamsburg Brooklyn. Supervised machine learning algorithms can apply what has been learned in the past to new data using labeled examples to predict future events. Model monitoring Models are managed and monitored to review the model performance to make sure that it is providing the results expected. Bronx averages around 50 450. when a code translation parsers an unknown code in the extracted data Checking for null values in the Airbnb dataset Filter rows using Pandas chaining Understanding our Data Dataframe Length and shape Retrieves rows based on index label Print a concise summary of a DataFrame. Data analysis Data Analysis is the process of inspecting cleaning and modelling data with the objective of discovering useful information arriving at conclusion4. We ll outline the 3 main types of data analytics Descriptive Analysis Diagnostic Analysis Predictive Analysis. In each stage a regression tree is fit on the negative gradient of the given loss function. Further we started Diagnostic Analysis section to shoe the most used tools of Data Scientists to see what happened and try to understand the past to take advantage in the future using Matrix Correlation or Natural Processing Language with Word Cloud showing us the most used words in for example the Airbnb name or reviews. Data Visualizations Data Visualizations HeatMaps Spatial Analysis HeatMaps Spatial Analysis 7. We may apply one or more of the following transformation types may be required to meet the business and technical needs of the server or data warehouse Selecting only certain columns to load or selecting null columns not to load. Neighbourhoods WordCloud Host Names WordCloud Names WordCloud Predictive AnalysisPredictive analysis is used to identify trends correlations and causation and attempts to answer the question WHAT IS LIKE TO HAPPEN. Minimum of nights by Room Type. Generally a group of metrics will typically be used to build a dashboard that management or analysts review on a regular basis to support performance assessments opinions and business strategies. After that we proceeded with analyzing boroughs and neighborhood neighborhood groups listing densities and what areas were more popular than another. There are many techniques used in Predictive Analytics such as Data mining Artificial Intelligence Machine learning Statistics and modeling etc. There are also options to choose the best solution with multi modal evaluation. Descriptive AnalysisDescriptive analytics are the backbone of reporting it s impossible to have BI tools and dashboards without it.

Cretion of Leaflet map Fit label encoder Transform labels to normalized encoding. For our data exploration purposes it also would be nice to have couple extra features such as positive and negative numeric 0 5 stars reviews or 0 5 star average review for each listing addition of these features would help to find the best reviewed hosts for NYC along with number_of_review column that is provided. Trial and error search and delayed reward are the most relevant characteristics of reinforcement learning. Predictive Analytics has different stages such as Data Modelling Data Collection Statistics and Deployment whereas Data Science has stages of Data Extraction Data Processing and Data Transformations to obtain some useful information out of it.
