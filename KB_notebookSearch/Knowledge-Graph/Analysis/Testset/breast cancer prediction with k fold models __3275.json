Describes a uniform texture of the nucleus seen in benign cells. Benign cells tend to be grouped in monolayers while cancerous cells are often grouped in multilayers. Cancer cells tend to vary in size and shape. It is related to the uniformity mentioned above. Benign non cancerous or malignant cancerous lump in a breastImporting LibrariesLet s Drop Sample Code Number as it is irrelevantCheck Whether Our DATA is clean or not So Our DATA is Clean For Our Convenience Let s change 2 and 4 to 0 and 1 Ploting GIVEN DATAFinding Out Correlation SPLITING Data in INPUT AND OUTPUT Scaling Our DataWe are going to scale our INPUT data using Standard Scaler Using K fold cross validation Technique This technique involves randomly dividing the dataset into k groups or folds of approximately equal size. Cancer cells tend to lose this ability. That is why these parameters are valuable in determining whether the cells are cancerous or not. normal_nucleoli 1 10. Nucleoli are small structures seen in the nucleus. Class 0 or 1. Uniformity of cell size shape Cancer cells tend to vary in size and shape. Epithelial cells that are significantly enlarged may be a malignant cell. bland_chromatin 1 10. In normal cells the nucleolus is usually very small if visible at all. png The main Resason we are using this technique is Our Data is less 683 rows We Don t Want that our training model mug up our data Logistic Regression with K fold cross validation Finding out average of all folds in Logistic Regression Decision Tree Classifier with K fold cross validationFinding out average of all folds in Decision Tree Classifier Random Forest Classifier with K fold cross validation Finding out average of all folds in Random Forest Classifier Conclusion So the best fit classifier is Random Forest Classifier with K fold cross validation with accuracy of 97. marginal_adhesion 1 10. Cancer is essentially a disease of uncontrolled mitosis. Breast Cancer Prediction With K fold cross validation Technique and Different Classification Models https www. cell_size_uniformity 1 10. So the loss of adhesion is a sign of malignancy. This is a term used for nuclei not surrounded by cytoplasm the rest of the cell. In cancer cells the chromatin tends to be more coarse. single_epithelial_cell_size 1 10. The first fold is kept for testing and the model is trained on k 1 folds. mitoses 1 10. com images breast cancer analysis. DATA SET clump_thickness 1 10. Those are typically seen in benign tumors. Normal cells tend to stick together. jpeg INTRODUCTIONOut AIM is to classify whether a lump in a breast could be malignant cancerous or benign non cancerous from the given DATA SET by using K fold cross validation Techniques and Clasification Models then find out the Best model. com max 680 1 M9amI9hGx45i9k5ORS6b8w. cell_shape_uniformity 1 10.
