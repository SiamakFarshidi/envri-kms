Brain tumor AboutA brain tumor is a collection or mass of abnormal cells in your brain. Pituitary tumors occur in pituitary gland responsible for growth of the body. Image Processing Convert Images to Numpy arrays Scale the arrays Plots of some training samples Class frequency distribution Synthetic Minority Oversampling Glioma tumor Meningioma tumor and Pituitary tumor almost same number of datasets ie. The skull which encloses the brain is very rigid and hence when the tumors grow inside the brain they put pressure on the skull and can lead serious damages. But the label no_tumor has only 395 samples. It accounts for 85 90 of all Central Nervous System tumors. StatisticsA brain tumor is considered one of the most aggresive diseases among children and adults. Every year about 11 700 people are diagnosed with brain tumor. Best technique to diagnose for brain tumor is Magnetic Resource Imaging MRI. 826 822 and 827 respectively. Since the number of samples for no_tumor class is less let s oversample that class using SMOTE from imblearn package. What a brain tumor looks like Types of Brain tumor Glioma Occurs at the base of the brain. Images of test samples Model creation and training Use ImageDataGenerator for image data augmentation Model implementation Prediction create arrays. The 5 year survival rate with a cancerous brain tumor is approximately 34 in men and 36 in women. Meningioma tumor grows from meninges layers of tissue covering the brain and the spinal cord.
