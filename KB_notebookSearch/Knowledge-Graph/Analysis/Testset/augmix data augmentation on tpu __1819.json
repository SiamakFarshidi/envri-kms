Otherwise build lut from the full histogram and step and then index from it. convert degrees to radians define rotation matrix For each pixel in the image select the pixel if the value is less than the threshold. For optimal performance reading from multiple files at once and Diregarding data order. is there any better way than manually typing all of these conditions I tried to randomly select transformation from array of functions but tensorflow didn t let me to you can play with these parameters level of transformations as described above in transformations integer from 1 to 10 number of different chains of transformations to be mixed number of transformations in one chain 1 means random from 1 to 3 get sample level of strength of transformations from 1 to 10. Interpolate Interpolation means we always stay within 0 and 255. Otherwise subtract 255 from the pixel. Translate shear and rotate augmentations are based on this notebook https www. A possibly cheaper version can be done using cumsum unique_with_counts over the histogram values rather than iterating over the entire image. com mgornergoogle custom training loop with 100 flowers on tpu Optimized custom training loop I encountered significant memory issues what made it pretty useless for the competetition and thus I did not include this loss function. Extrapolate We need to clip and then cast. ReadMeThis is my attempt to implement AugMix https arxiv. For the purposes of computing the step filter out the nonzeros. This is done in the C code for image. Shift lut prepending with 0. string means bytestring shape means single element returns a dataset of image label pairs tf. No parameters necessary if TPU_NAME environment variable is set. Order does not matter since we will be shuffling the data anyway disable order increase speed automatically interleaves reads from multiple files use data as soon as it streams in rather than in its original order returns a dataset of image label pairs if labeled True or image id pair if labeld False numpy and matplotlib defaults binary string in this case these are image ID strings data auto squaring this will drop data that does not fit into square or square ish rectangle size and spacing display magic formula tested to work from 1x1 to 10x10 images input image is one image of size dim dim 3 not a batch of b dim dim 3 fix for size 331 ROTATE DESTINATION PIXELS ONTO ORIGIN PIXELS FIND ORIGIN PIXEL VALUES Do addition in float. Clip the counts to be in range. Configuration Dataset functions Data visualization functions Data augmentation Helper functions TransformationsThese are simple augmentations used by AugMix. png Above image is from original paper. In this notebook I implemented data augmentation part whichs seems to be working well. Compute the histogram of the image channel. Every function takes image and level integer from 1 to 10 as arguments. visualization of augmix https i. Works on CPU and single GPU. com cdeotte rotation augmentation gpu tpu 0 96. For each pixel in the image less than threshold we add addition amount to it and then clip the pixel value to be between 0 and 255. While experimenting with custom implementation of this loss using optimized training loop from this notebook https www. default distribution strategy in Tensorflow. AugMix utilizes simple augmentation operations which are stochastically sampled and layered to produce a high diversity of augmented images. The value of addition is between 128 and 128. The second one indicates how much variation will particular transformation yield in other words how strong it will be. Assumes RGB for now. string means bytestring shape means single element class is missing this competitions s challenge is to predict flower classes for the test dataset returns a dataset of image s Read from TFRecords. pdfThis is also my first contact with tensorflow micro project so if you spot any errors and mistakes please report in the comments section. to compute mins and maxes. you can list the bucket with gsutil ls GCS_DS_PATH available image sizes predictions on this dataset should be submitted for the competition 00 09 10 19 20 29 30 39 40 49 50 59 60 69 70 79 80 89 90 99 100 102 convert image to floats in 0 1 range explicit size needed for TPU tf. However AugMix performs better when used with special loss function Jensen Shannon Divergence Consistency Loss. Compute the cumulative sum shifting by step 2 and then normalization by step. AugMix Visualization Transformations Original Translate Shear Rotate Solarize Solarize Add Posterize Autocontrast Contrast Equalize Brightness Color AugMix More AugMix Detect hardware return appropriate distribution strategy TPU detection. If step is zero return the original image. Scale the image making the lowest value 0 and the highest value 255. On Kaggle this is always the case.
