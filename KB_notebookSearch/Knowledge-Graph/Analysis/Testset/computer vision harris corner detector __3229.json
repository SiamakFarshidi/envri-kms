Call this its Harris value. Uniqueness can be measured by shifting each window by a small amount in a given direction and measuring the amount of change that occurs in the pixel values. com max 359 0 piogPZ 2vaYuDQiG. So the values of these eigenvalues decide whether a region is a corner edge or flat. com max 648 0 YORAyROLRUYkqxlq. More formally we take the sum squared difference SSD of the pixel values before and after the shift and identifying pixel windows where the SSD is large for shifts in all 8 directions. Find all pixels that exceed a certain threshold and are the local maxima within a certain window to prevent redundant dupes of features For each pixel that meets the criteria in 5 compute a feature descriptor. Applying Taylor Expansion to the above equation and using some mathematical steps we get the final equation as https miro. jpg \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 are the eigenvalues of M. com max 713 0 PPJxP5y_k4GCWLBM. com max 605 0 6i w 2n7p5Gxs6cv. A score R is calculated for each window https miro. When R is large which happens when \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 are large and \u03bb1 \u03bb2 the region is a corner. Corner Corner can be interpreted as the junction of two edges where an edge is a sudden change in image brightness Corner are important features in image generally termed as interest point https miro. That means we have to maximize the second term. jpg So the equation now becomes https miro. jpg High level pseudocode Take the grayscale of the original image Apply a Gaussian filter to smooth out any noise Apply Sobel operator to find the x and y gradient values for every pixel in the grayscale image For each pixel p in the grayscale image consider a 3 3 window around it and compute the corner strength function. Let us define the change function E u v as the sum of all the sum squared differences SSD where u v are the x y coordinates of every pixel in our 3 x 3 window and I is the intensity value of the pixel. com max 350 0 TcmYywgDfz3lkN8v. The features in the image are all pixels that have large values of E u v as defined by some threshold. The corresponding eigenvalues give us the actual value amount of these increases. jpg Now we rename the summed matrix and put it to be M https miro. jpg We have to maximize this function E u v for corner detection. com max 504 0 FIdvkHWmkOZCpVGX. jpg By solving for the eigenvectors of M we can obtain the directions for both the largest and smallest increases in SSD. When R \u03bb2 or vice versa the region is an edge. jpg In the above figure if we take flat region no gradient changes observed in any direction similary along the edge direction So both flat region edge region are bad per patch matching While in corner region move window in all direction observe significant changes in gradient Corner detection The idea is to consider a small window around each pixel P in image We want to identify all such pixel windows that are unique.
