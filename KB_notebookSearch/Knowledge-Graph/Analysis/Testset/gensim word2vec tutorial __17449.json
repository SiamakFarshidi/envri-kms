Another issue I had with these tutorials was the data preparation step too often the authors chose to load an existing preprocessed dataset use a toy example or skip this part. Training the model Gensim Word2Vec Implementation We use Gensim implementation of word2vec https radimrehurek. Word2Vec Tutorial The Skip Gram Model. Word2Vec In this first step I set up the parameters of the model one by one. No we get what other characters as Homer does not often refers to himself at the 3rd person said along with homer such as how he feels or looks depressed where he is hammock or with whom marge. Displaying both allows for a more accurate and an easier management of their influence. During my experimentations I noticed that lemmatizing the sentences or looking for phrases bigrams in them had a big impact over the results and performance of my models. W467ScBjM2x Original articles from Mikolov et al. com the support network for instant peer support a few months ago I began looking into Language Models and Word2Vec particularly. See you around Also please check Supportiv http www. To set it alpha min_alpha epochs 0. Let s see what the bigram homer_simpson gives us by comparison What about Marge now Let s check Bart now Looks like it is making sense Willie the groundskeeper for the last one Similarities Here we will see how similar are two words to each other Who could forget Moe s tavern Not Barney. com around Simpson ized logo Materials for more in depths understanding Word Embeddings introduction https www. For instance dog puppy and pup are often used in similar situations with similar surrounding words like good fluffy or cute and according to Word2Vec they will therefore share a similar vector representation. htmlThe main reason we do this is to catch words like mr_burns or bart_simpson As Phrases takes a list of list of words as input Creates the relevant phrases from the list of sentences The goal of Phraser is to cut down memory consumption of Phrases by discarding model state not strictly needed for the bigram detection task Transform the corpus based on the bigrams detected Most Frequent Words Mainly a sanity check of the effectiveness of the lemmatization removal of stopwords and addition of bigrams. 10 Most similar words vs. 8 Random words Let s compare where the vector representation of Homer his 10 most similar words from the model as well as 8 random ones lies in a 2D graph Interestingly the 10 most similar words to Homer ends up around him so does Apu and sideshow Bob two recurrent characters. 4546 Acknowledgements Pouria Mojabi https www. Final ThoughtsI hope you found this tutorial useful and had as much fun reading it as I had writing it. For that we are going to use t SNE implementation from scikit learn. I am simply going to give a very brief explanation and provide you with links to good in depth tutorials. 00 negative int If 0 negative sampling will be used the int for negative specifies how many noise words should be drown.

Final Thoughts Final Thoughts 7. I am not the only one annoyed by some of these issues https groups. Burns became mr_burn after the preprocessing As we can see and that is very nice all the 20 words are forming one cluster around Mr. What troubled me the most in these online tutorials was their mismanagement of the model training the code worked and I got results which appeared to be decent at first but the more I looked into them the more disturbing they were. com gensim models phrases. com gensim word2vec tutorial starter code. 0 https radimrehurek. com ambarish fun in text mining with simpsons data 25MB PreprocessingWe keep only two columns raw_character_text the character who speaks can be useful when monitoring the preprocessing steps spoken_words the raw text from the line of dialogueWe do not keep normalized_text because we want to do our own preprocessing. However I always thought that one of the most important parts of the creation of a Word2Vec model was then missing.

Along with the papers the researchers published their implementation in C. The loggings here are mainly useful for monitoring making sure that no threads are executed instantaneously. I noticed that these two parameters and in particular sample have a great influence over the performance of a model. 3 Libraries used xlrd 1. To make the visualizations more relevant we will look at the relationships between a query word in red its most similar words in the model in blue and other words from the vocabulary in green. html The data I chose to play with the script from the Simpsons both because I love the Simpsons and because with more than 150k lines of dialogues the dataset was substantial This dataset contains the characters locations episode details and script lines for approximately 600 Simpsons episodes dating back to 1989. After weeks of hard labor I finally managed to get decent results but I was frustrated by these online tutorials which were for the most part misleading. 05 min_alpha float Learning rate will linearly drop to min_alpha as training progresses. Brief explanation Word2Vec was introduced in two papers Material for more in depths understanding between September and October 2013 by a team of researchers at Google. com pierremegret dialogue lines of the simpsonsThe missing values comes from the part of the script where something happens but with no dialogue. 3781 and https arxiv. 0 1e 5 alpha float The initial learning rate 0. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PLAYGROUND AFTERNOON Removing the missing values Cleaning We are lemmatizing and removing the stopwords and non alphabetic characters for each line of dialogue. Getting Started Setting up the environment python 3. Maggie is indeed the most renown baby in the Simpsons Bart and Nelson though friends are not that close makes sense Odd One Out Here we ask our model to give us the word that does not belong to the list Between Jimbo Milhouse and Kearney who is the one who is not a bully Milhouse of course What if we compared the friendship between Nelson Bart and Milhouse Seems like Nelson is the odd one here Last but not least how is the relationship between Homer and his two sister in laws Damn they really do not like you Homer Analogy difference Which word is to woman as homer is to marge man comes at the first position that looks about right Which word is to woman as bart is to man Lisa is Bart s sister her male counterpart t SNE visualizations t SNE is a non linear dimensionality reduction algorithm that attempts to represent high dimensional data and the underlying relationships between vectors in a lower dimensional space. 1 http scikit learn.

Confused and often disappointed by the results I got I went deeper and deeper from stackoverflow threads to Gensim s Google Groups onto the documentation of the library to try and understand what went wrong in my approach. Acknowledgements Acknowledgements 9. From this assumption Word2Vec can be used to find out the relations between words in a dataset compute the similarity between them or use the vector representation of those words as input for other applications such as text classification or clustering. If set to 0 no negative sampling is used. With the loggings I can follow the progress and even more important the effect of min_count and sample on the word corpus.
