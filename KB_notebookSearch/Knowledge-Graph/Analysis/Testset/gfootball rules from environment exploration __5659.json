I would like to call rule based agent as GFootball coach simulator. When PalyerRole is involved there will be errors somehow which is blocking to locate enemy goalkeeper accurately. The sprint speed is around 0. My assumption here is that the latest PR merged in the helper is not available in the scoring environment. Run towards the goal otherwise. Also we can explore how the speed stored in ball_direction work. 00038968087756074965 0. 00039332741289399564 0. 0 while goalkeeper can catch the ball at around 0. 00017117084644269198 Right team player 1 position change at step 35 is 0. 09650498256087303 Ball position at step 9 is 0. when the ball is generally on the ground not flying Run towards the ball s left position. 0003913240507245064 0.

And below we are going to explore what is the speed during sprint. It is simulating your direction button holding action when you use controller to paly the game. Will try to use it later. Get team size Does the player we control have the ball Kickoff strategy short pass to teammate Goalkick strategy high pass to front Freekick strategy make shot when close to goal high pass when in back field and short pass in mid field Corner strategy high pass to goal area Throwin strategy short pass into field Penalty strategy make a shot Defending strategy Make sure player is running. What is better now your roommate can achieve some operations human being cannot achieve Do go through the detailed description of the GFootball observations is available here https github. 108614176511765e 05 3. So I specifically checked the palyer log during those steps. 003420717315748334 0.

What I want to explore is the gravity constant in this game. Per the video of the game I saw right team player 1 was sprinting with the ball during steps 30 to 40. Shot if we are close to the goal based on x coordinate. Take a look at left team log for beginning steps.

Make sure that the Branch in git clone and in wget call matches Global param As we always sprint Ignore drag to estimate the landing point Check whether pressing on direction buttons and take action if so Else press on direction first Find right team positions Fix goalkeeper index here as PlayerRole has issues Default PlayerRole 0 7 9 2 1 1 3 5 5 5 6 We always control left team observations and actions are mirrored appropriately by the environment.

There are couple high level tricks which can be summarized from playing the game as well 1. It seems the ball will stay at center for couple steps before the game start. GFootball environment. InstallationThe first step is to install required tools as well GFootball Rule based Bot Template and Environment ExplorationBelow we present a simple Bot with couple rules playing GFootball. 098 and drag plays a role during ball flying. When close to the ball try to take over. 01554815098643303 Ball position at step 73 is 0. In this one I m trying to use the log file to further understand the environment and try my best to summarize some rules based on my game experience. 013931572437286377 0. Keep making shot when around landing point Set up the Environment. Instead it is simulating how you shout to your roommate Why you idiot do not press RL A X when you blublublu when your roommate is playing and you are watching. com google research football blob master gfootball doc observation. 14346031844615936 Player position at step 73 is 0. 1332190954126418e 05 We can see that the sprint speed is around 0. So I keep only ball position and speed log only. 028232717886567116 Right team player 1 speed at step 35 is 0. 025729181244969368 0. 09735190495848656 We can easily see the air fraction can be ignored generally and the gravity constant in the game is around 0. 6465353332459927e 06 0. It is not simulating how you coaching a football team. 39738738536834717 Ball speed at step 9 is 0. A further look into one step. 0037410855293273926 Ball speed change between step 9 and 10 is 9.
