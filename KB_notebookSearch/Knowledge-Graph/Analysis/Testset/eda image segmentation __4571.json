Take away Most train images only have 1 or two target labels. Imagine you would already know them then we could describe the probability density our data as follows P X sum_ Z P X Z theta theta sum_ Z P Z theta cdot P X Z theta Take away This looks great You can see that several clusters only hold one specific target protein For each target protein you can see the percentage of its occurences that are placed into specific clusters. Each component tries to explain one target group we are seeking for. Reference https www. Each file represents a different filter on the subcellular protein patterns represented by the sample ID. Only a few percents are hold by cluster 5 14 22 and 27. Image SegmentationBernoulli MixtureBernoulli Mixture Bernoulli mixture models to solve different types of problems in pattern recognition like feature selection classification dimensionality reduction and rule generation. EDATake away We can see that most common protein structures belong to coarse grained cellular components like the plasma membrane the cytosol and the nucleus. Importing dependenciesFeature EngineeringMapping of targets in a location Each sample consists of four image files. In addition we find that the Mitotic spindle often comes together with the Microtubules. com bayespy bayespy reset seaborn style get image id get each image channel as a greyscale image second argument 0 in imread display each channel separately apply threshold on the nucleus image display threshold image morphological opening to remove noise Marker labelling Map component labels to hue val cvt to BGR for display set bg label to black apply threshold on the endoplasmic reticulum image display threshold image morphological opening to remove noise morphological closing Marker labelling Map component labels to hue val cvt to BGR for display set bg label to black apply threshold on the endoplasmic reticulum image display threshold images morphological opening to remove noise after binary thresholding morphological closing after binary thresholding morphological opening to remove noise after truncate thresholding morphological closing after truncate thresholding Marker labelling for binary thresholding Map component labels to hue val cvt to BGR for display set bg label to black Marker labelling for truncate thresholding Map component labels to hue val cvt to BGR for display set bg label to black apply adaptive threshold on endoplasmic reticulum image apply adaptive thresholding display threshold images Source https github. Welcome to the Human Protein Atlas Single Cell Classification Competition https storage. Here We re going to use Bernoulli Mixture Model to see How are specific proteins distributed over clusters in the dataset. And for each sample x_ n of our N data spots there exists a related latent or hidden variable z_ n that holds 1 for the component k that generated x_ n and 0 for all others. A specificity and distribution classification was performed to determine the number of genes elevated in these single cell types and the number of genes detected in one several or all cell types respectively. And in this process microtubules and thier ends are active and participate as well. Red for Microtubule channels. Consequently we find a positive correlation between these targets. Yellow for Endoplasmic Reticulum ER channels. com kaggle competitions kaggle 23823 logos header. One example 92 of Microtubules target proteins are located in cluster 7. Blue for Nuclei channels. This makes sense as both are participants for cellular division. More than 3 targets are sporadic Take away We can see that many targets only have very slight correlations. com bayespy bayespy E Step M Step Compute new log_likelihood. Bernoulli Mixture 4 Brief about Single Cell Type Atlas The Single Cell Type Atlas contains single cell RNA sequencing scRNAseq data from 13 different human tissues together with in house generated immunohistochemically stained tissue sections visualizing the corresponding spatial protein expression patterns. Feature Engineering 1 2. Model description These configurations can be seen as K components of the mixture model. png Quick Navigation 0. com allunia protein atlas exploration and baseline https docs. The scRNAseq analysis was based on publicly available genome wide expression data and comprises all protein coding genes in 192 individual cell type clusters corresponding to 12 different cell type groups. We don t know how many of them are actually there and we will have to estimate them during the analysis. There is one percent missing to fill up to 100 but this is caused by rounding errors and should not worry you. Green for Protein of interest. Brief about single cell type atlas 0 1.
