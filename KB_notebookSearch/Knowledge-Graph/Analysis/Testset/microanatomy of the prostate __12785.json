Study Tip 2 When viewing histological slides it is sometimes better to view slides from both animal models and human slides. Prostatic GlandsThe lining of the prostatic glands are simple columnar epithelium with a few basal cells Michigan Histology. The glands are seperated by connective tissue and the nuclei have no nucleoli Minarcik 2007. The capsule is composed of connective tissue and contains smooth muscle cells and nerves. They have a single large lipid droplet with a thin rim around the cytoplasm. Therefore slides from animal models have clearer anatomical structures than human slides.
