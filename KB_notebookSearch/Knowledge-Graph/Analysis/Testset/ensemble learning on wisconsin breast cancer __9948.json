Make sure not to execute the cell above 3. Question 4 Create a function that displays the correlation between different features. Question 13 Create a function to stack different models to create a stacking classifier. 2 Data Information In this section we will get information about the data and see some observations. Observation We can see that stacking classifier gives us pretty good accuracy scores the other models. Question 6 Create a function to normalize the data. We can use different model like LogisticRegression DecisionTreeClassifier SVC to create a voting classifier. 07 Bare Nuclei This is a term used for nuclei not surrounded by cytoplasm the rest of the cell. 1 Pre Profiling Report Observation The report shows that there are 11 features out of which 2 is categorical and 9 is numerical. Question 6 Create a function to replace in Bare Nuclei with 0 Print the unique values in Bare Nuclei after the opreation is performed. same results or error on testing data as that of training data. 09 Mitosis Cancer is essentially a disease of uncontrolled mitosis. Exploratory Data Analysis Section4 5. 08 Bland Chromatin Describes a uniform texture of the nucleus seen in benign cells. 2 again after restarting the runtime. 05 Marginal Adhesion Normal cells tend to stick together. Remember that we want generalize results i. 3 Importing Libraries 2. For evaluation purpose we will focus on accuracy score. Build stacking classifier using KNN RadomForest and Naive Bayes use LogisticRegression as meta_classifier. 3 Importing Libraries Section13 2. 2 Upgrading Libraries After upgrading the libraries you need to restart the runtime to make the libraries in sync. 50 of the cancer cell have Bland Chromatin less than equal to 3. Model Development Evaluation In this section we will develope different ensemble methods. You can also add proportions onto your plot. Conclusion Section7 1. Use transpose method to make the data frame more readable. corr function to find the correlation between the features in the data. Similarly we can understand the statistical inference for other features. 10 Class Benign non cancerous or malignant cancerous lump in a breast. Observations 25 of the cancer cell have Clump Thickness less than equal to 2. We can also try experimenting with various hyperparameter to improve model accuracy. Question 1 Create a function that drops the redundant rows and displays the frequency of final rows. Observation We can see that Mitosis column is negatively correlated with clump Thickness and Bland Chromatin columns. You have to use the hyperparameters setting of the model as following n_neghbors 70 and random_state 42 Question 10 Create a function to create an ensemble model using Voting Classifier. Conclusion We analyzed and understood different factors to classify if the tumor is benign or malignant. Installing Importing Libraries Section1 1. Use cross validation score to predict on the entire dataset with following parameters estimator clf stacked models X X y y cv 3 scoring accuracy Note that use the whole dataset. Use StackingClassifier from mlxtend to create the model. Exploratory Data Analysis Question 3 Create a function that displays the frequency of Malignant and Benign tumors in the class column You can plot the frequency distribution using seaborn countplot function. 1 Installing Libraries 1. Store the result of train and test scores in different list. 08 Normal Nucleoli In cancer cells the nucleoli become more prominent and sometimes there are more of them. Use seaborn heatmap function to plot the following. Split the data into 80 20 inside train_test_split. 25 of the cancer cell have Bland Chromatin less than equal to 2. 1 Data Description In this section we will get description and statistics about the data. You have to use the hyperparameters setting of the model as following base_estimator Logistic Regression n_neghbors 500 and random_state 42 Question 8 Create a function to instantiate RandomForest Classifier. Using the StandardScaler function transform scale the data in suitable format for the model. We approached this problem using build different ensemble methods where the voting classifer and random forest gave us the highest accuracy scores. Question 7 Create a function to instantiate Bagging classifer. Create a list with different models and use for loop to predict on train and test set. Post Data Processing Feature Selection Question 5 Prepare the data according to the model requirements. Print accuracy for different models with the model name. Post Data Processing Feature Selection Section5 6. 02 Clump Thickness Benign cells tend to be grouped in monolayers while cancerous cells are often grouped in multilayers. 1 Installing Libraries Section11 1. Model Development Evaluation Section6 7. Observation We can see that the data is quite imbalanced. We can see that all models generalize well on the test set without overfitting. Their are plethora of other ensemble techniques you can try on to build a better model with better accuracy score. Installing Importing Libraries 1. 75 of the cancer cell have Bland Chromatin less than equal to 5. There exists 0 missing values and 8 redundant data points. We will resolve this issue in our further analysis. Observation We can see that RandomForest model has the best accuracy scores among the models. Write a function data_prep to structure the data according to model requirement. 2 Upgrading Libraries Section12 1. 2 B Id Feature Description 01 Sample code number Unique code for each sample. Question 11 Create a function to predict accuracy score in both train and test dataset using different models. 1 Pre Profiling Report Section31 4. Those are typically seen in benign tumors. You have to use the hyperparameters setting of the model as following n_neghbors 100 and random_state 42 Question 9 Create a function to instantiate AdaBoost Classifier. Write a function plot_corr function to create a heatmap of size 10 7. Data Pre processing Section3 3. Data Acquisition Description This corpus has been collected from free research sources on the Internet and it can be retrieved from the attached link. Table of Contents 1. We can also see that uniformity of Cell Shape is higly correlated with uniformity of Cell Size. Use 500 logistic regression classifiers to create a bagging method. Question 2 Create a function that drops Sample code number feature from the dataset. Cancer cells tend to lose this ability. Then we will analyze the results obtained and make our observation. Make sure to set the random_state 42. Uniformity of Cell Shape is highly correlated with Uniformity of Cell Size Similarly we can explore information for rest of features from the report. You can plot the frequency distribution and proportion using seaborn countplot function. 50 of the cancer cell have Clump Thickness less than equal to 4. Observation We can see that there is 1 features with object datatype and 10 features as int datatype. So the loss of adhesion is a sign of malignancy. 04 Uniformity of Cell Shape Cancer cells tend to vary in size and shape. 75 of the cancer cell have Clump Thickness less than equal to 6. Data Pre Processing 3. 1 Data Description Section21 3. In cancer cells the chromatin tends to be more coarse. We can drop this feature because it won t provide any necessary infomation. Using pandas DataFrame method create a data frame to compare accuracy score of different models. Data Acquisition Description Section2 2. Question 12 Create a function to create a dataframe to compare the scores of different models. 03 Uniformity of Cell Size Cancer cells tend to vary in size and shape. 06 Single Epithelial Cell Size Epithelial cells that are significantly enlarged may be a malignant cell. Observations We can see that the value in the Bare nuclei is replaced with 0. Observation We can observe that their is a unique feature that uniquely identifies each data point.
