I did not dive into the variety of wavelet function that can be chosen depending on the property of your signal. First naive visualization Observations births per day The birth data shows periodic features as expected at the year scales and smaller ones Scaleogram This first scaleogram is not very impressive. This is much better we now see very well a yearly variation and also an approximately 6 month one However now the small scale weekly variations are invisible. dlanSYjQUrjzh2rRGbtqiX1m7e8ykg1nucKJEl50aT2odhsMGTUsc_TwkBH5Jlw6GKGnRiXl1qhqJh4CGzlY_B79mrmHO6V0N4h9_4_TqVTEYxbqQFlNmJJjM2 hkgIxsQtj0wXu_Vhvse772UwlTnk zxtp_5z cxFIcACGiYg. The same plot in frequency domain and details on multiresolution analysis can be found here https www. ipynb Sum of periodic varitionsYou can see bellow that even if the same three waves are present at the same time on the signal the wavelet transform can separate them nicely if their respective periods are different enough. org wiki Spectrogram but in the case of wavelet the resolution in time vary with the scale value on the Y axis. com kf 12226085 eyJhbGciOiJkaXIiLCJlbmMiOiJBMTI4Q0JDLUhTMjU2In0. org wiki Continuous_wavelet_transform CWT. Next an example time ordered dataset has been used to demonstrate stepby step how the CWT apply to standard data. The following examples are based on this module. IntroductionRecently I had to do a preliminatory analysis on birth data. It appears visually as the width of the band on the Y axis. This is an expected result for periodic non sinusoidal waves. Which lead to two cones with the same shape but more energy intensity on the Z axis that the very short step in time. com How the scale parameter relates to period and frequency https github. The code bellow just load the data and extract the daily number of birth per day in the 1969 1988 year range. Also some fuzzy vertical features appear around the second harmonic which is fainter and has an amplitude of 1 4 of the first one for a triangle wave. A feature is appealing on the weekly stripe it shows each years at the same period so let s have a closer look to distinguish if it is a real feature or an artefact from missing data Zoom on the featureOn first sight a weekly patterns appears to be very regular but something happens around christmas let zoom again on this period Now it s clear the suspect looks like an end of year effect Christmas the 23 24 25 December shows abnormally low number of births and these days depart from the weekly pattern The starter kernel https www. com alsauve scaleogram blob master doc scale to frequency. This example show you how wavelets are appropriate to detect variations localized in time. They are also well localized in time the stripe beginning an end match the pulse. Manual preliminatory analysis is available in this starter kernel https www. It is also known as the tradeoff between time and frequency. Hence a bump is similar to a periodic signal with. Have fun and plussify if you liked this See also PyWAvelets https pywavelets. Birth rate is known to have natural seasonal variations It can also be influenced by many other factors like working habits These influences are expected at different time scales The impact of all these factors can also change with timeFor all these reasons multi resolution analysis is a tool of choice for this kind of data. I expected to be able from python to do something like view data scales and get a plot with meaningful labels on the axis. 1175 1520 0477 281998 29079 3C0061 3AAPGTWA 3E2. How periodic variations displays on a scaleogram For the first example the signal generated is a cos wave with a gaussian envelop. You can also observe that the stripes width scale with the period length scale. The result is much better but now the pixels at low periods values are elongated along the Y axis. The same methodology can be extended to network traffic analysis to detect unusual behaviours. How discrete events displays on a scaleogram The next demo signals simulates discrete events as a serie of smooth spikes on the left gaussians with different values of sigma 2 sigma_1 2 2 sigma_2 10 2 sigma_3 20 a serie of steps with different value for total width w1 2 w2 20 w3 100 Discrete events produce cone shaped structures on the scaleogram that are also known as the cone of influence. If you look at the horizontal guide lines you can see that its base is related to the approximative period in time of the bumps 2s 10s 20s. com asauve births variation over the week. com fr dokumentation timefreqspectrumalgorithmscwt_fr To check frequency views of wavelet pulses on weisang. Sauve Significance tests for the wavelet power and the waveletpower spectrum https hal. This is achieved with the yscale log option. What is a scaleogram In the wavelet formalism a scaleogram is a 2D representation of 1D data with On the X axis the time On the Y axis the scale The scale correspond to the signal periodicity to which the transform is sentitive to. The upper plot will be different each time this notebook is run so try by yourself Now that the most common kind of signal variations have been detailed it is time to go for the real thing Analysis of a real dataset hail to the babies The dataset is birth data from the CDC providing the number of children born each day with consistent filling between 1969 and 1988 included. com alsauve scaleogram the visualization tool used in this notebook A Practical Guide to Wavelet Analysis https journals. In order to get an homogenous definition on the scaleogram the period values have to be evenly spaced in log space then converted to scale values as shown bellow OK now we can see signal variations at all scales. It may also be caused by holiday impact on birth rate and may need further study An end of year effect has been spotted around christmas and January the 1st. But let s look right now to a scaleogram of simple signals. Try by yourself on your favorite time space ordered dataset. The exact value for the amplitude of variations is dependent of the wavelet but will stay close to the order of the real value see the cos wave plot for hints. Smooth spikes gaussians are often closer to real data structures and build cones extending toward larger scales. Still you can change the set value at the top of this notebook to try other functions like mexh or gaus5. This is a known property of the wavelet transform when the scale increase the resolution in time decrease. Periodic variations with non sinusoidal shapeWe have seen than cos waves appear as stripes on the CWT let s try another periodic signal and see what happens A triangle wave with a 30s period With assymetry the signal is increasing 80 of the timeA large stripe very similar to the cos wave case appear this is the first harmonic. fr hal 00318404 document A statistically well founded paper by Z. io en latest A fairly complete wavelet library in python scaleogram https github. sg37wxxpESt5qPN4cj_xTw. CO 3B2 The reference paper for wavelet analysis by Christopher Torrence and Gilbert P. Very frustrating Hence as wavelets should be easyly accessible from python I wrote a simple PyPi module scaleogram dedicated to plot the continuous wavelet transform. NormalizationRemoving the mean value is mandatory otherwise the borders of the data are considered as steps which create a lot of spurious cone shaped detection. These effects are well known as the cone of influence this is why an optional mask is overplot on this area. You can observe some fuzzyness in the detection as the band width is not null this is due to the fact that wavelets does not detect a single frequency but rather a band. In other words the CWT measure the periodicity Y axis of a signal at a given location X axis the amplitude of the oscillations Z axis Ok until now Then let s test with some other signals Periodic varitions at different scales multiresolution analysisFor the next example 3 pulses with increasing periodicity are added on the data with p1 10s p2 2 p1 p3 4 p1 The pulses appear at the expected Y location matching their respective periodicity they are localized in periodicity frequency. This one may have remained unseen with other frequency based method. I recommend this fairly complete paper on the significance level https hal. The signal sampling is set at 1 sample second which means no time array is provided. How noise looks like on a scaleogram Bellow is the result of processing gaussian noise obtained with randn Noise displays usually as a patchwork of features and some bumps can look like real data features so you have to be careful when using real data to check the level of noise when appropriate. Steps are much more like abnormal values for one sample w1 and missing data for large number of samples w3. Now a second harmonic is visible at exactly half the period value of the first harmonic. html Check monthes with abnormal birth values does not show missing data for December which is consistent with the presence of some value for the affected dates The 1st and 2nd of january are also affected which is understandable as there are usually less personnal available on these dates SynthesisThe scaleogram has been Built from normalized data mean removal Log scaled to be more readable at all scalesThe CWT reveals a lot of information in a short amount of time A weekly variation showing the habits in the hospitals is present over several decades A second stripe at half a week is expected as the weekly patter is not an axact cosinus An increase in the weekly pattern is visible in the 80 s which can be either caused by a change in the work habits of the hospitals a change in birthrate or simple variation of the population A strong yearly trend is present which is a well known seasonal variation in the birthrates humans are visibly prone to it A second stripe at half a year is clearly a second harmonic Fuzzy patterns appears in the 3 to 1 month zone that could be due to a third harmonic as tha yearly variation are so strong. After removal of the mean value no scaling the scaleogram looks like Adjusting the scalesThe amplitude range of the color map Z axis is now set with the clim 0 2500 parameter. The CWT is a powerful tool that is growingly used as input for neural networks and can be usedto create new features for classification or anomaly detection. ipynb For basic conversion between scales and time frequency domain values by A. This notebook is an introduction to 1D data analysis using continuous wavelet transform https en. ConclusionsIn this notebook we have seen how the basic kind of signal variations translate ontoa scaleogram. com fr dokumentation timefreqspectrumalgorithmscwt_fr. Wavelets are specially well suited for this job. This effect is related to the bandwidth of the wavelet. When you are looking at this kind of spectrogram you are doing multiresolution analysis. Using logaritmic scaleTo be able to see the small periods and the large ones at once it is better to use logarithmic scale on the Y axis. It has been written to be easily accessible to complete beginners provide usefull error messages and packed with online help explaining what is computed under the hood. if you have some time. Compo Continuous Wavelet Transform CWT https www. fr hal 00318404 document by Z. You may also wish to read further How the scale parameter relates to period and frequency https github. While the first two steps are small enough to look like a gaussian bump the large one is different. Still an horizontal line shows up at about 7 days periodicityHigh values do appear near the bordersof the scaleogram which are a normal behaviour of the wavelet processing. As I did not used wavelets for quite some time it did not went that way and I spent quite a long time to get painfully some visualization with the Y axis labelled either in frequency or periods units. The value correspond to the amplitude of the signal variation measured These variations are located at time X and have a periodicity YThis kind of plot is a special kind of spectrogram https en. aTIWJ KWMoRHslUTFSJqfg __results__. However the steps case is more tricky. You will find here How to compute a scaleogram which is a 2D view of 1D time ordered data A guided tour of the zoo how basic data appears on this kind of spectrogram Apply the methodology to an example datasetThe python module used for the examples is scaleogram. To see the yearly features an appropriate scales range is generated with period2scales. The periodic signal appear now as an horizontal continuous stripe at location Y p1 which intensity vary with the amplitude of the periodic signal. Remember that the wavelet detects variations in time Well this is that the stepping up is considered as one variation alone at small scales as it is for the step down.
