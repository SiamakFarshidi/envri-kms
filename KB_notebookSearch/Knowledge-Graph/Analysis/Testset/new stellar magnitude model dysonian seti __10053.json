OverviewA model of stellar magnitude was presented in Dysonian SETI With Machine Learning https www. More importantly there s an issue that can be corrected here. Anomalously dim stars would cluster near a plane given by 0. Squared residual modelingWe corrected for position based bias but error also seems to depend on position in the sky. 64Y Z 0Upon further analysis we narrowed the issue down to the allwise_w1 magnitude. We re only using allwise_w2 at this point. Regression training is done over a sample of available data. com Microsoft LightGBM this time. Look for the blue dot. What we re looking for here is that there a no beams of candidates aligned with Earth which would indicate there are possible line of sight artifacts. Some systematics artifacts are removed from the data. Next we define a function that extracts the features used to train regression models. KIC 8462852 Where s the Flux _ arXiv 1509. Magnitudes allwise_w3 and allwise_w4 also seem to have their own systematics based on cross database analysis. It s fast and accurate. The following function gets the within group differences. The model_response column will contain the response of the blend plus the response of the residual model we just trained. We ll just remove all of the rows that are potentially problematic. com solorzano multi stellar seti candidate selection part 1 Multi Stellar SETI Candidate Selection Part 2 https www. We could presumably lose some information by including position but it greatly improves model performance. com solorzano 257k gaia dr2 stars from the Northern and Southern hemispheres with photometry from a number of other databases. A random forest works well for this because of the nature of the feature space. Positive anomaly values indicate a star is dimmer than expected. It should be noted that excluding position features from the base model and applying a correction on the residuals wouldn t work this well. 3 PPMXL 2MASS AllWISE and Tycho2. extra info columns individual models the blend position based residual correction removal of giants add the residual column regional residual variance anomaly metric Discard big array. It seems reasonable to do that even though it s not clear that it helps a whole lot. Some changes and improvements are introduced in this kernel We re using a dataset of 257K Gaia DR2 stars https www. 2015 that happens to be in the dataset. It seems to help slightly. We ve found these additional differences improve model performance. In addition to distance we re including distance in the galactic plane and a couple gaussian transformations of the distance from the galactic plane which seem to help the model resolve variations in extinction due to proximity to galactic latitude 0. com solorzano multi stellar seti candidate selection part 3 Updates 9 1 2018 Removed region with apparent Gaia magnitude artifacts. We will use it in residual and squared error modeling. It s a sensitive model. Note that in addition to calling populate_mag_columns we ve added some differences between Gaia magnitudes and specific magnitudes from other databases. This means there s likely a complex interaction between position and spectrophotometric features. Adjustment for position based distortionsThe base model already included position features as they greatly improve model performance. A sample of ordinary stars is shown in gray. Giants are removed post training and RMSE is subsequently 0. Anomalously dim stars are shown in green. DataData was obtained from the Gaia Archive https gea. Follow ups Multi Stellar SETI Candidate Selection Part 1 https www. A star s position in the sky is also a feature. It has a standard deviation of 1. We do want the model to learn about the spectrophotometric characteristics of giant stars but we ll remove them from further consideration at this stage of the analysis. mean squared error of magnitude residuals. com solorzano 257k gaia dr2 stars. Those kinds of artifacts seem to be largely removed. com solorzano dysonian seti with machine learning. It actually is consistent with what we see in the work_data frame now By concatenating work_data and test_data we end up with results for the whole dataset minus giants. It also has a optional trim_fraction parameter that allows outliers of training subsets to be removed. The anomalously bright star control group is shown in red below. _SETI with Gaia The observational signatures of nearly complete Dyson spheres_. We ll include our sun in visualizations. Train Test splitWe ll use 90 of the data work_data for cross validation and hype parameter optimization. It s usually possible to squeeze a bit more performance by modeling residuals. A position based magnitude bias correction is applied to the residuals of the blend. These results are not that bad if you consider we re modeling noise. Some outliers and a sample of ordinary stars are shown in 3D scatter charts. Look for the black dot. com solorzano multi stellar seti candidate selection part 2 Multi Stellar SETI Candidate Selection Part 3 https www. The standard deviation of anomaly should be 1. AcknowledgmentsThis work has made use of data from the European Space Agency ESA mission Gaia https www. int web gaia dpac consortium. hist can be very slow. Helper functions used in modelingSome boilerplate The following function is similar to the one we used to train the original model except this one averages out multiple runs of k fold cross validation. Its model results follow. com solorzano removal of gaia dr2 stars with apparent systematic. Giant removalIn prior kernels we found that the model struggles with giant stars. KIC 8462852KIC 8462852 is an enigmatic star Boyajian et al. int archive using its ADQL query tool and made available in a Kaggle dataset https www. A concrete example is Gaia DR2 1596779097312755328 an extremely bright outlier. The anomaly metric is the key result. So we ll take advantage of the trim_fraction parameter of the cross validation modeling transform to ignore outliers when training this position based correction. Because the model includes position features a extreme outlier can affect its neighbors. Model featuresPrimarily we want to use differences between magnitude observations made with different photometric filters. We re basically using a random forest to estimate the regional variance i. _Dysonian Approach to SETI A Fruitful Middle Ground _ Journal of the British Interplanetary Society vol. int gaia processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium DPAC https www. We re also adding KIC 8462852 to the 3D scatter charts. We ll also get some bright and ordinary controls. Its standard deviation is roughly 1. BlendThe blend only has two models this time. Hyperparameters for gaussian transformations of distance from plane. It s unusual to find that a neural network does better than a GBM with a relatively small number of features. Note that we re including color_index as a feature here in case there are color based dependencies to the distortions. 156 165Zackrisson et al. Note that once again we re using the trim_fraction parameter so that extreme outliers don t distort neighbor results. Anomaly metricThe anomaly metric is defined as the locally standardized model residual. Final transformation and validationThe test data we set aside has the following approximate RMSE This is lower than we saw previously but that s because we removed giants. Additionally AllWISE magnitudes other than allwise_w2 are no longer used because of line of sight artifacts. Space distribution of star groupsThe following function calculates rectangular x y z coordinates for each star. Anomalous and control group selectionFor visualization purposes let s get a list of dim outliers at a 3 sigma cut off. OutputModel results and other dataset columns are made available in the output tab of this kernel. The concept is similar to that of a trimmed average. The regression label will be defined by the following variable. The anomaly column is the key result. ReferencesBoyajian et al. Multiple runs of k fold cross validation are averaged out. Extra columnsWe ll add some columns for convenience and informational purposes. The remaining 10 test_data will be set aside for final confirmation and validation. We ve found it s better to separate them into groups first. 08351 Get rid of big frame Due to Pandas versioning issue plt. In addition to Gaia DR2 parallax and photometry the dataset includes magnitude observations from GSC 2. 0 absent extreme outliers. Columns found in the data frame are Removal of duplicates and region with artifactThere are rows with duplicate source_id values multiple Tycho2 matches and some apparent line of sight artifacts as explained in Removal of Gaia DR2 Stars With Apparent Systematic https www. X points to the galactic center and Z is perpendicular to the galactic plane. LightGBM modelWe re usng LightGBM https github. Its neighbors will be unusually dim according to the model. Funding for the DPAC has been provided by national institutions in particular the institutions participating in the Gaia Multilateral Agreement. Note about AllWISE artifactIn an earlier version of the kernel we had removed the region around an apparent line of sight artifact. Since giants have been removed these brighter than expected stars are largely in the main sequence. It s an ordinary star according to the model. The separation function we will use to remove giants is visually derived. At most we use these many records in each pass Neural NetworkThis is a little surprising. Note that in addition to position features we re including a parallax_error derived feature. Model results are made available in the output tab.
