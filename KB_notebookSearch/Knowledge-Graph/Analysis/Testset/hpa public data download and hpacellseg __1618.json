As I mentioned in Single Cell Patterns https www. They are much smaller in size you will loose some info compared to tif file but maybe that s enough for your model. To download jpeg simply change. Each channel is approximately 8MB. Downloading HPA public data Update 2021 02 26 I indicated which images are in trainset in the column in_trainset. com CellProfiling HPA Cell SegmentationBelow is a demonstration of installing and using this segmentation tool on some of the downloaded images above. com lnhtrang single cell patterns notebook we merged some classes for this competition. All label names in the public HPA and their corresponding index. We have 17 cell lines in the training set and test set. Please remove them so you don t have to download twice. org 10005 921_B9_1_blue. Warning These are raw full size images. Remove all images overlapping with Training set Remove all images with only labels that are not in this competition For nuclei For full cells post processing Visualizing the segmentation masks we just predicted above. With 82495 77668 images 4 channels everything amounts to around 2. The function to convert from label names to indexes is also added if you want to double check. For example https images. So if you want to download extra public data for training and downloading is too slow because of big size you probably want to consider Downloading just 17 cell lines 67k images 4 channels instead of 77. You have a lot of Nucleoplasm and Cytosol in the training set already so maybe you just need more rare labels Using jpeg images. I have also added a column Label_idx. These were purposely created for visualization on HPA website.
