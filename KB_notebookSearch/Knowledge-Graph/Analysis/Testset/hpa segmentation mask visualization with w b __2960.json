Thus it s instance segmentation. Feel free to use Weights and Biases overlay tool to visualize more images. get cell mask resize mask and image log the image as well as the mask log green channel Close W B run. Thus each image has multiple numbers of cells. Install HPA Cell Segmentation tool. ai library log images and overlays Image ID Initialize W B Get red blue and yellow channel images. For full cells all the three reference except green channels are required. To silent W B logs HPA Segmentation tool related imports utility function that returns W B Image. ai site overlay visualization tool to interactively visualize all the segmentation mask generated using the provided HPASegmentation tool. Imports and Setups W B Setup Install wandb. gov genetics glossary Organelle. The image level labels point to the presence of that protein in the cells in general. There are a total of 21 806 training images. Here s the W B report summarizing the results http bit. com c human protein atlas image classification 28 organelles were used as labels and the task was to predict image level labels given input image predict the organelles. Interesting This calls for cell segmentation. Learn more about overlay logging here https docs. But what are we predicting There s a specific _protein of interest_ signal in the green channel that can be present in an organelle or multiple organelles in each cell. csv Path to images We will not be needing the green channel to get the segmentation mask as shown in this kernel https www. Stack the channels to form image. gif In this competition we are provided with image level labels and the task is to classify each cell in a given image into one or multiple labels. That s what makes it a more challenging problem statement. We will visualize a small fraction of the images. Initialize Segmentation Model Log Segmentation MasksAfter the above cell is executed head over to the W B project to visualize the segmentation masks and other visualizations. ai ayush thakur hpa segmentation mask https i. The authors have provided with HPA Cell Segmentation https github. Is it good In a discussion thread I read that it can accurately segment cells in 90 of test set images. But we also need to differentiate one cell from another cell. That s an excellent baseline to start with and focus on cell level classification. Here s the link to my W B project https wandb. In this competition the task is to predict cell level labels using signals from image level labels. Thus at the cell level the protein might not be present in the ground truth organelle. png Install Weights and Biases. We have to know the presence of the cells in an image. In this notebook I will be using Weights and Biases https wandb. Hyper parameters Prepare Dataset Get train. Each cell consists of multiple organelles https www. Get the label For nuclei segmentation only blue channel is required. You can get your auth key here https wandb. In the previous HPA competition https www. Create an account on https wandb. Note Since we have silenced the W B logs head over to your W B profile page and open hpa segmentation mask project. ly play with segmentation masks https i.
