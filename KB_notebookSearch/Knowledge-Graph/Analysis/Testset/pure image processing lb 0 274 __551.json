It reads the images convert them into binary after some preprocessing steps Then it simply labels connected components and considers each obtained component as a nuclei. Writing submission file Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output. green channel happends to produce slightly better results than the grayscale image and other channels morphological opening size tuned on training data Otsu thresholding Invert the image in case the objects of interest are in the dark side second morphological opening on binary image this time connected components. com keegil keras u net starter lb 0 277 but slghtly adapted to our case. Reading data List of operations to be performed on each image Computing output for each image RLE encoding Taken from this kernel https www. However some parameters have been tuned on the training data.
