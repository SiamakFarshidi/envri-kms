The attention output for each head is then concatenated using tf. org api_docs python tf distribute in general certain objects will have to be created inside the strategy s scope Here is the rule of thumb Anything that creates variables that will be used in a distributed way must be created inside strategy. nbsp NOTE The parsed images are tf. transpose and tf. Multi head attention consists of four parts Linear layers and split into heads. Unlike the technique described in the paper which prepends a learnable embedding to the sequence of encoded patches to serve as the image representation all the outputs of the final Transformer block are reshaped with tf. function def replica_fn batch tensor0. 3 TRANSFORMER SCALED DOT PRODUCT ATTENTION Scaled dot product attention is an attention mechanism where the dot products are scaled down by sqrt d_k. shape batch_size input_seq_len d_model Residual connection followed by layer normalization batch_size target_seq_len d_model Merging connection between encoder and decoder MHA batch_size target_seq_len d_model Residual connection followed by layer normalization batch_size target_seq_len d_model batch_size target_seq_len d_model Residual connection followed by layer normalization batch_size target_seq_len d_model batch_size target_seq_len d_model adding embedding and position encoding. The attention function used by the transformer takes three inputs Q query K key V value The equation used to calculate the attention weights is Large Attention Q K V softmax_k frac QK T sqrt d_k V The dot product attention is scaled by a factor of square root of the depth. Each replica is essentially a copy of the training graph that is run on each core and trains a mini batch containing 1 8th of the overall batch size Google Cloud Dataset path to training and validation images Local path to training and validation images Set Mixed Precision Global Policy To use mixed precision in Keras you need to create a tf. This is done because for large values of depth the dot product grows large in magnitude pushing the softmax function where it has small gradients resulting in a very hard softmax. softmax is normalized on the last axis seq_len_k so that the scores add up to 1. Policy typically referred to as a dtype policy. The tensors are then interpolated by these probabilities then concatenated back to a single tensor. This should give you enough information to define the feature description. What is most impressive about these methods is a single end to end model can be defined to predict a caption given a photo instead of requiring sophisticated data preparation or a pipeline of specifically designed models. For example consider that Q and K have a mean of 0 and variance of 1.

The output of each sublayer is LayerNorm x Sublayer x. This can be found on the GCP project dashboard page. This will vastly reduce the running time and limit the time TPUs will sit idle waiting for data from the local VM. 1 TRANSFORMER POSITIAL ENCODING Since this model doesn t contain any recurrence or convolution positional encoding is added to give the model some information about the relative position of the words in the sentence. nbsp WARNING XLA can not currently compile functions where dimensions are not inferrable that is if it s not possible to infer the dimensions of all tensors without running the entire computation nbsp NOTE XLA compilation is only applied to code that is compiled into a graph in TF2 that s only a code inside tf. 5 BASIC DATA DEFINITIONS INITIALIZATIONS 2. Therefore it is impossible in general to obtain the averaged per example loss over the whole distributed batch from by simply dividing it by the number of replicas. Plot the image embedding patches Layer Arguments Layers Layer Norm 1 Create a multi head attention layer. In this notebook we use a fixed number of training steps so we can also use python tf. Hence square root of dk is used for scaling and not any other number because the matmul of Q and K should have a mean of 0 and variance of 1 and you get a gentler softmax. 3 INITIALIZE LOGGER INFORMATION6.

We also have to discuss how to collect the returned values from strategy. seq_len_q seq_len_k shape. However variables and a few computations should still be in float32 for numeric reasons so that the model trains to the same quality. 3 Build the ViT Model The ViT model consists of multiple Transformer blocks which use the layers. function Kaggle Discussion TPU Extreme Optimizations Kaggle Notebook Custom Training Loop With 100 Flowers on TPU6 nbsp nbsp MODEL TRAINING nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp 10514 In this section we will define the training and validation routines as well as the final custom training loop that will execute everything we have worked on up until this point. nbsp DEFINITION The term numeric stability refers to how a model s quality is affected by the use of a lower precision dtype instead of a higher precision dtype. Datasets we will use for training and validation4. However there are two lower precision dtypes float16 and bfloat16 each which take 16 bits of memory instead. org api_docs python tf data Dataset API we can use strategy. 02368 In gradient accumulation each replica receives several batches before the optimizer applies the graidents we divide the sum of per examples losses by the update size i.

Let s go over two important points1. 4 WRAP THE CONFIGURATION DETAILS IN A CLASS OBJECT FOR EASY ACCESS 5. join TOKEN_LIST x. the number of examples used for one parameter update rather than by the size of a single distributed batch. There are N decoder layers in the transformer As Q receives the output from decoder s first attention block and K receives the encoder output the attention weights represent the importance given to the decoder s input based on the encoder s output. AUTOTUNE to automatically determine parallelization argument valuesThe parallel processing and prefetching are particular important when working with TPU This is because a TPU can process batches very quickly The dataset pipeline should be able to provide data for TPU efficiently otherwise the TPU will be idle. map _parse_function In the following cell we apply the above recipe to our BMS tfrecord dataset.

Finally the result tensor with the last dimension as value_dim can take an linear projection and return. This ensures that the words you want to focus on are kept as is and the irrelevant words are flushed out. Multi Head Attention with padding mask V value and K key receive the encoder output as inputs. On Kaggle this is always the case. This newly created raw dataset contains tf. The output of this summation is the input to the decoder layers. if epoch 2 1 or epoch EPOCHS save weights My thing crashed so I loaded the weights from the last stable epoch to continue transformer. XLA provides us with an alternative mode of running models it compiles the TensorFlow graph into a sequence of computation kernels generated specifically for the given model. Plot the image embedding patches 4. There is however a particularity about the loss function which we will discuss further down as well. function calls All the possible tokens in our InChI language The start end pad tokens will be removed from the string when computing the Levenshtein distance We want them as tf. 8 TRANSFORMER DECODER LAYER COMPONENT Each transformer decoder layer consists of sublayers 1. 7 DISTRIBUTE THE DATASETS ACROSS REPLICASWith an input pipeline written using the tf. 8 DISTRIBUTED COMPUTATION OPTIMIZING LOOPSFor each distributed batch which contains PerReplica objects as discussed previously produced by a distributed dataset we use strategy. Modern accelerators can run operations faster in the 16 bit dtypes as they have specialized hardware to run 16 bit computations and 16 bit dtypes can be read from memory faster. If query key value are the same then this is self attention. Instiate an optimizer Instantiate the encoder model Instantiate the decoder model Show the model architectures and plot the learning rate print n n. Therefore we can see that for each replica we calculate the sum of per examples losses divided by the batch size of the whole distributed batch which will give the optimizer the correct gradients to apply. lr def step self step self. data Build TensorFlow Input Pipelines Guide Better Performance With the tf. Q query receives the output from the masked multi head attention sublayer. decode_png The InChI strings and Image IDs will just be left as byte string tensors. The intuition behind this is as follows The gradients calculated on each replica will be synced across the replicas Therefore they are summed before the optimizer applies the gradients to update the model s parameters If we use the averaged per examples loss to compute the graident on each replica the final graident applied by the optimizer will correspond to the sum of these averaged per examples losses for respective replicas. for dist_batch in dist_ds strategy. 2 INDIVIDUAL VAL STEP INFORMATION6. 4 CUSTOM TRAIN LOOP INFORMATION6. shape batch_size num_heads seq_len_q seq_len_k batch_size seq_len_q num_heads depth batch_size seq_len_q d_model batch_size seq_len_q d_model CUSTOM batch_size encoder_sequence d_model TF NATIVE INNER LAYER batch_size seq_len dff OUTPUT batch_size seq_len d_model returns batch_size input_seq_len d_model Potentially unncessary by passing dropout1 to tf.

The decoder attends on the encoder s output and its own input self attention to predict the next word token. Their matrix multiplication will have a mean of 0 and variance of dk. nbsp REFERENCE Tutorial TFRecord and tf. encoder_epoch_safety_save. The following steps will be covered Use tf. compute_average_loss per_example_loss global_batch_size OVERALL_BATCH_SIZE Declare the metrics Loss train only and sparse categorical accuracy will be used Declare the learning rate schedule try this as actual lr schedule and list. 1 INDIVIDUAL TRAIN STEP INFORMATION6. Similarly to predict the fourth token only the first second and the third tokens will be used and so on. 5 TRANSFORMER POINT WISE FEED FORWARD NEURAL NETWORK Point wise feed forward network consists of two fully connected layers with a ReLU activation in between. constant s so they will operate properly within the tf. In the following cell we will demonstrate using dummy values and pretending we are distributing them how to deal with the accumulation of the loss values across replicas. prefetch to allow later batches to be prepared while the current batch is being processed. The optimizer should apply the gradient obtained from the averaged per examples loss over the whole distributed batch It s worth noting that each replica may infact receive different number of examples. The input to the encoder is the output of our image encoder i. The look ahead mask is used to mask the future tokens in a sequence. org api_docs python tf distribute Strategy run has to be called inside tf. lr lr_schedule 0 self. experimental_distribute_dataset ds dist_ds will now be distributed across all replicas. This includes but is not limited to model creation optimizer metrics sometimes checkpoint restore any custom code that creates distributed variables Once a variable is created inside a strategy s scope it captures the strategy s information and you can use it outside the strategy s scope. DistributedValues https www. Final linear layer. string feature2 tf. 7 TRANSFORMER ENCODER Each transformer encoder layer consists of sublayers 1. GlobalAveragePooling1D layer could also be used instead to aggregate the outputs of the Transformer block especially when the number of patches and the projection dimensions are large. tensorN strategy. experimental_distribute_dataset https www. 3 CREATE A LEARNING RATE SCHEDULER We utiliize the learning rate scheduler from the Attention Is All You Need paper with some minor tweaks. We will determine the number of steps or updates later for 1 training epoch. See the notebook on positional encoding https www. Knowing this we are limited to using a reduction value of SUM or NONE as the default value and some of the other options will not work with TPU. something that is a tf.

Let s get started nbsp REFERENCE Tutorial Using Iterators Tutorial Iterating Inside a tf. See the demonstration above in the scaled dot product attention section. Residual connections help in avoiding the vanishing gradient problem in deep networks. batch_size input_seq_len d_model batch_size input_seq_len d_model batch_size input_seq_len d_model adding embedding and position encoding. For example python ds. Plot the patches in the same shape order as the original image 3. org tutorials text transformer positional_encoding to learn more about it. When iterating over the dataset we will still get a tuple containing two values. Dtype policies specify the dtypes layers will run in target data type bfloat16 when using TPU to improve throughput The policy specifies two important aspects of a layer 1. InvalidArgumentError exception is thrown nbsp REFERENCE XLA Optimizing Compiler for Machine Learning2. This layer the MHA layer first projects query key and value. Otherwise you can use like pythonexample tf. 6 INITIAL DATAFRAME INSTANTIATION 2. lr_schedule lr_schedule self. It is used to pad and mask future tokens in the input received by the decoder. either the entire function is compiled with XLA or an errors. org api_docs python tf distribute Strategy experimental_local_results to obtain a tuple of tensors from all replicas and we can use tf. 2 WHAT TO DO IF YOU DON T KNOW THE FEATURE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE DATASET If you are the author who created the TFRecord files you definitely know how to define the feature description to parse the raw dataset. Today most models use the float32 dtype which takes 32 bits of memory. fit defining something within the strategy s scope WILL NOT automatically distribute the computation. 2 UNDERSTANDING THE MODELS TRANSFORMER 5. Multi Head AAttention with padding mask 2. org api_docs python tf distribute DistributedValues that is the base class for representing distributed values. See TPU extreme optimizations https www. org api_docs python tf concat to aggregate them into a single tensor. 3 TEST PRED POST PROCESSING INFORMATION7. TFRecordDataset to read the TFRecord files. When using TPU on Kaggle you don t need to specify arguments for TPUClusterResolver 2. In addition it adds a learnable position embedding to the projected vector. 11 TRANSFORMER PUT IT ALL TOGETHER Our Transformer consists of the transformer encoder transformer decoder and a final linear layer. lr_schedule step self. 0 TRANSFORMER HYPERPARAMETERS 5. opt optimizer self. In the next cell we instantiate the learning rate function the loss object and the model s inside the scope nbsp REFERENCE TPUStrategy Scope Tutorial Custom Training With TPUs5. to peform just like witout using TPU. 6f max max lr_schedule. The formula for calculating the positional encoding is as follows Large PE_ pos 2i sin pos 10000 2i d_ model Large PE_ pos 2i 1 cos pos 10000 2i d_ model 5. EDIT In this notebook we have the option to use gradient accumulation https arxiv. FixedLenFeature tf. org api_docs python tf distribute Strategy experimental_distribute_dataset to turn it into a distributed dataset which produces per replica values which are objects of type PerReplica https github. run will execute across the replicas we can look at an example python tf. The output of the encoder is the input to the decoder. current_step epoch 1 TRAIN_STEPS Save every other epoch starting with first epoch Save after last epoch too. It requires both methods from computer vision to understand the content of the image and a language model from the field of natural language processing to turn the understanding of the image into words in the right order. Example TFRecordDataset Documentation Decoding PNGs Documentation4. The jit_compile API has must compile semantics i. The output of the decoder is the input to the final linear layer. max 1 2 yields 138. h5 Get image embedding once Teacher forcing feeding the target as the next input predictions. When a TensorFlow program is run all of the operations are executed individually by the TensorFlow executor. Even if a dataset yields tuples of tensors the above code still works but replica_fn expects a single tuple of tensors as argument. The Keras mixed precision API allows you to use a mix of either float16 or bfloat16 with float32 to get the performance benefits from float16 bfloat16 and the numeric stability benefits from float32. It is a subclass of tf. nbsp REFERENCE TF Mixed Precision Overview2. Dataset Documentation5 nbsp nbsp MODEL PREPERATION nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp 10514 In this section we prepare the models for training. ZONE us east1 b The name of the GCP project where you created the TPU to use on GCP. This is done because the mask is summed with the scaled matrix multiplication of Q and K and is applied immediately before a softmax. The Transformer blocks produce a batch_size num_patches projection_dim tensor which is processed via an classifier head with softmax to produce the final class probabilities output. function https www. Plot the original image 2. Create a description of the features. Embeddings represent a token in a d dimensional space where tokens encoded vectors with similar meaning feature representation will be closer to each other.
