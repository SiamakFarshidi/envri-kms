From the samples the column 8 is an empty column it is expected because we only have 8 channels in placed columns 0 7. Biological noise Frequency flutuations that are originated by heartbeats blinkings body temperature and mood etc. The higher the beta the higher importance placed on the precision of the predictions. Pipeline design 1. input directory For example running this by clicking run or pressing Shift Enter will list all files under the input directory Feature Extraction Modelling Evaluation You can write up to 20GB to the current directory kaggle working that gets preserved as output when you create a version using Save Run All You can also write temporary files to kaggle temp but they won t be saved outside of the current session Constants Check eye closed for con42 display pd. Tukey fences for univariate outliers John Tukey suggested an intuitive statistically proven test for outliers with the following guidelines k 1. Tukey fences for univariate outliers 3. pattern recognition approach. If Taking the longest sequence as input size we ensure the full utilization of available data but the padding of all other shorter sequences mean sparse data.

Hans Berger a German psychiatrist pioneered the EEG in humans in 1924. psd snippet Fs len snippet plt. The EEG is an electrophysiological technique for the recording of electrical activity arising from the human brain. It is great at analyzing vibration when there are a finite number of dominant frequency components. Class value encoding 3. read_csv Input data files are available in the read only. Nonparametric Tukey Fences are robust methods in detecting outliers. Signal Entropy To evaluate the randomness of the signal from each channel Reason Applying the concept of entropy to time series like electroencephalography EEG is a way to quantify in a statistical sense the amount of uncertainty or randomness in the pattern which is also roughly equivalent to the amount of information contained in the signal. predict X_test classifiers mr_seql fit_mr_seql_model X_train y_train res mr_seql classifiers mr_seql. Log Loss Binary Crossentropy where y_pred probabilities and y_true are binary class labels the measure of the ability of a classifier to distinguish between classes used as a summary of the ROC curve.

For our purpose we would look at a more lightweight feature generation package. Extract statistical features with tsfresh Test Batching and processing segmentations separately Comment Due to the explosion of features and the lack of flexibiity of adjusting the number of features with the limited computing resources specifically RAM here are some of the options to approach this 1. Conclusion Imputation is not needed but could be an option for further optimisation. Fast Fourier Transform FFT To set cut off frequency or passband filter to remove noisy signal by frequencies. 2 Context backgroundEEG The first known neurophysiologic recordings of animals were performed by Richard Caton in 1875. Evaluation Pipeline Setting 5. Documentation for the calculated features https tsfresh. Taking the shortest sequence as input size we are potentially missing a lot of valuable training data for model improvements. 3 with a std of 6. It can be seen as a preprocessing step to an estimator. Building Model Candidates 5. The data was collected from COMSATS university Islamabad. The sample size depends on the duration of collecting data 250 records second for each subject and condition duration was not same. Plan for the experiments tsfresh A python package that automates the extraction of empirically tested to be relevant features. The original correlation might be induced by background noise. The eye opened data has larger sample size than eye closed with more significant difference in max values. The advent of recording the electrical activity of human beings took another half century to occur. Implementation Plan Normalization and Standardisation Convolution Global Average Pooling Global Max Pooling Moving Average Passband Filter Using subject id 0 and class 0 as sample to inspect effects Time series standardisation and normalization Test Apply Global Average Pooling GAP for Convolution Eyes Opened condition vs Eye Closed condition For Eyes Opened and Eyes Closed conditions across all channels Comment Some signals contain a lot of spikes and constant segments. 5 IQR If Q3 is 0. Calculate correlation coefficients matrix across all EEG channels. Data Cleaning Description As part of the preprocessing the aim of data cleaning is to maximise the signal to noise S N ratio. 1 Literature Review Due to time constrait it is not in great depth. We treat the con42 data as corrupted and ignore it for now. Class distirbution check and handling Comment From the 39 subjects each with both eo and ec classes the average class differences is 4. Get statistical features 4. png attachment 3fa2f2ac 0677 42c6 8660 39bc7b31acd7. Channels correlations 4. Each Column is a channel value so there are 8 channels Use them as variables The End of file name tell us if eye is close or open Use this as class For example EO means eye open and EC means eye closed Note According to the data provider The sampling rate is 250 records per second. If an EEG signal is recorded at a sampling frequency of 100 Hz the FFT can separate the signal into features in the range of 0 100 Hz. Class distirbution check and handling 3. Facebook s Kats package for time series feature extraction Test Build Feature selection Using 1 subset as a trial run to test feature selection mechanism. Moving Average 4. A less intensive alternative is needed for the feature extraction stage. subject_id encoding The actual name of subjects even just the first name are personal identifiable information which should always be masked dropped or encoded before sharing across or processing. However the speed is concerning for this feature generation method since a lot of redundant features have to be generated first. 5k upper bound for standardisation. Passband Filter With domain heuristics 4. For every subject two set of data was made. predict X_test import pickle model_folder version 0_1_0 for model_name model in classifiers. Statistically the upper bound by Tukey s rule uses Q3 1. Some files contain mostly negative values across the channels. Reason To gain a better physical understanding of how much the frequencies contribute to the resultant signals in terms of power. Signal Entropy 4. Normalization Standardization 4.

Basically any change in the surroundings that trigger any micro reactions. Goal Detect whether a person is in deep sleep or not. Power Spectral Density PSD 4. It could be helpful as a thorough and more exhausive search. Class imbalanced condition is not significant for class imputation to be beneficial. org stable auto_examples decomposition plot_pca_iris. Given its exquisite temporal sensitivity the main utility of EEG is in the evaluation of dynamic cerebral functioning. Plot the frequency response for a few different orders. Sample signal construction x np. ones N 3 Number of sample points sample spacing plt. Baseline Setting 5. Here we conduct experiments on features extraction by statistical appraoch with tsfresh. neural network approach with autoencoder. html univariate feature selection Comment Based on PCA variance explained using 12 features could explain 95 of variance. Comment Some extremely long tailed sequences are trimmed to the Tukey s 1. Results Aggregation 6. The highest class imbalanced subject has class difference of 32. Features ExtractionIntro Feature extraction is an important step in the process of electroencephalogram EEG signal classification. To think about this decision we can think about the end cases and some options. Inspect sample 2.
