Hey I m just a simple kerneling bot not a Kaggle Competitions Grandmaster There are 40 csv files in the current version of the dataset The next hidden code cells define functions for plotting data. input camelyon16_train_normal_002. IntroductionGreetings from the Kaggle bot This is an automatically generated kernel with starter code demonstrating how to read in the data and begin exploring. Let s check 1st file. input camelyon16_train_normal_003. Exploratory AnalysisTo begin this exploratory analysis first import libraries and define functions for plotting the data using matplotlib. Now you re ready to read in the data and use the plotting functions to visualize the data. input camelyon16_train_normal_001. Happy Kaggling plotting linear algebra accessing directory structure data processing CSV file I O e. read_csv Distribution graphs histogram bar graph of column data For displaying purposes pick columns that have between 1 and 50 unique values Correlation matrix drop columns with NaN keep columns where there are more than 1 unique values Scatter and density plots keep only numerical columns Remove rows and columns that would lead to df being singular keep columns where there are more than 1 unique values reduce the number of columns for matrix inversion of kernel density plots specify None if want to read whole file specify None if want to read whole file specify None if want to read whole file. Click on the Code button in the published kernel to reveal the hidden code. Delete modify and add code as you please. csvLet s take a quick look at what the data looks like Distribution graphs histogram bar graph of sampled columns ConclusionThis concludes your starter analysis To go forward from here click the blue Fork Notebook button at the top of this kernel.
