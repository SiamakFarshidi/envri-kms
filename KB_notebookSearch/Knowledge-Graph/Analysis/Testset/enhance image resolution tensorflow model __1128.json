The model only supports images with 3 color channels. If you find yourself in such sticky situation then TensorFlow Hub is here for your rescue. pdf by Xintao Wang for more details about this model. Generic Libraries Imaging Ploting Libraries TensorFlow Libraries Download Image from internet Model URL Image Path Pre Process Image If PNG remove the alpha channel. Consider a scenario where you only have such low resolution images for training your model. Setup Utility Functions Enhance ResolutionI hope this little tutorial was helpful if it was then please do consider it to UPVOTE. Let s get started. Saves unscaled Tensor Images Plots images from image tensors Load Model Load Plot Save Original Image Enhance Resolution start timer end timer Plotting High Resolution Image. The fancy looking ESRGAN is an acronym for Enhanced Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Network. There is a pre trained model in TensorFlow Hub called ESRGAN https tfhub. This model is trained on DIV2K Dataset on bicubically downsampled images on image patches of size 128 x 128Please read the paper https arxiv. We shall now get cracking with the implementation of this model. Enhancing Image Resolution using ESRGAN TensorFlow ModelWhen working with a Image Data problem we can come across images with different resolutions especially images that have a resolution of 128 x 128 or even less.
