Aggregated masks are used for visualization of the feature importance attributes. Relaxation factor controls the amount of reuse of features between different decision blocks and updated with the values of coefficients. In the paper they call the logits z. If dim is not the last dimension we have to do a transpose so that we can still perform softmax on its last dimension. Reshape to obs dims as it is almost free and means the remanining code doesn t need to worry about the rank. sort z calculate k z because the z_check vector is always 1 1. Prevent this issue for now by setting k_z 1 if k_z 0 this is then fixed later see p_safe by returning p nan. Substacting the mean will cause z_cumsum to be close to zero. com titu1994 tf TabNet to support multi label classification Stacked TabNet Submit Fast Numpy Log Loss https www. This results in the same behavior as softmax. Visualization of the feature selection mask at decision step ni tf. Initializes decision step dependent variables. Swap logits dimension of dim and its last dimension. The mean logits can be substracted from logits to make the algorithm more numerically stable. Add entropy loss Feature selection. autograph Adds the loss automatically Visualization of the aggregated feature importances tf. image Aggregated mask tf. the instability in this algorithm comes mostly from the z_cumsum. image Mask for step str ni tf. com gogo827jz optimise blending weights 4 5x faster log loss We need its original shape for shape inference. Data Preparation Model FunctionsModified from https github. calculate p If k_z 0 or if z nan then the input is invalid Reshape back to original size Training none is just for compat with batchnorm signature call Input checks if num_decision_steps 1 features_for_coeff feature_dim output_dim print f TabNet features_for_coeff features will be used for decision steps. Make shape inference work since transpose may erase its static shape. 0 finding the index 1 of the last 1 is the same as just summing the number of 1. Decision aggregation. Determines the feature masks via linear and nonlinear transformations taking into account of aggregated feature use. expand_dims aggregated_mask_values 0 3 max_outputs 1 Aliases. However in practise the numerical instability issues are very minor and substacting the mean causes extra issues with inf and nan input. Feature transformer with two shared and two decision step dependent blocks is used below. expand_dims mask_values 0 3 max_outputs 1 This branch is needed for correct compilation by tf. Entropy is used to penalize the amount of sparsity in feature selection. Do the actual softmax on its last dimension.
