Breast Cancer Data Analysis Prediction at the end OverviewBreast cancer is cancer that forms in the cells of the breasts. I could have tried to oversample instead If you like please upvote Also check my other notebooks EDA Modelling Mice Trisomy 100 acc. Let s find out Modelling PCA Analysis Remark The classes are really hard to classify looking at the graph above. com dorianvoydie eda modelling heart attack 90 accuracy score EDA Modelling Mobile price 95. png Despite the advantage of balancing classes these techniques also have their weaknesses there is no free lunch. Breast cancer survival rates have increased and the number of deaths associated with this disease is steadily declining largely due to factors such as earlier detection a new personalized approach to treatment and a better understanding of the disease. After skin cancer breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in women in the United States. com dorianvoydie eda modelling holiday package 89 acc EDA Modelling Diabetes Detection https www. The simplest implementation of over sampling is to duplicate random records from the minority class which can cause overfitting. Training models Models overview Using RandomForest Optimization Using KNN Using XGBoost Using SVM Tuning Threshold Training Artificial Neural Network Conclusion According to the results shown above these models RF AdaBoost KNN SVM XGBoost LR ANN can t make the classification between Dead and Alive patients. Hypothesis The features have no impact on the target There isn t enough rows in the dataset need more people The dataset isn t representative of the population As we undersampled the dataset we only have 66 2 rows in the end. sample method to get random samples each class Categorical FeaturesContinuous Features A bit of data engineering. Breast cancer can occur in both men and women but it s far more common in women. It consists of removing samples from the majority class under sampling and or adding more examples from the minority class over sampling. com dorianvoydie eda modelling diabetes detection Pokemon Stats https www.

Let s implement a basic example which uses the DataFrame. What are the symptoms of breast cancer Signs and symptoms of breast cancer may include A breast lump or thickening that feels different from the surrounding tissue Change in the size shape or appearance of a breast Changes to the skin over the breast such as dimpling A newly inverted nipple Peeling scaling crusting or flaking of the pigmented area of skin surrounding the nipple areola or breast skin Redness or pitting of the skin over your breast like the skin of an orange Exploratory Data Analysis Aim Understand the data A small step forward is better than a big one backwards Begin to develop a modelling strategy Features Patient_ID unique identifier id of a patient Age age at diagnosis Years Gender Male Female Protein1 Protein2 Protein3 Protein4 expression levels undefined units Tumour_Stage I II III Histology Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma Infiltrating Lobular Carcinoma Mucinous Carcinoma ER status Positive Negative PR status Positive Negative HER2 status Positive Negative Surgery_type Lumpectomy Simple Mastectomy Modified Radical Mastectomy Other DateofSurgery Date on which surgery was performed in DD MON YY DateofLast_Visit Date of last visit in DD MON YY can be null in case the patient didn t visited again after the surgery Patient_Status Alive Dead can be null in case the patient didn t visited again after the surgery and there is no information available whether the patient is alive or dead. com dorianvoydie vaccine covid 19 indicators Classes d\u00e9s\u00e9quilibr\u00e9es Class count Divide by class Class count Divide by class Resampling calculating the probabilities finding the predicted valued calculating the probabilities Finding the predicted valued Importing the Keras libraries and packages Initialising the ANN Adding the input layer and the first hidden layer Adding the second hidden layer Adding the third hidden layer Adding the output layer Compiling the ANN. Best we can do is getting a 1 2 chance of guessing right. com dorianvoydie pokemon stats Fish Classification Using CNN 97 acc. CommentsWe can now analyze categorical features as quantitative features CommentsConsidering the correlations shown above it seems really difficult to find a difference between Dead and Alive patients. Substantial support for breast cancer awareness and research funding has helped created advances in the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer.
