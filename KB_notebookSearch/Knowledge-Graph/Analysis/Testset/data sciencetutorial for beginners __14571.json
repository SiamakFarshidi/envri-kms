This can be done with for loop. If you know basic statistics you can use python easily. Review of pandas 26 1. csv dosyalar\u0131 yaz\u0131lmal\u0131. For pandas we can achieve index and value example of what we learn above guess prints what x 2 global scope x 3 local scope What if there is no local scope there is no local scope x it uses global scope x First local scope searched then global scope searched if two of them cannot be found lastly built in scope searched. Lambda function 12 1. Customization Colors labels thickness of line title opacity grid figsize ticks of axis and linestyle DICTIONARYWhy do we need dictionary It has key and value Faster than listsWhat is key and value. However we want to set one or more column to be index Setting index type 1 is outer type 2 is inner index data1. We will visualize the data with python like matplot and seaborn libraries.

Example for f This is docstring for documentation of function f tuple sequence of immutable python objects. columns 1 Name assert data. com kanncaa1 basic statistic tutorial for beginners1. PANDAS FOUNDATION REV\u0130EW of PANDASAs you notice I do not give all idea in a same time. Adding new column Broadcasting Create new column and assign a value to entire column VISUAL EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS Plot Subplot Histogram bins number of bins range tuble min and max values of bins normed boolean normalize or not cumulative boolean compute cumulative distribution STATISTICAL EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSISI already explained it at previous parts. Lets practice some other properties like keys values update add check remove key remove all entries and remove dicrionary. Rare Visualization https www. Pivoting data 21 1. com kanncaa1 plotly tutorial for beginners1. map func seq applies a function to all the items in a list ITERATORS iterable is an object that can return an iterator iterable an object with an associated iter method example list strings and dictionaries iterator produces next value with next methodzip zip lists LIST COMPREHENS\u0130ON One of the most important topic of this kernel We use list comprehension for data analysis often. We learnt key and value at dictionary part. Concatenating data 22 1. Although we learn some basics of pandas we will go deeper in pandas. How can we learn what is built in scope nested function default arguments what if we want to change default arguments flexible arguments args flexible arguments kwargs that is dictionary If you do not understand this part turn for loop part and look at dictionary in for loop lambda function where x is name of argument where x y z are names of arguments iteration example print next iteration print remaining iteration zip example unzip returns tuple Example of list comprehension Conditionals on iterable lets return pokemon csv and make one more list comprehension example lets classify pokemons whether they have high or low speed. User defined function 8 1. Data Munging Working with messy and difficult data. read_csv as in the picture. Tidy data 20 1. Not created from us like data2 we can solve this problem with interpolate We can interpolete from first value Or we can interpolate with mean read data indexing using square brackets using column attribute and row label using loc accessor Selecting only some columns Difference between selecting columns series and dataframes series data frames Slicing and indexing series 10 and Defense are inclusive Reverse slicing From something to end Creating boolean series Combining filters Filtering column based others Plain python functions Or we can use lambda function Defining column using other columns our index name is this lets change it Overwrite index if we want to modify index we need to change all of them. Therefore lets make example to understand it. Seaborn https www. Data scientist need to have these skills 1. INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON MATPLOTLIBMatplot is a python library that help us to plot data. Python Data Science Toolbox 7 1. PYTHON DATA SCIENCE TOOLBOX USER DEFINED FUNCTIONWhat do we need to know about functions docstrings documentation for functions. The easiest and most basic plots are line scatter and histogram plots. Machine Learning 1. It is not remarkable change but it is just example We can make one of the column as index. I actually did it at the beginning of manipulating data frames with pandas section It was like this data data. Because categorical data uses less memory speed up operations like groupby. set_index also you can use data. single column series NaN not a number dataframe. Nested function 10 1. between 11 and 17 which will be 14 according to the question above. com kanncaa1 deep learning tutorial for beginners1. we will learn loc more detailed later head shows first 5 rows tail shows last 5 rows columns gives column names of features shape gives number of rows and columns in a tuble info gives data type like dataframe number of sample or row number of feature or column feature types and memory usage For example lets look frequency of pokemom types if there are nan values that also be counted As it can be seen below there are 112 water pokemon or 70 grass pokemon For example max HP is 255 or min defense is 5 ignore null entries For example compare attack of pokemons that are legendary or not Black line at top is max Blue line at top is 75 Green line is median 50 Blue line at bottom is 25 Black line at bottom is min There are no outliers Firstly I create new data from pokemons data to explain melt nore easily. However Type 2 has 414 non null object so it has 386 null object. In this case it would be 11. Changes automatically assigned to data So does it work Lets check with assert statement Assert statement return nothing because it is true In order to run all code we need to make this line comment assert 1 2 return error because it is false returns nothing because we drop nan values returns nothing because we do not have nan values assert data. count number of entries mean average of entries std standart deviation min minimum entry 25 first quantile 50 median or second quantile 75 third quantile max maximum entry INDEXING PANDAS TIME SERIES datetime object parse_dates boolean Transform date to ISO 8601 yyyy mm dd hh mm ss format RESAMPLING PANDAS TIME SERIES Resampling statistical method over different time intervals Needs string to specify frequency like M month or A year Downsampling reduce date time rows to slower frequency like from daily to weekly Upsampling increase date time rows to faster frequency like from daily to hourly Interpolate Interpolate values according to different methods like linear time or index https pandas. List comprehension 15 1. However lets look at one more time. As you can see Type 1 is converted from object to categorical And Speed s converted from int to float Lets look at does pokemon data have nan value As you can see there are 800 entries. DEFAULT and FLEXIBLE ARGUMENTS Default argument example def f a b 1 b 1 is default argument Flexible argument example def f args args can be one or more def f kwargs kwargs is a dictionary lets write some code to practice LAMBDA FUNCTIONFaster way of writing function ANONYMOUS FUNCT\u0130ONLike lambda function but it can take more than one arguments. Deep Learning with Pytorch 1. Manipulating Data Frames with Pandas 32 1. Data types 23 1. The upper quartile you find the median between the median and the largest number i. Our threshold is average speed. I only take 5 rows into new data lets melt id_vars what we do not wish to melt value_vars what we want to melt Index is name I want to make that columns are variable Finally values in columns are value Firstly lets create 2 data frame axis 0 adds dataframes in row axis 1 adds dataframes in column lets convert object str to categorical and int to float. index data lets read data frame one more time to start from beginning As you can see there is index. Cleaning Data 16 1. Introduction to Python 1 1. Visual exploratory data analysis 28 1. There is a LEGB rule that is search local scope enclosing function global and built in scopes respectively. Lets chech Type 2 As you can see there are 386 NAN value Lets drop nan values also we will use data to fill missing value so I assign it to data1 variable inplace True means we do not assign it to new variable. int data frames from dictionary Add new columns Broadcasting Broadcasting entire column Plotting all data it is confusing subplots scatter plot hist plot histogram subplot with non cumulative and cumulative As you can see date is string however we want it to be datetime object close warning In order to practice lets take head of pokemon data and add it a time list lets make date as index Now we can select according to our date index We will use data2 that we create at previous part Lets resample with month As you can see there are a lot of nan because data2 does not include all months In real life data is real. Basic Tools Like python R or SQL. com kanncaa1 interactive bokeh tutorial part 1 1. Convolutional Neural Network https www. Filtering data frames 35 1. read_csv i\u00e7erisine yukar\u0131da \u00e7\u0131kan. Like a inconsistent date and string formatting. Machine Learning You do not need to understand math behind the machine learning technique. Exploratory data analysis 18 1. Stacking and unstacking data frames 40 1. Logic control flow and filtering 5 1. first copy of our data to data3 then change index lets make index start from 100. org pandas docs stable generated pandas. Example dictionary spain madrid Key is spain. Line plot is better when x axis is time. pivot index treatment columns gender values response We will use df according to treatment take means of other features mean is aggregation reduction method there are other methods like sum std max or min we can only choose one of the feature Or we can choose multiple features as you can see gender is object However if we use groupby we can convert it categorical data. Q3 Q1 IQRWe will use describe method. com kanncaa1 deep learning tutorial for beginners STATISTICAL LEARNING https www. Default and flexible arguments 11 1. The lower quartile is the median in between the smallest number and the median i. Describing melt is confusing. You only need is understanding basics of machine learning and learning how to implement it while using python. read_csv visualization tool Input data files are available in the. Outlier are smaller than Q1 1. 5 Q3 Q1 and bigger than Q3 1. Unclean data Column name inconsistency like upper lower case letter or space between words missing data different language We will use head tail columns shape and info methods to diagnose data EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSISvalue_counts Frequency countsoutliers the value that is considerably higher or lower from rest of the data Lets say value at 75 is Q3 and value at 25 is Q1. Recurrent Neural Network https www. Anonymous function 13 1. CLEANING DATA DIAGNOSE DATA for CLEANINGWe need to diagnose and clean data before exploring. Indexing data frames 33 1. Comparison operator Boolean operators and or not Filtering pandas WHILE and FOR LOOPSWe will learn the most basic while and for loopsIn this part you learn how to import csv file plotting line scatter and histogram basic dictionary features basic pandas features like filtering that is actually something always used and main for being data scientist While and for loops 2. Missing data and testing with assert 24 1. We can make it one line code that is list comprehension. in between 1 and 11 which is 6. CONCATENATING DATAWe can concatenate two dataframe DATA TYPESThere are 5 basic data types object string boolean integer float and categorical. Visual exploratory data analysis 19 1. Also we can build dataframe from dictionaries zip method This function returns a list of tuples where the i th tuple contains the i th element from each of the argument sequences or iterables. As a summary we will learn python to be data scientist Content 1. Data Visualization Title is actually explanatory. Iterators 14 1. Scatter is better when there is correlation between two variables Histogram is better when we need to see distribution of numerical data. Indexing pandas time series 30 1. values numpy BUILDING DATA FRAMES FROM SCRATCH We can build data frames from csv as we did earlier. Basic Statistics Like mean median or standart deviation. Pandas Foundation 25 1. Statistical explatory data analysis 29 1. Diagnose data for cleaning 17 1. Loop data structures 6 1.
