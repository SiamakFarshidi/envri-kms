LIVER FIRM no yes11. The Reason we choose KNN over other Algorithm is simply because it showed way better results than liner regression and many others. ALK PHOSPHATE 33 80 120 160 200 25017. Hepatitis Mortality Rate Prediction Using Machine LearningThe objective of this project is to detect of Hepatitis as well as the prediction of life expectancy of Hepatitis patients. K NN algorithm stores all the available data and classifies a new data point based on the similarity. HISTOLOGY no yes EDA Feature Selection Importance and elimination Feature Selection Importance and elimination where considered because in many case certain age are more prone to death than other age group or certain parameters are much more important and taken into consideration than others so filtering out many features help us to get a refined way of understanding whom to care most. SGOT 13 100 200 300 400 500 18. Model Building K Nearest Neighbour K Nearest Neighbour is one of the simplest Machine Learning algorithms based on Supervised Learning technique. In this project The performance is based on the accuracy rate based on which important feature where considered for prediction and the final score of algorithm. ANTIVIRALS no yes6. Data Cleaning the Data in csv is raw so we have labelled various parameters1. AGE 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 803. LIVER BIG no yes10. PROTIME 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 9020. The Machine Learning ML algorithm K Nearest Neighbor KNN is considered as the classification and prediction tools of Hepatitis disease. This means when new data appears then it can be easily classified into a well suite category by using K NN algorithm.
