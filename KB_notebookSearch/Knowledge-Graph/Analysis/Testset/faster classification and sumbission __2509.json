If we re handleing the public file we can take only 50 images or less as our objective is only to save commit and if we recognize the data is the private data we know we must use the full data length. input hpacellsegmentatormodelweights dpn_unet_nuclei_v1. Save the model outputReferences Faster HPA Cell Segmentation https www. The Image size will depend on how you trained your model. To identify this we can use the length of the sample_sumbission. Apply cell segmentation like the one above. Tuned for segmentation hpa images exclude the green area first this part is to use green channel and extend cell label to green channel benefit is to exclude cells clear on border but without nucleus with pd. max_colwidth 1 display data_df. blend rgby images into single array Create PIL Image a bytes object dt for hpa_image to remove the small pseduo nuclei this is to remove the cell borders signal from cell mask. Iter through every cell. max_columns 5 display. Can use the function above. CellSegmentator NUC_MODEL CELL_MODEL scale_factor 0. input hpacellsegmentatormodelweights dpn_unet_cell_3ch_v1. max_rows 600 display. com c hpa single cell image classification discussion 223281 To accelerate the save commit procedure an interesting idea is to identify wether we re dealing with the public test data or the private test data as we re only interested in processing the second one for the competition submission. Segmentation and Classification with EfficientNet https www. pth segmentator cellsegmentator. option_context display. This is the strategy I ll follow 1. com linshokaku faster hpa cell segmentation Even Faster HPA Cell Segmentation https www. Crop the cell and resize to the shape of the training 224 224 3 4. In my case I used EfficientNet therefore it requires a data size of 224 224 3 NUC_MODEL. 25 device cuda padding True multi_channel_model True Cell Segmentation and Classification At first I tried separating the pipeline in different loops but that required saving the results in the RAM memmory and when I tried submmiting the notebook I kept getting this message Notebook Exceeded Allowed Compute Therefore now I execute all in different batches so that I only have to save the final PredictionString Loading the pre_trained model. csv file which is 559 for the public file and larger for the private file. com samusram even faster hpa cell segmentation notebook The i ll follow is the one dschettler8845 https www. logical_and with some revision to replace this func. com glopezzz segmentation and classification with efficientnet pip install. com dschettler8845 explained to me in this discussion Does notebook running time limit include the scoring time https www. input hpacellsegmentatorraman HPA Cell Segmentation check input mask convert input mask to expected COCO API input RLE encode mask compress and base64 encoding Get single image that blends all RGBY into RGB Introduce the images as arrays.
