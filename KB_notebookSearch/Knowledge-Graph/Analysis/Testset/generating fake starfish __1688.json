Sample of Poorly Sinthesized Images ReferenceThe original repository 2 has many bugs so I forked and modified the repository 3. com yueruchen Pedestrian Synthesis GAN 3 https github. So I used weight of 125 epoch. 2 https github. 02047 Input Image for Pedestrian Synthesis GAN PS GAN Synthesized ResultsHere I can show part of the synthesized results. Since I fed only 1200 input data I think the model are overfitted. The model can be trained if we prepare an image in which the BBox and the target are replaced by noise so I trained it using a partial dataset of the competition about 1 200 sampled clips of size 256x256. Here I used the model Pedestrian Syntheis GAN 1 which was used to generate pseudo images of pedestrians. It looks sufficient to train the model but considering they are sourced from almost identical successive frames it is doubtful that they are sufficient. Can we inprove the detection model by adding new synthesized images in GAN This is the first motivation of this approach. I doubt this model can generate the data useful for object detection. The modified repository might still contain many bugs. Sample of Synthesized ImagesI trained the model for about 150 epochs but the latest model s discriminator seems overfitting because almost perfectly discriminates fake and real. What s the Notebook for This competition has 11 898 bounding boxes and 4 919 annotated. com bilzard Pedestrian Synthesis GAN number of bounding boxes number of annotated frames. It sometimes outputs completely fake looking images when fed new image which doesn t apper in train dataset.
