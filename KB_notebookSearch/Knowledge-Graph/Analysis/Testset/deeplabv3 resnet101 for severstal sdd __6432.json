The pre training effects of these three models in the Pascal VOC dataset are shown below where Pascal VOC contains 20 categories of images http www. Many deep learning architectures like fully connected networks for image segmentation have also been proposed but Google s DeepLab model has given the best results till date. Motivation In my earlier discussion post titled DRN Dilated Residual Networks Image Classification Semantic Segmentation https www. It is found that with small output feature map obtained at the end of the network the accuracy is reduced in semantic segmentation. com review dilated convolution semantic segmentation 9d5a5bd768f52. It uses Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling and bilinear upsampling for the decoder module on top of the modified ResNet block. Why using DEEPLABV3 RESNET101 For the semantic segmentation model GluonCV Torch mainly supports pre trained FCN PSPNet and DeepLab V3. png The left one is the standard convolution. Quite a few algorithms have been designed to solve this task such as the Watershed algorithm Image thresholding K means clustering Graph partitioning methods etc. For this reason dilated convolutions are used to increase the receptive field of the higher layers compensating for the reduction in receptive field induced by removing subsampling. com proxy 1 tnDNIyPePgHvb8JIx8SbqA. Thus a larger output feature map is desired. And it is found that using dilated convolution can also help for image classification task in this paper. gif Standard Convolution l 1 Left Dilated Convolution l 2 Right The above illustrate an example of dilated convolution when l 2. We can see that the receptive field is larger compared with the standard one. In the paper mentioned below it uses d as dilation factor. DeepLab V3 is a very common open source model which has very good effect on semantic segmentation tasks. Reasons of Dilated Convolution 1. com article 5710352893 Google s Deeplabv3 uses dilated convolution lets first talk little bit about dilated convolutions Dilated Convolution equation of DilatedNet https miro. In the modified ResNet model the last ResNet block uses atrous convolutions with different dilation rates. png l 1 left l 2 Middle l 4 Right The above figure shows more examples about the receptive field. A naive approach is to simply remove subsampling striding steps in the network in order to increase the resolution of feature map. In FCN it also shows that when 32 upsampling is needed we can only get a very rough segmentation results. com ateplyuk pytorch starter u net resnet https github. DeepLab V3 uses Aligned Xception as its main feature extractor with the following modifications 1. png The following shows the effects of three semantic segmentation models in the ADE20K dataset where ADE20K is a scene resolution dataset published by MIT that contains a variety of scenarios including people backgrounds and objects. com review drn dilated residual networks image classification semantic segmentation d527e1a8fb5I highly recommend you to check this link Semantic Segmentation Introduction to the Deep Learning Technique Behind Google Pixel s Camera https www.

We can see that at the summation it is s lt p that we will skip some points during convolution. com proxy 1 mlHFvK6H_wMCyURSZNZWGQ. Extra batch normalization and ReLU activation are added after each 3 x 3 depthwise convolution3. Depth of the model is increased without changing the entry flow network structure https i0. com soulmachine siim deeplabv3 PyTorch Starter U Net ResNet https www. When d 1 it is dilated convolution. 12 tensorflow python keras backend. com tensorflow tensorflow blob r1. All max pooling operations are replaced by depthwise separable convolution with striding2. such reduction in receptive field is an unacceptable price to pay for higher resolution. com blog 2019 02 tutorial semantic segmentation google deeplab i have used some of the contents from that link definitely a great resource for understanding deeplabv3 wellPlease UPVOTE if you find this kernel Helpful IMPORTS Utility Loss Function Function for training Mask Decoder Steel Dataset paths Steel DataLoader Understanding the DeepLab Model ArchitectureDeepLab V3 uses ImageNet s pretrained Resnet 101 with atrous convolutions as its main feature extractor. float mean to average on multi gpu. png Source of informations above http www. When l 1 it is standard convolution2. The right one is the dilated convolution. DeepLab uses atrous convolution with rates 6 12 and 18. When l 1 it is dilated convolution. However this also reduces the receptive field which severely reduces the amount of context.
