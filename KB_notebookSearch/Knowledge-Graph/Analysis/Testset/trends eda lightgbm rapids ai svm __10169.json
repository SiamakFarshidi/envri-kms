The hydrogen protons do not physically move in your body when you enter an MRI scanner their axes just align along the direction of the B0 field. This spinning motion is known as precession. png How does a MRI actually work MRI allows us to see inside the human body with amazing detail by using magnets and radio waves. Because protons in the different kinds of tissues in the brain such as gray matter white matter and blood all give off different amounts of energy the result of the transformed energy is a highly detailed image of the tissue inside the brain. com soham1024 visualization using nilearn https www. In the example shown in hydrogen protons in the head will then be spinning faster than those in the chest stomach and feet. If the whole body is full of hydrogen up protons all spinning at the same precessing frequency in the B0 how do we target just the ones in the brain to investigate mental health We use the fact that the precessional frequency of the protons is dependant on the magnetic field strength. The RF pulse will then only be resonant with the protons in the brain. An MRI scan combines images to create a 3 D picture of your internal structures so it s more effective than other scans at detecting abnormalities in small structures of the brain such as the pituitary gland and brain stem. Like the Earth spinning on its axis with a north and south magnetic pole each spinning hydrogen proton is like a tiny magnet that spins around on its own axis. Some will align up parallel and some will align down anti parallel while still spinning around on their own axes. Basic modelling 3. While functional connectivity can refer to correlations across subjects runs blocks trials or individual time points resting state functional connectivity focuses on connectivity assessed across individual BOLD time points during resting conditions. However this randomness changes when we place a human body into a very strong magnetic field like an MRI scanner. Looking closer at hydrogen we see it has central nucleus containing a single proton. 3 FNC correlation 2. These are the subject level cross correlation values among 53 component timecourses estimated from group inform guided ICA of resting state functional MRI. As given in the competition data summary The second set are static functional network connectivity FNC matrices. Always double check your work. Different tissues in the body give off different amounts of energy. A gentle introduction to MRI 1. 4 How do we translate magnetic fields into an image 2. org wiki Resting_state_fMRI Functional Visualizing 3D spatial mapsCredits to https www. 1 Preparing data 3. Let s know build our training set composed of multiple sets of features. The MRI scanner is essentially a giant magnet. These are subject level weights from a group level ICA independent component analysis decomposition of gray matter concentration maps from structural MRI sMRI scans. We know that there is no data leakage between patients since each patient has a unique id. 1 Preparing data 4. 4 Visualizing 3D spatial maps 3. com c mlsp 2014 mri overview A gentle introduction to MRI What is a MRI The Magnetisc Resonance Imaging MRI is non invasive test that produces detailed images of your brain and brain stem. One should not confound MRI CT scan and X ray. An appropriate pre processing needs to be tested. Submission This kenrel will be a work in progress and I will keep on updating it as the competition progresses and I gain more insight about the data. Sources https www. The distributions are bell shaped. We can obviously tune our RF pulse to be resonant with protons in other parts of the body like the feet if we were interested in imaging the feet How do we translate magnetic fields into an image When the RF pulse is turned off the protons flip back and realign along the main magnetic field B0. Water molecule is H2O meaning it is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Note that Fisher s definition means that the kurtosis of a Gaussian distribution is 0. Target distributionsThe train_scores. As the protons flip back and realign with B0 they give off energy. More specifically it can be defined as the temporal correlation between spatially remote neurophysiological events expressed as deviation from statistical independence across these events in distributed neuronal groups and areas. Age and domain 2 variables seems to have a slight skew. 3 How does a MRI actually work 1. Then we tune the RF pulse to the precessing frequency of the hydrogen protons in the head. Training Submission Ensemble Importing dependencies Loading train scores Plot the distribution of the target variables Compute statistics Decoration No NaN values in the DataFrame Loading. com zacktack data scientist journey neuroimaging lgbm For a deeper understanding https www. MRI uses magnetic fields and radio waves to measure how much water is in different tissues of the body maps the location of the water and then uses this information to generate a detailed image. At any moment in time all the billions of hydrogen protons in our bodies are all in random positions and spinning on their axes. In addition to the MRI images we are given several additional features to increase our model performance. We use something called a radio frequency RF pulse to disturb or flip all the protons at the same time out of alignment from the scanner s magnetic field. com watch v Gpa0Pgsx7SI https www. com aerdem4 rapids svm on trends neuroimaging and used feature engineering from https www. The images are so detailed because our bodies are made up of around 65 water so we have lots of signal to measure. Therefore only the protons in the brain will absorb energy from the RF pulse and be flipped away from the B0 field. csv file contains the targets that we need to predict. 2 SBM loadings 2. Due to the law of quantum physics there are always just slightly more up protons than down. To measure this emitted energy we require some special equipment called a coil that is placed around the body part we are imaging. What are functional network connectivity matrices Functional connectivity is the connectivity between brain regions that share functional properties. Furthermore the kurtosis is small meaning that there is not much weight in the tails. 1 Target distributions 2. com health head mri https kids. Data explorationAs you know the data is multimodal meaning that multiple features can be fed to a machine learning model. SBM loadingsPer the competition documentation The first set of features are source based morphometry SBM loadings. The electrical current is transformed via a Fourier transform. Data exploration 2. As you ll see the model works decently. com watch v Ok9ILIYzmaY Previous competitons https www. Visualize independent components IC Basic modellingFor a basic modelling using SVM I hhave used RAPIDS SVM as shown in Ahmet Erdem s kernel https www. 1 What is a MRI 1. This applies to both resting state and task state studies. If you find this kernel useful please consider upvoting it it motivates me to write more quality content. Indeed the target variables are normally distributed. Functional connectivity has also been evaluated using the perfusion time series sampled with arterial spin labeled perfusion fMRI. Since we still have relatively few features let s investigate the correlation between target variables and features. An MRI machnie creates the images using a magnetic field and radio waves. We apply a second magnetic field B1 that varies across the body. FNC correlationThis dataframe contains static FNC correlation features for both train and test samples. We call the scanners magnetic field the B0 field. com jafarib trends eda fe submission Preparing dataFor this model we will only be using basic features and not the actual MRI image. TReNDS Neuroimaging Data exploration Contents 1. png attachment image. 5 of domain1_var1 and domain1_var2 are missing. A MRI scan is different from a CT scan or an X ray in that it doesn t use radiation to produce images. 2 One should not confuse MRI CT scan and X ray 1. Advanced modelling 4. com soham1024 visualization using nilearnUsing soham1024 s function we change the dimensions of the 4d array that is in the Matlab file. We flip the axes such that the first two axes are the width and height. The frequency of the RF pulse must be the same as the frequency of the spinning hydrogen protons so they can exchange energy so that they are in resonance with each other. Resonance enables the protons to absorb enough energy from the RF pulse to rotate their axes away from the B0 field so that the MRI scanner can measure it. The coil acts as an antenna and detects the released energy as an electrical current. We can either drop them not the best strategy since we have only 5000 odd samples or use the mean or the column the option we choose here.
