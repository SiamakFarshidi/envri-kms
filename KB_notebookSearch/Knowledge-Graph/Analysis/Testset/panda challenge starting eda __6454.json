The objective is to predict isup_grade for each image in test set. All exams with ISUP grade 4 have Gleason score 4 4 majority 3 5 or 5 3. Discussion All exams with ISUP grade 0 have Gleason score 0 0 or negative. IntroductionThis Kernel objective is to explore the dataset for Prostate cANcer graDe Assessment PANDA Challenge. com data books 2471 murtagh7e_c114_f04. Test and sample submission csv files have only 3 rows samples. There are three files Sample submission Train Test. Let s see how Gleason score is grouped by Data source. Let s see how ISUP grade is distributed with respect of Data provider. Diagnosis of PCa is based on the grading of prostate tissue biopsies. Two research sources are present Karolinska Institute and Radboud University. Consequently there are 100 images with missing masks. This system is based primarily on the nucleoli assessment of the tumors as follows 1 Grade 1 Inconspicuous nucleoli at 400 magnification and basophilic Grade 2 Clearly visible nucleoli at 400 magnification and eosinophilic Grade 3 Clearly visible nucleoli at 100 magnification Grade 4 Extreme pleomorphism or rhabdoid and or sarcomatoid morphology Majority of data samples in train set have ISUP grade values 0 or 1 total 50 and the rest of the data samples have associated ISUP grades from 2 to 5 with all ranging in the 11 12 each. png The grading process consists of finding and classifying cancer tissue into so called Gleason patterns 3 4 or 5 based on the architectural growth patterns of the tumor see Figure below. All exams with ISUP grade 1 have Gleason score 3 3. References 1 YiFen Zhang MD PhD Pathology Grading of Renal Cell Carcinoma https emedicine. Gleason score 5 5Let s look now to few images and associated masks for samples with Gleason score 5 5. png Prepare the Data Analysis Load Packages Load the DataLet s load the tabular data. In train data there is a column gleason_score that is not present either in test with image_id data_provider or in sample submission image_id isup_grade csv. com kaggle media competitions PANDA Screen 20Shot 202020 04 08 20at 202. Let s see what images have missing masks. All exams with ISUP grade 2 have Gleason score 3 4. Most of the 0 1 ISUP Grade samples are originated from Karolinska. Data ExplorationLet s check distribution of data_provider isup_grade and gleason_score in train data. Let s now represent the distribution of image dimmensions width height the spacing and level_count also related to the other features namely data_provide isup_grade and gleason_score. For this visualization I reused the code from this Kernel https www. In the next Figure we show the principle of Gleason grading system. That means that besides the missing 100 mask images is no missing data all images indexed in train data has corresponding tiff images and only 100 tiff label masks are missing. Most of the 2 5 ISUP Grade samples are originated from Radboud. Gleason score 3 4Let s look now to images with Gleason score 3 4. For Karolinska next in terms of frequency are samples with Gleason score 3 3 3 4 4 4. These tissue samples are examined by a pathologist and scored according to the Gleason grading system. com rohitsingh9990 panda eda better visualization Masks samplesLet s show now the masks for the same images. Gleason score 4 5Let s look now to few images and associated masks for samples with Gleason score 4 5. Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer among males worldwide that results in more than 350k deaths annually. After the biopsy is assigned a Gleason score a combination of the two digits it is converted into an ISUP grade on a 1 5 scale using the correspondence matrix shown in the next Figure. We can observe that there are totally 10616 train images with same number 10616 corresponding images and only 10516 mask images. For this we will remove the suffix and extension from label masks and will remove the extension from image list. com rohitsingh9990 panda eda better visualization 3 Dhananjay Raut PANDA EDA All you need to know https www. This seems to be aligned with the correspondence matrix as shown in the following table The only misalignment is in the fact that for ISUP Grade 2 in the data we also have Gleason score 4 3 which also appears for ISUP Grade 3. All exams with ISUP grade 3 have Gleason score 4 3. com dhananjay3 panda eda all you need to know. The key to decreasing mortality is developing more precise screeening procedures and diagnostics. This data distribution can be better visualized using a heatmap. In 2012 the International Society of Urologic Pathologists ISUP proposed a novel validated grading system for clear cell renal cell carcinoma ccRCC and papillary renal cell carcinoma pRCC that has been implemented by the World Health Organization WHO. We can observe that all of the 0 0 Gleason score data samples are from Karolinska while from Radboud we have most of negative data. Based on presence of various formations the Gleason score is given for majority first digit in the score and minority Gleason score the second digit. For Radboud next in terms of frequency most frequent are samples with Gleason score 4 3 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 5. Let s check now the train data in train_images and train_label masks folders. Extract image characteristicsLet s parse all images for train data to extract image characteristics. The data is unbalanced with respect of Gleason score values distribution. com article 1612022 overview 2 Rohit Singh PANDA EDA Better Visualization https www. Both intersections with masks set cardinality is equal with the mask set data dimmensions. And intersection between train image ids and image equals train cardinality. Image samplesLet s plot some image samples from train_images. We compare now the intersections of sets of resulted lists. Missing DataLet s check for missing values in these lists. Let s check now relative distribution of ISUP grade anf Gleason score values. All exams with ISUP grade 5 have Gleason score 4 5 majority 5 4 or 5 5.
