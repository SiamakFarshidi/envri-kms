Data preprocess Reshape from samples timesteps into samples timesteps features. Set seeds to make the experiment more reproducible. Input shape samples timesteps. The thing with MLP models is that the model don t take the input as sequenced data so for the model it is just receiving inputs and don t treat them as sequenced data that may be a problem since the model won t see the data with the sequence patter that it has. Comparing models MLP on train and validation CNN on train and validation LSTM on train and validation CNN LSTM on train and validation ConclusionHere you could see some approaches to a time series problem how to develop and the differences between them this is not meant to have a great performance so if you want better results you are more than welcomed to try a few different hyper parameters especially the window size and the networks topology if you do please let me know the results. This same reshaped data will be used on the CNN and the LSTM model. com dimitreoliveira time series forecasting with lstm autoencoders data. The CNN will be defined to expect 2 timesteps per subsequence with one feature. Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting The goal of this notebook is to develop and compare different approaches to time series problems. LSTM for Time Series Forecasting Now the LSTM model actually sees the input data as a sequence so it s able to learn patterns from sequenced data assuming it exists better than the other ones especially patterns from long sequences. Model explanation from the article https machinelearningmastery. The filter maps are then flattened before being interpreted by a Dense layer and outputting a prediction. CNN LSTM for Time Series Forecasting Input shape samples subsequences timesteps features. The CNN model will interpret each sub sequence and the LSTM will piece together the interpretations from the subsequences. com how to get started with deep learning for time series forecasting 7 day mini course that I used as source. Content Time series visualization with ploty Basic EDA. As such we will split each sample into 2 subsequences of 2 times per subsequence. The convolutional layer should be able to identify patterns between the timesteps. t 1 Current timestep t 0 Target timestep t lag Put it all together Drop rows with NaN values Label. com How to Get Started with Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting 7 Day Mini Course https machinelearningmastery. com how to get started with deep learning for time series forecasting 7 day mini course The benefit of this model is that the model can support very long input sequences that can be read as blocks or subsequences by the CNN model then pieced together by the LSTM model. Input shape samples timesteps features. com how to get started with deep learning for time series forecasting 7 day mini course Dependencies Loading data Train set Time period of the train dataset Let s find out what s the time gap between the last day from training set from the last day of the test set this will be out lag the amount of day that need to be forecast Basic EDATo explore the time series data first we need to aggregate the sales by day Overall daily sales Daily sales by store Daily sales by item Sub sample train set to get only the last year of data and reduce training time Rearrange dataset so we can apply shift methods Transform the data into a time series problem We will use the current timestep and the last 29 to forecast 90 days ahead Drop rows with different item or store values than the shifted columns Remove unwanted columns Train validation split MLP for Time Series Forecasting First we will use a Multilayer Perceptron model or MLP model here our model will have input features equal to the window size. How to develop a Long Short Term Memory network model for a univariate time series forecasting problem LSTM for Time Series Forecasting. How to develop a Hybrid CNN LSTM model for a univariate time series forecasting problem CNN LSTM for Time Series Forecasting. The entire CNN model is then wrapped in TimeDistributed wrapper layers so that it can be applied to each subsequence in the sample. The results are then interpreted by the LSTM layer before the model outputs a prediction. The content here was inspired by this article at machinelearningmastery. How to transform a time series dataset into a supervised learning problem Transform the data into a time series problem. How to develop a Multilayer Perceptron model for a univariate time series forecasting problem MLP for Time Series Forecasting. How to develop a Convolutional Neural Network model for a univariate time series forecasting problem CNN for Time Series Forecasting. When using a hybrid CNN LSTM model we will further divide each sample into further subsequences. If you want to check out how you can use LSTM as autoencoders and create new features that represent a time series take a look at my other kernel Time series forecasting with deep learning LSTM autoencoders https www. CNN for Time Series Forecasting For the CNN model we will use one convolutional hidden layer followed by a max pooling layer. I hope you learned a few things here leave a feedback and if you liked what you saw make sure to check the article https machinelearningmastery.
