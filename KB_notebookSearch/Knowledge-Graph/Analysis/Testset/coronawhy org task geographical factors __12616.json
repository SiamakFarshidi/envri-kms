Date ranges will be incorporated into future functionality. Data Elaboration Cleaning steps aggregations and other operations are applied to the data if needed. Our Code All the work from task geo can be found in our Github repository https github. Currently we have comprehensive climate data available for visualization only in the country of Italy none of the other countries can be analyzed with this tool yet. Back to top top 10. Task Overview task_overview 3. This is displayed as a circle in the centre of a region the size displays the relative count. On the left side of the map are layers that correspond to COVID 19 prevalence. 5 would be equal distribution. Italy demographics demographics 7. Italy Meteorology Display Italy s COVID 19 cases along detailed meteorological information such as min max avg temperature humidity and atmospheric pressure. The code for this whole process is open source on our GitHub task_notebooks. In this visualization Group A corresponds to the COVID case statistic type deaths recovered active. Climate MetricsThere are a variety of layers included in display group B to represent climate such as average temperature minimum temperature relative humidity etc. We will fix this soon Back to top top 4. We have achieved some initial results but additional work is required in order to extract the important insights that would be useful to the research community at large. The extraction of geolocations on the original CORD 19 dataset. Defining Workflow workflow 10. Defining Workflow The current workflow for demographic data extraction is as follows. Geographical Data Visualization Tool task_visualization 4. Group BThese allow different options to show regional counts for COVID 19 s Cumulative tested cases number of active cases number of recovered patients and number of deaths. com dataset 08dd9ead3afd4f61ef246bfd6aee098765a19d9f6dbf514f0142965748be859b tasks taskId 558 submission https www.

The goal of the second line of work is to provide researchers with resources to confirm debate or extends claims and findings made in the papers contained in the CORD 19 dataset. In the center of the screen is a map that can be zoomed in out using the minus and plus buttons on the bottom left side of the screen. and temporal resolution dates.

If a region had a uniform distribution of ages they would all be white dots so this example from Emilia Romagna shows a lower proportion of under 29 s and an over representation of 40 59 year olds. Daily calls task_calls 13. The gathering of geopolitical and demographic data is at a more developed stage. Introduction introduction 2. Group C is an option that can allow data to be grouped specifically by region in the country. For example if the date April 12 is selected then the COVID statistics will display the accumulated cases up until April 12 and not the number of new cases recoveries deaths on April 12 only. com dataset 08dd9ead3afd4f61ef246bfd6aee098765a19d9f6dbf514f0142965748be859b tasks taskId 561 submission https www.

Back to top top 3. The climate data for each region can be accessed by hovering the mouse over one of the colored dots inside the map view the climate summary for the selected layer will be displayed above the cursor. The goal of the first line of work is to provide our teammates with additional insights about their findings like the location of clinical trials or reports and claims. Team calls We operate under radical transparency and all of our meetings calls are recorded feel free to review the historical progress and the way we reached this stage so far https trello. The focus aspects were selected in collaboration with task risk and task vt via in depth analysis of the CORD 19 dataset. Italy Mobility Display Italy s COVID 19 cases along mobility variations as on different categories. Back to top top 5. In the near future an automated extraction pipeline will be set up and will generate up to date datasets in a public repository. Select one and only 1 from each display group to populate the map with corresponding data see sections below for more details. Back to top top 2. Therefore even though the visualization has a built in slider to accommodate date range it does not work correctly yet. Automation and improvement of the paper geolocation process. In the database if there is a missing data point the database records the humidity value as 999 instead of NaN. We provide very granular datasets on various aspects related to the spread of the virus and the resulting mortality in the population. Geographical Data Visualization Tool OverviewA tool built with Carto for exploring geospatial relationships between COVID 19 prevalence by cases recovery and or fatality and geospatial properties climate and demographic factors at different geospatial resolution country region etc. Sources Population by different regional levels http demo. Our Code task_notebooks 11. Date selectionAlong the bottom of the screen there is a date picker. Formatting The extracted data is brought to a common format making it easy to use and to combine. These datasets have been brought in a standardized format in order to make them easy to use and to combine for researchers and the public at large.

Group CThis option only has one choice that colours the regions to display the population density measured in people per square kilometer. Credits task_credits 1. Our goal is not to draw any conclusion from the data but only to present it in a way that is as accessible as possible. At the current time the extraction of geolocations from the CORD 19 datast is at a preliminary stage. Task Overview Our work in task geo has been split in two different yet related lines of progression 1. Back to top top 8. Easy access for non technical researchers for the data we provide.
