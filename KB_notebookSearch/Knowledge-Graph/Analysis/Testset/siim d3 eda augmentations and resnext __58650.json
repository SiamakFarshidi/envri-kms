It helps to understand the size with a 3 dimensional spatial representatiion and at the same time helps to understand the limits of our image in a 3 dimensional scale. Albumentations erosion emsp emsp 8. png Due to RAM constraints this is how GridMask looks like https www. These are brownish spots also called giraffe spots. We also need to analyze how different these sort of skin growths are. Melanoma specifically is responsible for 75 of skin cancer deaths despite being the least common skin cancer. Lichenoid mimics the dangers of real carcinogenous growth with its halo s. Let s use only simple augmentations. Fourier method for pixel distributionsNow we move on to something more interesting Fourier transforms. mWTqxqQM59nQBlLwUBoPw. js to view categorical variables at a glance. Using patient level contextual information may help the development of image analysis tools which could better support clinical dermatologists. Our model needs to diagnose Target Benign Malignant DiagnosisWe will also try some preprocessing ideas such as Reducing lighting condition effects as we will see images come with many different lighting conditions some images are very dark and difficult to visualize. Why is it so Well medically most of the time cancer patients only reach cancerous conditions with malignant tumors. Introduction Let s look at first 20 files From this we can infer a LOT of domain knowledge such as The diagnosis feature is a simple diagnosis of the cancer. Are they all similar of different Do they look the same or not And do they have the all too well known visceral orange halo We shall see. What about test Middle aged people are the most likely to get cancer whereas those on the RHS and LHS of the plot are least likely to get it. This is simple enough if one bothers to take a look one patient has more than 114 growths. Think of circle crop as C and think of auto cropping as C. Albumentations library demonstration emsp emsp 8. Explanation of our method emsp emsp 2. Notes This is from https www. maybe not Circle cropCircular crop has successfully worked although it may not be feasible for images where the tumor is on the edge of the image. Nothing too complex just our circle crop augmentation will be enough to replicate the effect on some other images. NormalizationWe use normalization to evenly distribute something across an image we can use normalization to for example normalize lighting conditions across the image. It has a number of symptoms like Bleeding Patchy skin Light eye color etc. e in this instance the growth is white and the halo surrrounding area is blackened. So I have to rerun it a lot because the errors are sometime random and I need to circumvent it. The benign_malignant feature is a feature that determines whether the tumor is benign or malignant benign is harmless malignant is harmful The anatom_site_general_challenge tells us where the cancer is. It was originally used for Data Science Bowl 2017 by Guido Zuldhof but I have adapted it for here this competition. ly it is a real toll on my poor computer with 3 gigabyte RAM Will add plotly visualizations later. It is also observable that we have a class distribution in target with many more 0 s than 1 s I am poor at d3. In the cases without a halo I think that it means that the patient is having a malignant tumor but has not reached critical levels of cancer yet. Seborrheic and lichenoid keratosis are both rather similar. Ben Graham s method from first competition emsp emsp emsp 8. Now we can view malignant tumors Malignant image viewing 4. This helps us see some parts of the growth and also it lets us see the images and the halos in small amounts. Here we can see the trees in the data and the grouping codes are modified from Shivam Bansal s work. Melanoma in most cases displays the vicious and visceral orange halo as it devours alive other poor cells who where unlucky enough to cross its path. It will be a bit difficult for the model to learn anything from this due to the complete and utter confusion pardon me in the image with regard to the clear distinctions between image segments and there is no disctinction between parts of the image. Melanoma Skin cancer s form what we are working with Seborrheic keratosis Brown waxy and patchy growths that are not related to skin cancer. From Nevus pigmentatious growth we can observe that nevus also has an orange halo which is not so visceral and pronounced. Dermatologists could enhance their diagnostic accuracy if detection algorithms take into account contextual images within the same patient to determine which images represent a melanoma. Image segmentation emsp emsp 8. If successful classifiers would be more accurate and could better support dermatological clinic work. Neuron Engineer s methodHere we can finally visualize the clear distinctions in our data. Due to RAM Constraints I will display only the images of CutMix and MixUp CutMix https www. com kmader skin cancer mnist ham10000 Skin Lesion Images for Melanoma Classification https www. looks like the Conjuring now. the ability to share images across technology and clinical platforms. It s also expected that almost 7 000 people will die from the disease. com c siim isic melanoma classification description. As with other cancers early and accurate detection potentially aided by data science can make treatment more effective. We need to isolate malignant tumors from all this. 80 percent of all the cases here are unknown. Combination of erosion and dilation emsp emsp 8. It will not damage anythin it s just a small blot on the landscape of your skin. Benign and malignant tumors What is a benign tumor A benign tumor put simply is one that will not cause any cancerous growth. jdCubfO gaFURT7SF4sIqQ __results___files __results___90_0. We can try to convert the image to gray scale and visualize better. it involves utilizing grayscale images as well as a gaussian blur afterwards. js so it may not look that way. CutMix MixUp AugMix and GridMask This is probably the most famous augmentation method in recent history. Auto croppingNow we are using auto cropping as a method of preprocessing which is a more refined circle crop if you will. Image preprocessing emsp emsp 7. A finer method for image segmentationThis is a finer form of image segmentation where we use a second threshold to finetune our segmented data in a sort of way. Background subtractionAnother thing you can do is background subtraction. Image segmentationThis is called image segmentation. The data is split into fold chunks where fold is the n_splits parameter of our model and the training data is then passed to the model. rCbILKa3mSHswXZAKu4cxN_7nrFcFMyhAIb2nLfaMaqv61Q0ByPYzoIwVFVlTt5Awre_NajFwfjRGCU7FoMUqOTKcRP1uNl4 myKV4tiTYakMhArR849e4LZmLYITaxX MTDqEHtp4HHQwVewgcf4h1ocIQZ5BEe4IbgcKqItjS3a27djq8TdOvMr693UEAXTx3vNjBZy5 AjzbqPDKpJysg_FzDeOEqS_c0FYZb4O2KksjgL9eq1u4hzw6itrFXhArvXLaAo QQDH7oK58YvS1h9jTsrKtk6AzMyDrBhyYCTSNhlP2Uqq__3LkjtcB0DpHPx2mdkf7JbNx8W_2C6JCsL7zv0XEuoBhNBNNmXSPyFmn0med1CgEMEV4oF2vgQ4Cnjm8EVllfchq1U0E73W_9NYW7WCAP76rNI5VsrbCa0l_g4sPzCJEiBd2WH9bOv3NefF_rogNO0Pa4mTYgsuUyE9XgbFriIfceZZEov4Zae4jSLiLe4cmrfmmiGKUUb94hMb dPSkHkfL2nL8ab9zs1rGbmtUcnKlJGiU3witwH9kr B2ydvLUephf1QU9JTAfLb5DzmFnDyGDlOh_Um1Q0VOeFCKoWXASgYeKJQ__HmaYdFT3AE0RNZiPj yAN0XedIv5nlwBr8APoT_aQ SeA0nS_2aI1oZeUQvxflhclzMV UUBerPjQ2O iDJE. pdf AWSAccessKeyId AKIA2FPBP3II4S6KTWEU Signature E3f4iijeBEYmUWuhJUJtFLi 2Fx 2Fw 3D Expires 1591213432 2nd place http www. We can also get a touchy feely sense of this whole thing with Plot. Better detection of melanoma has the opportunity to positively impact millions of people. About SIIM ISIC organization emsp C. This green halo could be a special characteristic of lentigo that could help our model to distinguish lentigo from other carcinogenic growths. shape sure background area Finding sure foreground area Finding unknown region sure background area Finding sure foreground area Finding unknown region Add one to all labels so that sure background is not 0 but 1 Now mark the region of unknown with zero The first parameter is the original image kernel is the matrix with which image is convolved and third parameter is the number of iterations which will determine how much you want to erode dilate a given image. This is a very basic way to add noise it s known as salt and pepper noise. It will be coming shortly as soon as I figure out how to properly work with MONAI. This archive serves as a public resource of images for teaching and for the development and testing of automated diagnostic systems. What is a malignant tumor A malignant tumor is the evil twin of the benign tumor it causes cancerous growth. Attack the modelHow do we think that a model can classify something correctly How do we measure whether small disturbances in image like adding a noise or a random flip or something can affect whether an image is benign or malignant Could we measure peturbance or rather how much the model has been affected in any way Attacking a machine learning model or adversarial learning is by no means a new technique it s been around for a while. image is too dark so that we crop out everything return original image image is too dark so that we crop out everything return original image. APPENDIX C ISIC Winner Solutions 1st place https isic challenge stade. Albumentations library demonstrationAlso you can use the albumentations library to create a lot of simulated images for your model. As grim as this may sound remember that in this scenario we are supposed to be helping the doctors do their duty. Benign image viewingThese are the first 30 melanoma images with benign tumors. The patients growths could potientially be similar so we can observe the similarities between the growths. ISIC is developing proposed standards to address the technologies techniques and terminology used in skin imaging with special attention to the issues of privacy and interoperability i. So we can see that the percentage of missing values doubles in anatom_site_general_challenge from train to test. Existing AI approaches have not adequately considered this clinical frame of reference. Ben Graham s method on training set emsp emsp emsp 8. Go to Post Cornell Birdcall EDA An EDA for the cornell birdcall competition Go to Post Some preprocessing methods are from Neuron Engineer and Ben Graham credit where credit is due. What I think this means is that the orange halo occurs when the patient has reached stage 3 stage 4 of serious cancerous growth. In particular you ll use images within the same patient and determine which are likely to represent a melanoma. I ll be excluding Unknown for the purpose of clarity. Age Age is an important factor in carciongenous growth because it helps you to understand who is more vulnerable at an early age and who is more vulnerable at later stages of their life.

APPENDIX A Melanoma APPENDIX B ISIC Overview Source https www. Benign and malignant tumors emsp emsp 3. TF Dataloaders are very slow but they are effective in a way. We can see that in age middle aged people are more likely to get melanoma and cancer in general as studies have shown than people before and past their prime. Here we have 3 batches 3 folds where the data can be separated to. Attack the model with adversarial learningAppendix emsp A. Baseline modeling emsp emsp 10. We have significantly more benign tumors than malignant ones. A simple enough attack would be to slightly alter an image by adding some noise.

My other works Transformer XL Intro and Baseline A guide to the transformer architecture and its application in m5. It breals down an image into its constituent parts represented by the distinction between regions i. Image Preprocessing Why is preprocessing any different from augmentation Preprocessing is basically a filter augmentation is basically adding more variations of the same image. Melanoma is a deadly disease but if caught early most melanomas can be cured with minor surgery. A finer form of image segmentation emsp emsp 8. One could indeed fathom that the torso is frequently exposed either during the occasional workout or the occasional swim or in some cases the occasional extreme adventure. 3 dimensional augmentation techniques As you have seen here it is possible for one to make use of 3 dimensional images in this competition. Circle crop was first formulated by Tom Aindow and exemplified by Neuron Engineer during the APTOS competition see their effect. Albumentations dilation and erosion emsp emsp 8. 3 dimensional grayscale images emsp emsp 10. However the torso has more square area than any other affected part so it seems like the area on a body part is correlated with number of cases on that body part as we can see. Grayscale image segmentationThese are now the segmented grayscale images complete with markers. lentigo has not only the orange halo of death but also the green halo which could be what distinguishes lentigo from melanoma I m not great at biology. Let s define a simple KFold cross validation that we should be able to use in some way. com kf 35223031 eyJhbGciOiJkaXIiLCJlbmMiOiJBMTI4Q0JDLUhTMjU2In0. Ben Graham s method from 1st competitionThe first method we will use is Ben Graham s method from the first diabetic retionpathy detection competition. In this notebook I shall give you an overview of the new SIIM ISIC Melanoma Detection competition and also a brief overview into our data augmentation techniques using the python library albumentations. EDIT As of 19 06 2020 I have removed grassroots modeling section. That makes it sort of unavoidable really if you get it because heart and lung cancer are localized to just one area whereas melanoma can sprout literally anywhere. It is helpful to understand where the majority of the growth is concentrated. Here however we can implement multiple noises from a glance. Past Winner s Solutions Skin cancer is the most prevalent type of cancer. Now the splitter sort of splits the data into chunks by adding a certain feature to the data which determines which batch fold the data should go in. com 99bdfa5c 4b6b 4c3c 94c0 f614e6a05bc4 method_description. Let s check the distribution of values in benign_malignant. uint8 img. shape 1 2 random. Lentigo NOS A type of skin cancer that starts from the outside of the skin and attacks by going inword. So we have a bell Gaussian or normal distribution of train data. Grayscale images emsp emsp 8. Auto cropping indeed is powerful but the risk is that you will lose valuable data in the image. You are free to go back to older versions and check the sections on grassroots modeling over there. In addition ISIC has developed and is expanding an open source public access archive of skin images to test and validate the proposed standards. shape 0 2 15 0 0 0 1 mask circle 255 img np. Malignant image viewing4. CutMix MixUp and GridMask12. It would be interesting to read in a DICOM file and soak in all the metadata. To put it into perspective PyTorch data loaders are much more fast than TF dataloaders and the only reason we are using TF here is because of keras. It looks rather gargantuan but fundamentally it is just an overglorified convolutional neural network with some bells and whistles and a lot of layers at that too K Fold Cross ValidationSo as it seems like the train set is 3 times bigger than the test set it makes sense for us to use a 3 fold cross validation split using sklearn s RepeatedKFold class. Background subtraction emsp emsp 8. Why To help our model identify the tumors correctly even in grayscale colormap. png MixUp https www. 63LkdMRmfzzZaD0K20kflQ. Image analysis tools that automate the diagnosis of melanoma will improve dermatologists diagnostic accuracy. Remember your model MUST BE ABLE TO GENERALIZE We have much more augmentations we can try like Mess around with p Not done yet We still have a few more tricks namely erosion and dilation. cn WORK IN PROGRESS If you liked it please upvote Images Example Print the first 5 Function to calculate missing values by column Funct Total missing values Percentage of missing values Make a table with the results Rename the columns Sort the table by percentage of missing descending Print some summary information Return the dataframe with missing information Missing values statistics Embedding the html string Coding Backgrounds Fancy indexing verts faces to generate a collection of triangles added the grid lines for pixel purposes BY SERGEI ISSAEV added the grid lines for pixel purposes image is too dark so that we crop out everything return original image img is image data tol is tolerance image is too dark so that we crop out everything return original image print img1. Baseline Modeling While everyone is trying to use EfficientNet and transfer learning I think that it is indeed great but we need to try to IMPLEMENT ideas on our own. We also are using the DICOM file type here. About Melanoma emsp B. Solar lentigo Like lentigo but caused by UV rays from the sun very common in Delhi cafe au lait macule French for coffee with milk. As such if anyone is bold or foolhardy enough to try these I shall make a guide for you to use these. Erosion emsp emsp 8. In this competition you ll identify melanoma in images of skin lesions. As expected we have a HUGE class distribution here we will need to use undersampling or oversampling to deal with this. Lichenoid keratosis It is a thin pigmented sort of plaque if you will. atypical melanocytic proliferation Abnormal quantities of melanin appear on the skin. Fourier method for image pixel distributions emsp emsp 8. Our earlier hypothesis now has more depth to it with half approximately of the skin cancer cases located in the torso. org resource resmgr home jdi_banner 2000x550. Benign tumors are frequently the first signs of cancerous growth pacing the way for the malignant tumors. Currently dermatologists evaluate every one of a patient s moles to identify outlier lesions or ugly ducklings that are most likely to be melanoma. One class for configuration and hyperparameters.

Circle crop emsp emsp 8. I would like to think of the orange halo as being an event horizon of some sort a point of no return for a killed cell unless chemotherapy of course. multiply img mask return img def __repr__ self return f self. However it has a heavy downside as we lose all information inside and outside the growth and thus our model loses the capability to understand or learn something from the image. Literally 80 percent. TrainNow we try it on the test set TestNice But we can further observe the clear color distinctions by using Neuron Engineer s method an improved version of Ben Graham s. Complex Wavelet Transform9. When recognized and treated in its earliest stages melanoma is readily curable. I will demonstrate 2 methods Implementation from grassroots our own model Keras pretrained models. We can try the method of Ben Graham Cropping uninformative area everyone know this Here I just find the codes from internet and choose the best one for you 1. Now for missing values Now we can see the percentages of missing values. It also could be that the torso was exposed to UV light which is the cause of melanoma in highly populated regions where pollution allows the sun s UV rays to come in. Let s see where the most frequent amounts of cancerous growth occur It seems like we have a lot of issues with the torso and after that the extremities of the body upper lower. A recommended approach would be to resample the images before plotting it like this. Remember you can build upon Ben Graham s work as a starting point then try Neuron Engineer s or circle crop or even build you own method. p p def __call__ self img if random. It helps our model to visually understand the distinctions even better than using grayscale images and it also helps to let our model identify the tumor. What comes out is the magnitude spectrum of the image. Application of our method3. Now we can train the model. A neat trick wth 3 dimensional visualization emsp emsp 2. If you like do remember to upvote as that s where I get my motivation from. Lichenoid is very good at mimicking other forms of cancer. The clear regions the clear color differences the clear everything This is probably the best preprocessing method that we can apply. We have about 100 200 cases of cancer in the mouth or genitalia the areas with the lowest rate of cancerous growth and the palms and soles also are safe probably because they are not exposed to any external sources in the day to day life of the person. Dilation emsp emsp 8. A finer form of image segmentation Grayscale form emsp emsp 8. So here I am going to use Depthwise Spatial Convolutions instead of normal Conv2D layers.

Diagnosis OK so let s look at the diagnosis feature We have seven types of diagnosed cancerous growths here Unkown a possibly novel type of growth Nevus from Google a usually non cancerous disorder of pigment producing skin cells commonly called birth marks or moles. 2 percent missing values. com andrewmvd isic 2019 I got this from Alex Shonenkov s brilliant kernel https www. Here we can clearly see what is inside the image and where the isolated cells are it forms a figure vaguely resemblant of a skull. Ben Graham s method on testing set emsp emsp 8. And well cancerous growth on cells is never a good thing. Atypical melanocytic proliferation combines the scary things about melanoma and lentigo and brings them in one place complete with both halos. We now have found out that there is a bell curve distribution for age. Here we have to try and implement these ideas. Albumentations dilation emsp emsp 8. NOTE I HAVE COMMENTED THIS BECAUSE IT TAKES A LOT OF TIME I have trained the model for only a few epochs because of time constraints. So how do we do that With the magic of dataframe indexing In each malignant tumor we can observe that the tumor has a visceral orange halo in some cases and in other cases it does not. I will use TensorFlow dataloaders over here to run the model. Currently a lack of standards for dermatologic imaging undermines the quality and usefulness of skin lesion imaging. Image Augmentations We need to use image augmentations to add to our existing set of data. It does not seem so feasible so I would recommend you try to be smarter in your methods for preprocessing. I will be using just one simple class Config for defining all the configuration and hyperparameters for accessibility. Neuron Engineer s method from APTOS emsp emsp 8. SIIM ISIC EDA and AugmentationHello all and welcome. Alternatively there is a better approach. CutMix MixUp and AugMix are all very popular nowadays so I have given it a go here using TPUs. Back to our general EDA now. Grassroots bulding from scratch emsp emsp 10. Digital images of skin lesions can be used to educate professionals and the public in melanoma recognition as well as directly aid in the diagnosis of melanoma through teledermatology clinical decision support and automated diagnosis. Grayscale imagesWe will first try to visualize in grayscale only gray colors so that it is possible for us to clearly visualize the varied differences in color region and shape. The American Cancer Society estimates over 100 000 new melanoma cases will be diagnosed in 2020. Clarification with multiple versionsWith these multiple versions I m trying to change some stuff in the notebook some tuning some new augmentation or something but most of the time I get some Kaggle Notebooks errors. This can be confusing as our model can mix up this orange halo and the other orange haloNow that is cancer. Stage 3 and Stage 4 the most critical level conditions of cancer are only reached when the patient is in serious trouble.
