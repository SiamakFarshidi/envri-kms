Create an entity set a collection of entities tables and their relationships Create an entity clicks based on pandas dataframe and add it to the entity set We need to set proper types so that Featuretools won t treat them as numericals We can create new enities based on information we have e. They are applied to a single entity. They are applied across a parent child relationship in an entity set. We normalize the entity and extract a new one this automatically adds a relationship between them How our entityset looks like Run Deep Feature Synthesis for app as a target entity features will be create for each app List of created features The features values Create feature with your own primitives List of created features Tell Featuretools to add time when entity was last seen. Feature primitives The units building blocks of Featuretools Computations applied to raw datasets to create new features Constrains the input and output data types Two types of primitives aggregation and transform Aggregation vs Transform Primitive 1. Automated feature engineering using Featuretools What s Featuretools a python library to perform automated feature engineering. Aggregation primitives These primitives take related instances as an input and output a single value. Only data prior to this time will be used. com static papers DSAA_DSM_2015. com Source code https github. Training window specifies the time to calculate features. Only data after this time will be used. based on Deep Feature Synthesis paper research Documentation https docs. pdf Article https www. g Count Sum AvgTimeBetween. com blog deep feature synthesis DFS works with the structured transactional and relational datasets Across datasets features are derived by using primitive mathematical operations New features are composed from using derived features hence Deep 1. Handling time Featuretools designed to take time into consideration Entities have a column time index that specifies the point in time when data in that row became available Cutoff Time specifies the time to calculate features.
