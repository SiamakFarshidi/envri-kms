Data Analysis 3 4. My Other KernelsClick on the button to view kernel. But we need to repeat the first value to close the circular graph What will be the angle of each axis in the plot we divide the plot number of variable Initialise the spider plot Draw one axe per variable add labels labels yet Draw ylabels Plot data Fill area DROP UNNECESSARY VALUES Turn Real Face into a binary indicator variable Turn Preferred Foot into a binary indicator variable Create a simplified position varaible to account for all player positions Get a count of Nationalities in the Dataset make of list of those with over 250 Players our Major Nations Replace Nationality with a binary indicator variable for Major Nation Create a copy of the original dataframe to avoid indexing errors Apply changes to dataset to create new column Split the Work Rate Column in two Create new column for first work rate Create new column for second work rate Drop original columns used Split ID as a Target value Splitting into test and train One Hot Encoding Applying Linear Regression Finding the r2 score and root mean squared error Top 3 important features are Potential Age Reactions Visualising the results. It motivates me to produce more quality content Image https images. Firstly most of the people are right footed xD Some unusual behavior in Potential vs Overall Accelaration and SprintSpeed follow a proper linear relationship Agility vs SprintSpeed Agility vs Accelaration and Agility vs Stamina have somewhat linear relationship 5. jpg t 1305899489 quality 60 w 1600 Table of Contents1. Glimpse of the data at hand 1 2. Exploratory Data Analysis 4 5. FIFA EDA and Linear Regression Starter IntroductionFIFA 19 is a football simulation video game developed by EA Vancouver as part of Electronic Arts FIFA series. EDA wirh R3 IDEnsemble Learning Part 1Ensemble Learning Part 2Students performance in Exams EDA in depth Pulmonary Embolism Dicom preprocessing EDA Titanic Machine Learning from Disaster Graduate Admission Chances Flower_Classification Augmentations EDAStorytelling with GWD pre_print data If these kernels impress you give them an Upvote. Go to TOP Number of countries available and top 5 countries with highest number of players Total number of clubs present and top 5 clubs with highest number of players Player with maximum Potential and Overall Performance Cleaning some of values so that we can interpret them Top earners number of variable We are going to plot the first line of the data frame. Data Cleaning 48 is repeating many times lets check if all of them are same ID or notAs they are same I am assuming it will be same for other all columns too. Please upvote this kernel if you like it. Exploratory Data Analysis Potential tends to fall as you grow oldSource of below visualisations fifa19 analysis https www. As we can see we guessed right and now we have fewer null values. However we will have a deep analysis in this notebook. com dczerniawko fifa19 analysis As the age increases the sprint speed decreases Left Footed Players vs Right Footed Players Crossing vs Dribbling Relation between potential and age with respected value of players Lowest correlation among the goalkeeping side with other columns and high among themselves High correlation between Dribbling Volleys Passing etc. Data Cleaning 2 3. It is the 26th installment in the FIFA series and was released on 28 September 2018 for PlayStation 3 PlayStation 4 Xbox 360 Xbox One Nintendo Switch and Microsoft Windows Source Wikipedia https en. Modelling 5 1. Glimpse of the data at hand 2. ModellingPermutation importance is the first tool for understanding a machine learning model and involves shuffling individual variables in the validation data after a model has been fit and seeing the effect on accuracy. We will have comparisions for Age Overall Potential Accelaration SprintSpeed Agility Stamina Strength From the plot we can infer many things.
