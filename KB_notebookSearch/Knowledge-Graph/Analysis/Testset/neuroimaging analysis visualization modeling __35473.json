However every row should be predicted in the submission file. How Brain MRI is done Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head is a painless noninvasive test that produces detailed images of your brain and brain stem. It does this by measuring metabolic changes that take place in your brain when you perform certain tasks. Train Scores Targets train_scores. There are various ways to visualize 3D spatial maps other than plot_stat_map. Sub cortical Network SCN Features First FNC feature sub group is SCN features. Niimg like objects. An MRI scan combines images to create a 3 D picture of your internal structures so it s more effective than other scans at detecting abnormalities in small structures of the brain such as the pituitary gland and brain stem. Then these templates were projected onto the original imaging data of each subject used for this competition using spatially constrained independent component analysis scICA via group information guided ICA GIG ICA. keys method shows us there is only one key in the file and it is SM_feature. Finally 3D spatial maps can be loaded as a Niimg like object with nilearn. The exact size of a voxel varies depending on the technology. Site Classification Even though it is impossible to predict the sites of unlabeled samples perfectly shifted features can be used in a classifier and predict the sites to some degree. This is the smallest sub group of fnc features and there are 10 features in it. It means data is collected from two different sources site 1 and 2. new_img_like by using the fMRI_mask. This explains the repeating orange and blue color blocks along the vertical and horizontal axis and repeating bright red and orange diagonal lines. 5 indicates that we keep nominal of amount nonzero voxels across all maps less the threshold means that more intense non voxels will be survived. There are 5877 samples in both fMRI_train and fMRI_test. Every cross correlation of CON have very strong correlations inside the second network groups. Sites reveal_ID_site2. Slightly shifted train test feature distributions are shifted even more in site 1 2. All of the data in training set is collected from site 1. Those are skipped in the score calculation. Those features are named from IC_01 to IC_30 but IC_19 IC_23 IC_25 and IC_27 don t exist. CBN X _vs_ADN Y X is strongly correlated with every different Y value for ADN CBN X _vs_SCN Y X is strongly correlated with every different Y value for SCN CBN X _vs_SMN Y X is strongly correlated with every different Y value for SMN CBN X _vs_VSN Y X is strongly correlated with every different Y value for VSN CBN X _vs_CON Y X is strongly correlated with every different Y value for CON CBN X _vs_DMN Y X is strongly correlated with every different Y value for DMN CBN X _vs_CBN Y X is strongly correlated with every different Y value for CBN Every cross correlation of CBN have moderate correlations inside the first network groups. This sub group has cross correlations with only itself. These are the subject level cross correlation values among 53 component timecourses estimated from GIG ICA of resting state functional MRI fMRI. Two features is_train and site are created for labeling different datasets and sites. This is the second largest sub group and there are 315 features in it. 9 train test split can be achieved with samples which slightly look like they are from site 2. To make it more interesting the IDs of some site 2 subjects have been revealed below. There are some data points which can be classified as mild outliers in all loading features. They can be trained and predicted with a single model or 5 different models. SMN X _vs_ADN Y X is strongly correlated with every different Y value for ADN SMN X _vs_SCN Y X is strongly correlated with every different Y value for SCN SMN X _vs_SMN Y X is strongly correlated with every different Y value for SMN Every cross correlation of SMN have moderate correlations inside the first network groups. Neuroimaging falls into two broad categories Structural imaging which deals with the structure of the nervous system and the diagnosis of gross large scale intracranial disease such as a tumor and injury. SCN features are strongly correlated with each other but none of the SCN features are correlated with targets. 159 on public leaderboard it scored 0. Those features should be eliminated. Plotting ROIs or a maskwhen mapping brain connectivities ROIs provide the structural substrates for measuring connectivities within individual brains and for pooling data across populations. ADN features are strongly correlated with each other if only ADN is cross correlated with SCN. This paragraph is taken from the data tab. 3D Plots of statistical maps or atlases on the cortical surface WHAT DO WE DO TO MISSING VALUES There are several options for handling missing values each with its own PROS and CONS. This explains the repeating orange and blue color blocks along the vertical and horizontal axis. pyplot as plt from nilearn import datasets from nilearn import plotting In a Jupyter notebook if view is the output of a cell it will be displayed below the cell view. After the 3D spatial maps are loaded as Niimg like objects they can be iterated with nilearn. For example running this by clicking run or pressing Shift Enter will list all files under the input directory It s necessary to reorient the axes since h5py flips axis order Giving less importance to FNC features since they are easier to overfit due to high dimensionality. CON X _vs_ADN Y X is strongly correlated with every different Y value for ADN CON X _vs_SCN Y X is strongly correlated with every different Y value for SCN CON X _vs_SMN Y X is strongly correlated with every different Y value for SMN CON X _vs_VSN Y X is strongly correlated with every different Y value for VSN CON X _vs_CON Y X is strongly correlated with every different Y value for CON Every cross correlation of CON have weak correlations inside the first network groups. Visual Network VSN Features Fourth FNC feature sub group is VSN features. visualization using nilearn EDA Sample Submission Create Submission Further Analysis Plotting 4D probabilistic atlas maps. the specific part of the brain. Those plotting functions are plot_glass_brain plot_roi plot_anat plot_epi and plot_img. The underlying brain model is generated through MRI scans so that the EEG data is accurately mapped to an individual s brain model. If None is given the image is not thresholded. However all features from the same part of the brain are not necessarily correlated with each other so there is no pattern here. Each voxel represents the activity of a specific volume in three dimensional space. csv are not the original age and raw assessment values. csv sMRI SBM loadings for both train and test samples. 171305 Validation NAE 0. nii files can be load from filenames or list of filenames with nilearn as well. This operation ceils the values greater than. Glass Brain is a tool that maps the electrical activity of your brain in realtime. First argument anatomical image and by default edges will be displayed as red r to choose different colors green g and blue b. Their distributions and descriptive statistical summary in training and test samples are very similar except IC_20. As seen before we call the plot_anat function with a background image as first argument in this case again the mean fMRI image and argument cut_coords as list for manual cut with coordinates pointing at masked brain regions Now use add_contours in display object with the path to a mask image from the Haxby dataset as first argument and argument levels given as list of values to select particular level in the contour to display and argument colors specified as red r to see edges as red in color. Thus identification of reliable reproducible and accurate ROIs is critically important for the success of brain connectivity mapping. Correlations between target and SCN features are very weak which can be seen at the bottom and right end. Adjustments are made based on the number of resels in the image and the theory of continuous random fields in order to set a new criterion for statistical significance that adjusts for the problem of multiple comparisons. However age is not rounded to year higher precision in the test set. This relationship is not easy to detect but it looks like age is easier to predict than other target features. net users legend_guide. This sub group has cross correlations with SCN 10 and itself 1. This sub group has cross correlations with SCN 45 ADN 18 SMN 81 and itself 36. They are parts of brain and their explanations are listed below IC_01 CerebellumIC_02 ACC mpfcIC_03 CaudateIC_04 CerebellumIC_05 CalcarineIC_06 CalcarineIC_07 Precuneus PCCIC_08 FrontalIC_09 IPL AGIC_10 MTGIC_11 FrontalIC_12 SMAIC_13 Temporal PoleIC_14 Temporal Pole FusiformIC_15 STGIC_16 Middle Occipital IC_17 CerebellumIC_18 CerebellumIC_20 MCCIC_21 Temporal Pole CerebellumIC_22 Insula CaudateIC_24 IPL PostcentralIC_26 Inf Mid FrontalIC_28 CalcarineIC_29 MTGIC_30 Inf Frontal 2. 3D visualizations can be thresholded with threshold parameter as well. For older versions see the note section above for details. If this threshold is set to. This means that a separate unrelated large imaging dataset was utilized to learn feature templates. mat files in this competition can be read in Python using h5py. Every cross correlation of DMN have very strong correlations inside the second network groups. All of the data collected from site 2 are in test set but the entire test set is not collected from site 2. This means the private leaderboard score will be even worse. Source based Morphometry Loadings The first set of features are source based morphometry SBM loadings. It is an exception because the distribution of IC_20 in test samples is shifted. Plotting an anatomical imageMain Idea of this visualization technique is to provide the anatomical picture of the brain. How Features Were ObtainedAn unbiased strategy was utilized to obtain the provided features. Data points of loading features are scattered around the means of domain1_var1 domain1_var2 domain2_var1 domain2_var2 however age has a tiny relationship with loading features. Since the feature names are sorted by alphabetical order the correlations of feature groups are easy to detect. VSN X _vs_ADN Y X is strongly correlated with every different Y value for ADN VSN X _vs_SCN Y X is strongly correlated with every different Y value for SCN VSN X _vs_SMN Y X is strongly correlated with every different Y value for SMN VSN X _vs_VSN Y X is strongly correlated with every different Y value for VSN Every cross correlation of VSN have moderate correlations inside the first network groups. Those features are for both training and test samples. It is a single data point and it s locations are very close in every target. Functional imaging which is used to diagnose metabolic diseases and lesions on a finer scale such as Alzheimer s disease and also for neurological and cognitive psychology research and building brain computer interfaces. To see contours with color fillings use argument filled True. nii a 3D binary spatial map. Just call fit to process for regions extraction Extracted regions are stored in regions_img_ Each region index is stored in index_ Total number of regions extracted Visualization of region extraction results First we need to do subjects timeseries signals extraction and then estimating correlation matrices on those signals. These are subject level weights from a group level ICA decomposition of gray matter concentration maps from structural MRI sMRI scans. fMRI_test a folder containing 53 3D spatial maps for test samples in. Nonetheless they are directly derived from the original assessment values and thus associations with the provided features is equally likely. Private Leaderboard Simulation If the expected values predicted by the site classifier are rounded there are 32 samples classified as site 2. 176281 Validation NAE 0. This means there are 311481 3D spatial maps in both fMRI_train and fMRI_test and this is the reason why competition data is 166. It looks like FNC features don t contribute site classifier model as much as loading features. DROP MISSING VALUESFILL MISSING VALUES WITH TEST STATISTIC mean median mode. Those features are age domain1_var1 domain1_var2 domain2_var1 and domain2_var2. Expected values closer to 1 and 2 in site_predicted could possible be added to the original site feature since they are confident predictions. All subjects from site 2 were assigned to the test set so their scores are not available. A functional MRI fMRI of the brain is useful for people who might have to undergo brain surgery. csv are merged on Id. csv file without Id. Models are expected to generalize on data from a different scanner site site 2. In particular neuroimaging specialists look for measurable markers of behavior health or disorder to help identify relevant brain regions and their contribution to typical or symptomatic effects. This is a very large sub group compared to previous ones and there are 180 features in it. This test is also known as a brain MRI or a cranial MRI. If the KS statistic is small or the p value is high then we cannot reject the hypothesis that the distributions of the two samples are the same. The estimated deformation fields are then applied to the subject s EPI scans functional or diffusion weighted images to warp the latter to a template space. This sub group has cross correlations with SCN 45 ADN 18 and itself 36. An MRI machine creates the images using a magnetic field and radio waves. This sub group has cross correlations with SCN 35 ADN 14 SMN 63 VSN 63 CON 119 and itself 21. It is a relatively new discipline within medicine neuroscience and psychology. CBN X _vs_ADN Y Y is strongly correlated with every different X value for ADN CBN X _vs_SCN Y Y is strongly correlated with every different X value for SCN CBN X _vs_SMN Y Y is strongly correlated with every different X value for SMN CBN X _vs_VSN Y Y is strongly correlated with every different X value for VSN CBN X _vs_CON Y X is strongly correlated with every different Y value for CON CBN X _vs_DMN Y X is strongly correlated with every different Y value for DMN CBN X _vs_CBN Y X is strongly correlated with every different Y value for CBN Correlations between target and CBN features are very weak which can be seen at the bottom and right end. 143931 Validation NAE 0. Analyses may examine differences over time i. nii file that is shared in the competition data. To estimate correlation matrices we import connectome utilities from nilearn Initializing ConnectivityMeasure object with kind correlation call transform from RegionExtractor object to extract timeseries signals call fit_transform from ConnectivityMeasure object saving each subject correlation to correlations Mean of all correlations import numpy as np First plot the matrix Then find the center of the regions and plot a connectome First we plot a network of index 4 without region extraction left plot from nilearn import image For this we take the indices of the all regions extracted related to original network given as 4. The gap between training and validation NAE looks very realistic based on the train test discrepancies especially for age. fMRI_train and fMRI_test are directories in which there are 5877 samples. They have been transformed and de identified to help protect subject identity and minimize the risk of unethical usage of the data. Those shifts can be observed due to small sample size of site 2 subjects but they are suspicious. threshold parameter is used for reducing the noise in visualizations. contour to use more options with this method By default no color fillings will be shown using add_contours. The third set of features are the component spatial maps SM. Accessing the data using matlab_file SM_feature shows us each. None of the loading features have a visible relationship with any of the targets. 34 and between age and domain2_var1 0. Now we have functional image in 3D assigned in mean_haxby_img We are now able to use add_edges method inherited in plotting object named as display. mat inside the fMRI_train is read in the cell below. The first set of features are source based morphometry SBM loadings. The strongest correlations are between age and domain1_var1 0. This means every targets normalized absolute error is independent from each other. See help on matplotlib. 3 Visualizing 3D Data on 3D Space 3D spatial maps can also be visualized on 3D space with nilearn package. csv static FNC correlation features for both train and test samples. csv is the file which consists of target features. I try my level best to give all things as simple as possible. An MRI scan is different from a CT scan or an X ray in that it doesn t use radiation to produce images. For example running this by clicking run or pressing Shift Enter will list all files under the input directory It s necessary to reorient the axes since h5py flips axis order import matplotlib. contourf to use more options given that filled should be True Coordinates of seed regions should be specified in first argument and second argument marker_color denotes color of the sphere in this case yellow y and third argument marker_size denotes size of the sphere from nilearn import datasets Import dictionary learning algorithm from decomposition module and call the object and fit the model to the functional datasets Initialize DictLearning object Fit to the data Resting state networks maps in attribute components_img_ Note that this attribute is implemented from version 0. Every cross correlation of VSN have very strong correlations inside the second network groups. Loading Features Site Distributions It is hard to make an accurate analysis on feature distributions for different sites because sample sizes are different for site 1 and 2. This feature may require some preprocessing. I tried to simulate the private leaderboard by Training on 5342 samples which are classified as site 1 site_predicted expected value 1. The same pattern from SMN VSN CON and DMN features can be seen on CBN features as well. 147178domain1_var2 Train NAE 0. score Large sum limits_ f w_ f Big frac sum_ i big y_ f i hat y _ f i big sum_ i hat y _ f i Big The weights are. nii Input data files are available in the. mat format fMRI_test a folder containing 53 3D spatial maps for test samples in. Kolmogorov Smirnov test calculated on site 1 and site 2 feature distribution can be used for feature selection. Site effects are a form of bias. iter_img and visualized one by one with nilearn. There are three types of shifts in the distributions ploted below Mild shift in site 1 2 feature distribution but it can t be seen on train test feature distribution Mean shift close to 0. There are also repeating light orange and light blue diagonal lines. There are 5877 site 1 samples training set and 510 verified site 2 samples. The most extreme outlier in loading features belongs to IC_02. Human brain research is among the most complex areas of study for scientists. However 3D spatial maps have to be drawn on a reference image and the reference image is fMRI_mask. Every cross correlation of SMN have very strong correlations inside the second network groups. A small percentage of values are missing in target features except age. There is only one ADN vs ADN ADN 56 _vs_ADN 21 feature and it doesn t have any significant correlation with anything. However none of the feature shifts are as severe as IC_20 in loading features. Network names and abbreviations are listed below SCN Sub cortical NetworkADN Auditory NetworkSMN Sensorimotor NetworkVSN Visual NetworkCON Cognitive control Network DMN Default mode NetworkCBN Cerebellar Network Those groups might be useful to analyze 1378 features part by part. Different colours are given to the different signal frequency bands to create a beautiful interactive artwork that seems to crackle with energy showing how information is transferred or at least estimated to do so between different regions of the brain. Probabilistic atlasing is a research strategy whose goal is to generate anatomical templates that retain quantitative information on inter subject variations in brain architecture Mazziotta et al. This is the reason of train and test set feature distribution discrepancies. 2 Source based Morphometry Loadings Correlations There are strong correlations between age and some loading features that exceed 0. This sub group has cross correlations with SCN 85 ADN 34 SMN 153 VSN 153 and itself 136. There are 26 features in loading. 150529 Validation NAE 0. FNC features from the same groups must be in the same network in order to have strong correlation. Data is saved in pickle format for faster save and load time. 171517 Even though Ridge regression scores 0. Sometimes a contrast agent or dye can be given through an intravenous IV line to better visualize certain structures or abnormalities. 2 Visualizing 3D Data on 2D Space Those 53 3D spatial maps can be visualized with nilearn package. Some of those visualizations are more detailed and some of them are faster. FNC Features Site Distributions There are 1378 FNC features so they can t be analyzed one by one. 151338 Validation Weighted NAE 0. open_in_browser from nilearn import datasets from nilearn import plotting from nilearn import image img is now an in memory 3D img Load 4D probabilistic atlases from nilearn import datasets Harvard Oxford Atlasf Multi Subject Dictionary Learning Atlas Smith ICA Atlas and Brain Maps 2009 ICBM tissue probability Allen RSN networks Pauli subcortical atlas Visualization from nilearn import plotting An optional colorbar can be set General packages image and mask directories checking missing data Create correlation matrix Select upper triangle of correlation matrix Find index of feature columns with correlation greater than 0. Thus heavily overfitting to the training set age will very likely have a negative impact on your submissions. To extract timeseries signals we call transform from RegionExtractor object onto each subject functional data stored in func_filenames. Parametric statistical models are assumed at each voxel using the general linear model to describe the data variability in terms of experimental and confounding effects with residual variability. SMN X _vs_ADN Y Y is moderately correlated with every different X value for ADN SMN X _vs_SCN Y Y is moderately correlated with every different X value for SCN SMN X _vs_SMN Y Y is moderately correlated with every different X value for SMN Correlations between target and SMN features are very weak which can be seen at the bottom and right end. It s necessary to reorient the axes since h5py flips axis order convert to 3d image convert to 3d image img is now an in memory 3D img convert to 3d image convert to 3d image convert to 3d image convert to 3d image main or target element in problem Giving less importance to FNC features since they are easier to overfit due to high dimensionality. Understand the Problem statment What is NeuroImaging Neuroimaging or brain imaging is the use of various techniques to either directly or indirectly image the structure function or pharmacology of the nervous system. Models used for predicting targets should be robust to outliers. The 53 3D spatial maps that are visualized below belong to a single sample 10001. Inference FNC features from the same group are more likely to be correlated with each other. Their descriptive statistical summary are very similar to each other. There might be a relationship between age and var1 features. 1 MATLAB Files The. The scanner produces a map of the area that is represented as voxels. There are 10 ADN 2 vs SCN 5 features and they have very strong correlations. The entire heatmap of FNC features is rendered below but it is very hard to derive any meaning from it. IC_20 IC_18 IC_11 IC_21 and IC_05 are at the top of feature importance in site classifier model. With much of the research using MRI scans data scientists are well positioned to support future insights. Hypotheses expressed in terms of the model parameters are assessed at each voxel with univariate statistics. A type I error would result in falsely assessing background brain activity as related to the task. Component Spatial Maps The third set of features are the component spatial maps SM. This data is mapped to the source of that electrical activity i. Default mode Network DMN Features Sixth FNC feature sub group is DMN features. Even in the same groups there are lots of weak correlations. Physicians who specialize in the performance and interpretation of neuroimaging in the clinical setting are neuroradiologists. nii as a reference image. A c to me this is one of the best competition on kaggle. httpml using proxy artist from nilearn import datasets haxby dataset to have EPI images and masks print basic information on the dataset 4D data one motor contrast map from NeuroVault Visualizing t map image on EPI template with manual positioning of coordinates using cut_coords given as a list In a Jupyter notebook if view is the output of a cell it will be displayed below the cell Import image processing tool from nilearn import image Compute the voxel_wise mean of functional images across time. Correlations between target and CON features are very weak which can be seen at the bottom and right end. The same pattern from SMN features can be seen on VSN features as well. Glass brain visualization. view_img_on_surf used as the plotting function and it renders the 3D data onto a 3D brain figure. nilearn is very useful to visualize 3D spatial maps because plot_stat_map plots the data from three different angles which makes it easier to see the correlated parts of brain. In this challenge we have to predict age and assessment values from two domains using features derived from brain MRI images as inputs. txt intrinsic connectivity network numbers for each fMRI spatial map matches FNC names. We know that age and other factors can affect its function and structure but more research is needed into what specifically occurs within the brain. They support standard modes like r w a and should be closed when they are no longer in use. 161 on slightly different samples. This explains the light orange and light blue color blocks everywhere except near of diagonal axis. You will go to a hospital or radiology center to take a head MRI. The same things in loading features can be observed in FNC features as well. This is the largest sub group and there are 561 features in it. The anatomically realistic 3D brain will show realtime data from electroencephalographic EEG signals taken from a specially designed EEG cap. It is hard to identify correlations at feature level on this scale but it still gives lots of information. fMRI voxels typically represent a volume of 27 mm3 a cube with 3mm length sides. mat file is a 4D HDF5 dataset with the shape of 53 52 63 53. The axis of data is reoriented in reverse order. Every cross correlation of CBN have very strong correlations inside the second network groups. 125 for KS statistic threshold and selected features that are exceeding the threshold. 154733domain1_var1 Train NAE 0. Those features are named as Network1 X _vs_Network2 Y and there are 7 different networks. com Chaogan Yan DPABI raw master Templates ch2better. 189226domain2_var2 Train NAE 0.

Add as an overlay all the regions of index 4 from nilearn import datasets By default 2nd subject will be fetched print basic information on the dataset Compute the mean EPI we do the mean along the axis 3 which is time Visualize it as an ROI masked_data shape is timepoints voxels. This explains the bright red and blue blocks near the diagonal axis. 146966domain2_var1 Train NAE 0. This is a large sub group compared to previous ones and there are 99 features in it. That s why train test distribution of the feature should be plotted as well in order to measure the shift in distribution. This is a large sub group and there are 202 features in it. Loading features should be used in this classifier along with shifted FNC features. The second set are static functional network connectivity FNC matrices. Those are the 53 3D spatial maps. Before transformation the age in the training set is rounded to nearest year for privacy reasons. For an example the first file 10001. Load Necessary Library for this project Load Data 1. This explains the bright red blocks near the diagonal axis. fMRI_train a folder containing 53 3D spatial maps for train samples in. 1 Targets Distributions Even though some of target features are slightly tailed all of them follow a normal distribution. Train Weighted NAE 0. Plotting an EPIIn Echo Planar Imaging EPI based Magnetic Resonance Imaging MRI inter subject registration typically uses the subject s T1 weighted T1w anatomical image to learn deformations of the subject s brain onto a template. Correlations from different groups doesn t seem to be very strong. To generalize well models should learn features that are not related to or driven by site effects. 2 Validate on 535 samples which slightly look like site 2 site_predicted expected value 1. That is where the data is stored. No shift in both site 1 2 and train test feature distributions. Those features can be trusted. The same pattern from SMN VSN and CON features can be seen on DMN features as well. This sub group has cross correlations with SCN 20 ADN 8 SMN 36 VSN 36 CON 68 DMN 28 and itself 6. A digital probabilistic atlas of the human brain incorporating precise statistical information on positional variability of important functional and anatomic interfaces may rectify many current atlasing problems since it specifically stores information on the population variability. About this notebook. Those features are contained under the directories below fMRI_train a folder containing 53 3D spatial maps for train samples in. PREDICT MISSING VALUE WITH A MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM knn. It yields very few samples for models to use as a validation set. Let understand the Dataset. mat file that contains 53 3D spatial maps. Before the 3D spatial maps are loaded it s necessary to reorient the axis since h5py flips axis order. Auditory Network ADN Features Second FNC feature sub group is ADN features. 2 Ridge regression is used in this simulation and the results are listed below. Because many statistical tests are conducted adjustments have to be made to control for type I errors false positives potentially caused by the comparison of levels of activity over many voxels. 125 is an arbitrary number and distribution difference can be measured with other ways as well but feature selection should definitely be based on site 1 and 2 feature distribution difference. There are 5 target features to predict and submissions are scored using feature weighted normalized absolute errors. Cerebellar Network CBN Features Seventh FNC feature sub group is CBN features. Some of those high positive correlations belong to feature groups which are from the same part of the brain. 5 and floors the values lesser than. It give you a chance to learn some cool new things on kaggle and broad you knowledge in Datascience. The measurement technique depends on the imaging technology e. Checking the correlation between features Visualize the Target Columns Again Model using Rapids for 500x faster kNN on GPUs Install Rapids for 500x faster kNN on GPUs Loading Feature Training and Test Set Distribution Loading Feature vs age Loading Feature vs domain1_var1 Loading Feature vs domain1_var2 Loading Feature vs domain2_var1 Loading Feature vs domain2_var2 Loading reference image Reorienting the axis of 3D spatial map Loading 3D spatial maps wget https github. In this case there is no way to find out site 1 samples in test set perfectly but they can be predicted with a classifier by looking at feature distributions. 5 Draw Plot Decoration Input data files are available in the. The same pattern from SMN and VSN features can be seen on CON features as well. During this test you may need to carry out small tasks such as answering basic questions or tapping your thumb with your fingertips. 1 Source based Morphometry Loadings Distributions All of the loading features follow a normal distribution. Due to the measurement procedures BOLD images usually have a realtively low resolution as you want to squeeze in as many data points along time as possible. It is even hard to identify correlations at block level on this scale but it still gives lots of information. If a number is given it is used to threshold the image values below the threshold in absolute value are plotted as transparent. 5 different plotting functions used in the visualizations below in every row. Another important thing to consider is train_scores. csv age and assessment values for train samples. 129934 Validation NAE 0. Severe shift in site 1 2 feature distribution that it can also be seen on train test feature distribution Mean shift greater than 0. pyplot as plt load dataset print basic information on the dataset 4D data Build the mean image because we have no anatomic data We generate a legend using the trick described on http matplotlib. contour colors are changed to blue b with alpha 0. mat files are using dictionary interface so data inside the file can be accessed with keys and values methods. mat formatThose explanations are written under the Data tab on the competition page but they are not clear. This is also the second smallest sub group of FNC features and there are 11 features in it. IC_20 is the most dangerous feature without any doubt but other loading features should be selected very carefully in main models.

As already written in Introduction Human brain research is among the most complex areas of study for scientists. Basically reducing the functional image from 4D to 3D Visualizing mean image 3D haxby dataset to have anatomical image EPI images and masks localizer dataset to have contrast maps from nilearn import image Compute voxel wise mean functional image across time dimension. Target features in the same domain have same number of missing values and they are missing in same samples. correlations between a task variable and brain activity in a certain area using linear convolution models of how the measured signal is caused by underlying changes in neural activity. csv and train_scores. However the choice of what should be done is largely dependent on the nature of our data and the missing values. 4 but none of the loading features are correlated with other targets. We can plot the first 150 timepoints from two voxels And now plot a few of these import matplotlib. Loading features have decent correlations between themselves that exceed 0. These are the subject level 3D images of 53 spatial networks estimated from GIG ICA of resting state functional MRI fMRI. DMN X _vs_ADN Y X is strongly correlated with every different Y value for ADN DMN X _vs_SCN Y X is strongly correlated with every different Y value for SCN DMN X _vs_SMN Y X is strongly correlated with every different Y value for SMN DMN X _vs_VSN Y X is strongly correlated with every different Y value for VSN DMN X _vs_CON Y X is strongly correlated with every different Y value for CON DMN X _vs_DMN Y X is strongly correlated with every different Y value for DMN Every cross correlation of DMN have weak correlations inside the first network groups. There are 1378 features in fnc. HDF5 files work generally like standard Python file objects. FNC features in the same network don t have strong correlations if they are not in the same group. csv a list of subject IDs whose data was collected with a different scanner than the train samples. Below is a summary highlight of several options we have for handling missing values. Sensorimotor Network SMN Features Third FNC feature sub group is SMN features. 2 Targets Correlations Target features are not correlated with each other too much. 7 sets the transparency of color fillings. Use this to inform your models about site effects. Cognitive control Network CON Features Fifth FNC feature sub group is CON features. Correlations between target and ADN features are very weak which can be seen at the bottom and right end. While there are fewer site 2 subjects than site 1 subjects in the test set the total number of subjects from site 2 will not be revealed until after the end of the competition. 175 corresponding to features age domain1_var1 domain1_var2 domain2_var1 domain2_var2. Static Functional Network Connectivity The second set of features are static functional network connectivity FNC matrices. Plotting a statistical mapStatistical parametric mapping or SPM is a statistical technique for examining differences in brain activity recorded during functional neuroimaging experiments. VSN X _vs_ADN Y Y is moderately correlated with every different X value for ADN VSN X _vs_SCN Y Y is moderately correlated with every different X value for SCN VSN X _vs_SMN Y Y is moderately correlated with every different X value for SMN VSN X _vs_VSN Y Y is moderately correlated with every different X value for VSN Correlations between target and VSN features are very weak which can be seen at the bottom and right end.
