Let us check for any missing values As seen above there are no missing null values in this dataframe but in real scenarios we need work on dataset with a lot of missing values Let us explore the Math Score first How many students passed in Math exam Let us explore the Reading score How many studends passed in reading Let us explore writing score How many students passed writing Iet us check How many students passed in all the subjects Find the percentage of marks Let us assign the grades Grading above 80 A Grade 70 to 80 B Grade 60 to 70 C Grade 50 to 60 D Grade 40 to 50 E Grade below 40 F Grade means Fail we will plot the grades obtained in a order.
