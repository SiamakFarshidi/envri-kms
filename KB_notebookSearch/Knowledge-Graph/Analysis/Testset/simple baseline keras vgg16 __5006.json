For example running this by clicking run or pressing Shift Enter will list all files under the input directory Plotly for the interactive viewer see last section for dirname _ filenames in os. The data is provided in 4 parts train. I ll keep making changes to the kernel as I m trying to improve the model. If the cancer is almost entirely made up of cells with the same score the grade for that area is counted twice to calculated the total Gleason Score. com frlemarchand high res samples into multi input cnn keras. Reshape the images to be of shape 224 224 3 Basic image augmentation like rotation flipping etc. ISUP gradeAccording to current guidelines by the International Society of Urological Pathology ISUP the Gleason scores are summarized into an ISUP grade on a scale from 1 to 5 according to the following rule Gleason score 6 ISUP grade 1 Gleason score 7 3 4 ISUP grade 2 Gleason score 7 4 3 ISUP grade 3 Gleason score 8 ISUP grade 4 Gleason score 9 10 ISUP grade 5. An example as provided on the official page of the competition can make us understand better. The classes are imbalanced more severe cases are underrepresented. Not all training images have label masks and there may be false positives or false negatives in the label masks for a variety of reasons. some of these images will be used for testing. These tissue samples are examined by a pathologist and scored according to the Gleason grading system. In this challenge we have to develop models for detecting PCa on images of prostate tissue samples. com c prostate cancer grade assessment overview additional resources. walk kaggle input for filename in filenames print os. Diagnosis of PCa is based on the grading of prostate tissue biopsies. The mask values also depend on the data provider. org about prostate conditions prostate cancer newly diagnosed gleason score This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed It is defined by the kaggle python docker image https github. The appearance of the glands forms the basis of the Gleason grading system. These masks are provided to assist with the development of strategies for selecting the most useful subsamples of the images. These images are pretty big in size for training I ll be using the resized 512x512 dataset uploaded by xhlulu.

Let s take a look at one of the biopsy. png This is how Gleason score is decided from 3 5 5 being the most severe. About the competitionWith more than 1 million new diagnoses reported every year prostate cancer PCa is the second most common cancer among males worldwide that results in more than 350 000 deaths annually. If you like the kernel Don t forget to upvote. read_csv Input data files are available in the. train_images A folder containing biopsy images in a large multilevel. csv That contains the image_id name of either of the two data provider gleason and ISUP grade. The training set consists of around 11 000 whole slide WSI images of digitized H E stained biopsies a standard way of staining the originally transparent tissue to produce some contrast originating from Radboud University Medical Center and Karolinska Institute the data_provider field in train test corresponds to this. The samples are made up of glandular tissue and connective tissue. The key to decreasing mortality is developing more precise diagnostics. For instance if the Gleason Score is written as 3 4 7 it means most of the tumor is grade 3 and the next largest section of the tumor is grade 4 together they make up the total Gleason Score. Let s take a look at the architecture. Gleason Score Since prostate tumors are often made up of cancerous cells that have different grades two grades are assigned for each patient. The glands are hollow structures which can be seen as white holes or branched cavities in the WSI. png The most common blue outline Gleason pattern 3 and second most common red outline Gleason pattern 4 cancer growth patterns present in the biopsy dictate the Gleason score 3 4 for this biopsy which in turn is converted into an ISUP grade 2 for this biopsy following guidelines of the International Society of Urological Pathology. Let s start preparing the images for training. Biopsies not containing cancer are represented by an ISUP grade of 0 in this challenge. So the basic preprocessing I ve done is Normalizing the images. We are asked to predict ISUP grade scale 0 5 for each prostate biopsy image which is in turn derived from the gleason score three categories 3 4 5. Before diving deeper into the competition let s try to understand these first. A primary grade is given to describe the cells that make up the largest area of the tumor and a secondary grade is given to describe the cells of the next largest area. join dirname filename Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.
