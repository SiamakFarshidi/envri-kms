Layer normalization 1. Create a multi head attention layer. To improve the model quality without pre training you can try to train the model for more epochs use a larger number of Transformer layers resize the input images change the patch size or increase the projection dimensions. References Keras Docs https keras. Model Results SummaryNote that the state of the art results reported in the paper are achieved by pre training the ViT model using the JFT 300M dataset then fine tuning it on the target dataset. In addition it adds a learnable position embedding to the projected vector. Note that the GlobalAveragePooling1D layer could also be used instead to aggregate the outputs of the Transformer block especially when the number of patches and the projection dimensions are large. Skip connection 2. Create a batch_size projection_dim tensor. Create multiple layers of the Transformer block. Multilayer Perceptron MLP 2. Classify outputs. Build the ViT modelThe ViT model consists of multiple Transformer blocks which use the MultiHeadAttention layer as a self attention mechanism applied to the sequence of patches. Skip connection 1. Create the model. png attachment image. io api Research Paper https arxiv. In practice it s recommended to fine tune a ViT model that was pre trained using a large high resolution dataset. Patch Encoding LayerThe PatchEncoder layer will linearly transform a patch by projecting it into a vector of size projection_dim. The Transformer blocks produce a batch_size num_patches projection_dim tensor which is processed via an classifier head with softmax to produce the final class probabilities output. Besides as mentioned in the paper the quality of the model is affected not only by architecture choices but also by parameters such as the learning rate schedule optimizer weight decay etc. Patch Creation Layer Sample Image Patches Visualization 3.
