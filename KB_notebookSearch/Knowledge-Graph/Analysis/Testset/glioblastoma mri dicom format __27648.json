Radiomic features such as size shape intensity histogram and texture features were extracted from the tumor regions on the CE T1WIs and T2WIs. In the independent validation the mean AUC value for all prediction models was 0. For more than 20 years magnetic resonance imaging MRI has been used in the clinical diagnosis of gliomas to serve as a guide for clinical treatment. The survival time of patients with GBM is significantly shorter than that of patients with lower grade gliomas. Metastases had significantly more extensive peritumoral T2 high signal intensity than glioblastomas had. This study aims to investigate the role of additional resection of FLAIR detected abnormalities and its influence on clinical outcomes of patients with GBM. The authors assessed the ability of various morphological parameters using conventional MRI and diffusion based techniques to distinguish between glioblastomas and solitary metastases in tumoral and peritumoral regions. Data analysis and statistics The statistical analysis was done using GraphPad Prism 7 software and Rstudio. GBM is classified by the World Health Organization as a grade IV glioma. A low level of MGMT gene expression was correlated with positive MGMT promoter methylation p 0. MRI imaging is a proxy measurement of tumors as itprimarily resolves contrast T1Gd and interstitial fluid accumulation T2 FLAIR which are measures ofleaky vasculature and edema respectively. The MGMT status has become a parameter for stratification of patients with glioma within clinical trials.
