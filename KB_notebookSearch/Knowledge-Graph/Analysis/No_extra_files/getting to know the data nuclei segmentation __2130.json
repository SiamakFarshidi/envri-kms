Let s see the values of this 4th item. Your folder names look like this Each directory contains the following directories And what s inside of them Here s an example Okay so what do they look like So um. Hm four Sanity check RGBA I suppose. all masks are saved separately Can we view them aggregated Apparently scikitlearn has a useful image processing collection of algorithms skimage you ll find it loaded in the beginning How many masks nuclei per image Okay all directories contain at least one mask so no need to worry about that. Within this folder are two subfolders images contains the image file. You can see this by listing the archive Showing the first 5 names here. Navigate with __next__ method. linear algebra data processing CSV file I O e. Kaggle says ZIP archive files will be uncompressed and their contents available at the root folder when this dataset is used in Kernels. Look at that nasty little rascal at 198 What about image sizes So there are images of substantially different sizes though most of them are smallAnd all of them have 4 levels. Files belonging to an image are contained in a folder with this ImageId. DataThis dataset contains a large number of segmented nuclei images. read_csv Input data files are available in the. Each mask contains one nucleus. This folder is only included in the training set. But what you wanna do is walking the archive this does not return a value it s a generator object. The dataset is designed to challenge an algorithm s ability to generalize across these variations. Each image is represented by an associated ImageId. masks contains the segmented masks of each nucleus. Okay apparently there is no other value of this fourth parameter than 255 so we should not take it into consideration when training a model as it contains no useful info. The images were acquired under a variety of conditions and vary in the cell type magnification and imaging modality brightfield vs. You ll notice the images and masks are in a zip archive. For example running this by clicking run or pressing Shift Enter will list the files in the input directory Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output. Masks are not allowed to overlap no pixel belongs to two masks. so number of masks dimension1 dimension2 Start with a matrix of size the same as the image or masks And there you have it Just to compare again with the original image Let me adapt the above code for merging masks into a function Start with a matrix of size the same as the image or masks And there you have it Just to compare again with the original image.
