ASL possesses a set of 26 signs known as the American manual alphabet which can be used to spell out words from the English language. Step 1 Import Modules Step 2 Load Data Step 3 Vizualize Data The min max pixel values are already scaled between 0 and 13 images from category A 3 images from category B 20 images from category A 20 images from category B Step 4 Define Helper Functions Step 5 Evaluate Classification Models Transfer learning w VGG16 Convolutional NetworkGreat we were able to interpret the signs with an accuracy rate of approximately 92. Interpret Sign Language with Deep Learning Which sign represents which letter in the alphabet Looks like a task for Deep Learning https www. That is much better than random chance given that there were 26 different signs.
