Let s divide it into this zone. The starting point value is 100 and other than main modeThere are only 23 graphs other than the main mode where u_in starts with 100 and they have the same graph shape. I was multiplying by time_step which means real time in this competition instead of time_delta. 5 seconds it starts up with the same shape and the final value is 4.

This EDA specializes in u_in Note I made a mistake in calculating the area of u_in and time_delta. The Main mode u_in ends 4. If you expand it there is only one data for 5 or more. It seems that there are many graphs where 1. Further close up around 5. R_C is also only 50_10. 0 is the final value of u_in main mode. 5 is 0 and it starts from 1.

This notebook is a continuation of EDA about time_step and u_out https www. The Main modeThere are 70018 main modes. The R_C distribution clearly has a decrease of 50_10 compared to the overall distribution. The R_C distribution is also biased. u_in has a main mode that accounts for 70018 75450 92. The u_in graph seems to have a vibration shape and a hilly shape. 0 only R_C is only 50_10. The u_in graph looks like a vibrating shape in much the same way. com marutama eda about lstm feature importance And finetune of Tensorflow Bi LSTM EDA about https www.

If you find it useful please upvote it as well. Let s increase bins and expand. 0 there are three peaks in the final u_in value in main mode which is between 4. com marutama finetune of tensorflow bi lstm eda about is for Modeling.

Other than the Main mode 0. Use a set operation to separate the other modes. Other than the Main mode u_in ends 0. Is the vibration shape of the u_in graph increasing again Other than the Main mode 0. All R_Cs other than the main mode are 50_10. Graphs with u_in starting at 0 excluding the main mode are unique and have a distinctly different shape from other graphs. For the R_C distribution part I referred to Ventilator Pressure simple EDA https www. Other than the Main mode u_in ends 5. It s 70018 75450 92. Let s call this graph the main mode of u_in. The u_in graph seems to have more hill shapes than vibration shapes. The importance of the features introduced in the EDA about series below EDA about LSTM Feature Importance https www.
