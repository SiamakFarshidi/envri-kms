Get your vocabulary as close to the embeddings as possible I will focus in this notebook how to achieve that. Nice We were able to increase our embeddings ratio from 24 to 57 by just handling punctiation. Ok lets check on thos oov words. We start with a neat little trick that enables us to see a progressbar when applying functions to a pandas DataframeLets load our dataI will use the following function to track our training vocabulary which goes through all our text and counts the occurance of the contained words. Lets check the oov words again Looks good. 15 becomes while 123 becomes or 15. We see that although we improved on the amount of embeddings found for all our text from 89 to 99. I start with two golden rules 1. hmm why is in there Simply because as a reprocessing all numbers bigger tha 9 have been replaced by hashs. Thank you for reading and happy kaggling. TFIDF such as removing stopwords stemming etc. In this kernel I want to illustrate how I do come up with meaningful preprocessing when building deep learning NLP models. Hmm seems like numbers also are a problem. If the token has an embedding keep it if it doesn t we don t need it anymore. Additionally we will simply remove the words a to and and of since those have obviously been downsampled when training the GoogleNews Embeddings. Lets check the top 10 embeddings to get a clue. On first place there is to. Lets check the oov wordsOk now we take care of common misspellings when using american british vocab and replacing a few modern words with social media for this task I use a multi regex script I found some time ago on stack overflow. For this we can easily have a look at the top oov words. It will output a list of out of vocabulary oov words that we can use to improve our preprocessingOuch only 24 of our vocabulary will have embeddings making 21 of our data more or less useless. Why Simply because to was removed when the GoogleNews Embeddings were trained. Note that now we can use progess_apply to see progress barNext we import the embeddings we want to use in our model later. So we basically define a function that splits off and removes other punctuation. Now as much as with handling the puntuation but every bit helps. No obvious oov words there we could quickly fix. So lets populate the vocabulary and display the first 5 elements and their count. The reason is simple You loose valuable information which would help your NN to figure things out. We will fix this later for now we take care about the splitting of punctuation as this also seems to be a Problem. For illustration I use GoogleNews here. While is in the Google News Embeddings is not. Don t use standard preprocessing steps like stemming or stopword removal when you have pre trained embeddings Some of you might used standard preprocessing steps when doing word count based feature extraction e. Next I define a function that checks the intersection between our vocabulary and the embeddings. But what do we do with the punctuation then Do we want to delete or consider as a token I would say It depends. So lets mimic this preprocessing step to further improve our embeddings coverageNice Another 3 increase. For an example I take the GoogleNews pretrained embeddings there is no deeper reason for this choice. So lets have a look and start improving.
