We are considering the markings made under radboud category as its straight forward to derive the Gleason score based on the markings which range from 0 to 5. Pre Processing and Analysis Version 1 Create Patches from Images Version 2 Create Patches from Masks Version 3 Check if the marking distribution aligns with the Gleason Score given Steps to create sliding window images slices with PytorchSliding window is the standard approach used to process WSI so that the input files can be accomodated in the GPU. png attachment image. Usual Imports Check input file Load input file and check dimensions Display the file Convert to torch and CHW format Create patches of size 512x512 Load mask file Only the third channel has the markings Convert to torch and CHW format Show a Random Patch. png Get the percentage Distribution from Masks and cross check with Gleason ScoreThe value 0 in the mask corresponds to background and unknown areas let us avoid those and check the percentage distribution of other labels and see if it matches with the Gleason Score. There is are no markings of cancerous epithelium Gleason 3 but score is given as 3 3 in first case. In the second cancerous epithelium Gleason 3 is only 0.
