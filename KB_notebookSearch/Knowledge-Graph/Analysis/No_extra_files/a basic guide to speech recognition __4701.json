The latter is harder to recognize. For example human speech contains high bandwidth with full frequency range while a telephone speech consists of low bandwidth with limited frequency range. Note that a continuous speech is harder to recognize. Type of noise Noise is another factor to consider while developing an ASR. The final output of the HMM is a sequence of these vectors. Difficulties in developing a speech recognizer Size of the vocabulary Larger the size of vocabulary the harder it is to perform speech recognition. The dimension of this ector is usually small sometimes as low as 10 although more accurate systems may have dimension 32 or more. Channel Charateristics Channel quality is also an important dimension. This approach works on the assumption that a speech signal when viewed on a short enough timescale say ten milliseconds can be reasonably approximated as a stationary process that is a process in which statistical properties do not change over time. Speaker dependency Speech can be speaker dependent speaker adaptive or speaker independent. jpg attachment Automatic_Speech_Recognition_ASR. How does speech recognition work Almost all speech recognition systems rely on hidden Markov Model HMM. This prevents the recognizer from wasting time analyzing unnecessary parts of the signal. It is harder in the latter. A special algorithm is then applied to determine the most likely word or words that produce the given sequence of phonemes. This calculation requires training since the sound of a phoneme varies from speaker to speaker and even varies from one utterance to another by the same speaker. e the process in which statistical properties do not change over time. Speech recognition translates spoken languages into text. The power spectrum of each fragement is essentially a plot of the signal s power as a function of frequency is mapped to a vector of real numbers known as cepstral coefficients. In a typical HMM the speech signal is divided into 10 milliseconds fragments. Also the distance between mouth and micro phone can vary. Visualizing audio files Characterizing the audio signalConverting the time domain signal into frequency domain. The basic goal of speech processing is to provide an interaction between a human and a machine. A mathematical tool like fourier transformation can be used for this. In many modern speech recognition systems neural networks are used to simplify the speech signal using techniques for feature transformation and dimensionality reduction before HMM recognition. To decode the speech into text groups of vectors are matched to one or more phonemes a fundamental unit of speech. 2 Second natural language processing to allow the machine to understand what we speak and3 Third speech synthesis to allow the machine to speak. This is important because it gives a lot of information about the signal. Automatic_Speech_Recognition_ASR. Voice activity detectors VADs are also used to reduce an audio signal to only the portions that are likely to contain speech. One can imagine that this whole process may be computationally expensive. Microphone characteristics he quality of microphone may be good average or below average. is the ability of a computer software to identify words and phrases in spoken language and convert them to human readable text. Installing libraries Recognizer class Loading an audio file using google web speech API. Most modern speech recognition systems rely on what is known as a Hidden Markov Model HMM. Speaking mode Ease of developing an ASR also depends on the speaking mode that is whether the speech is in isolated word mode or connected word mode or in a continuous speech mode. Speaking style A read speech may be in a formal style or spontaneous and conversational with casual style. This approach works on the assumption that a speech signal when viewed on a short enough timescale for example 10 milliseconds can be reasonably approximated as a stationary process i. Once digitized several models can be used to transcribe the audio to text. Signal to noise ratio may be in various ranges depending on the acoustic environment that observes less versus more background noise. If the signal to noise ratio is greater than 30dB it is considered as high range. Speech must be converted from physical sound to an electrical signal with a microphone and then to digital data with an analog to digital converter. jpg Speech processing system mainly has 3 tasks 1 First speech recognition that allows the machine to catch the words phrases and sentences we speak.
