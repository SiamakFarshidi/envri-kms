We ll load both for the CycleGAN. Upsample does the opposite of downsample and increases the dimensions of the of the image. Build the generatorThis generator samples from noise reshapes it and upsamples the entire thing. Please head over and upvote https www. CycleGANs were introduced for unpaired Image to Image Translation https junyanz. How to Paint with Generative Adversarial Networks This is part 1 see part 2 here https www. For the first GAN we only need the Monets as training data. com jesperdramsch how to paint with more gans ls cyclegan aug out here where we use the improvements from this notebook Create submission files resizing to 286 x 286 x 3 randomly cropping to 256 x 256 x 3 random mirroring extract 1 batch from the dataset bs 256 256 3 Upsampling bs 128 128 64 bs 64 64 128 bs 32 32 256 bs 34 34 256 bs 31 31 512 bs 33 33 512 bs 30 30 1 generates Monet esque paintings differentiates real Monet paintings and generated Monet paintings Sample random points in the latent space labels_gen tf. The problem This is now two GANs to train that perforn the forward and backward transformation to create the new style from nothing. Build the discriminatorThe discriminator takes in the input image and classifies it as real or fake generated. reduce_mean predictions_real labels_real 2 2. ch event 595059 contributions 2497383 attachments 1431666 2199445 gan_presentation_IML. Some important stuff you may want to check out if you re interested are keywords like Wasserstein GANs Gradient Penalization Attention and in this context Style Transfer namely face2face. GAN from Dramsch PhD thesis. The learning process is collaborative. Because TPUs are pretty awesome. They re a really cool concept and even used in scientific simulation at CERN https indico. Maybe you ll even find some in the comments. com jesperdramsch intro to deep fakes videos and metadata eda if you re interested to learn how GANs are used to alter images videos and sounds. Did I mention they re quite versatile This also builds on the Baseline Tutorial. The stride is the length of the step the filter takes. Instead of outputing a single node the discriminator outputs a smaller 2D image with higher pixel values indicating a real classification and lower values indicating a fake classification. GANs are technically two networks that work against each other illustrated below. Which of course it does because it s taken directly from the tutorial. org wiki Nash_equilibrium is reached which means neither can learn new tricks and get better. Additionally we need to scale the images to a 1 1 scale. real_label Add random noise to the labels important trick Train the generator Train the discriminator Calculate loss LSGan d_loss tf. Build the DCGAN Network Upsample and DownsampleThe downsample as the name suggests reduces the 2D dimensions the width and height of the image by the stride. In this tutorial we ll go in depth into Creating images from noise Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks DCGANs Better Loss Functions Data Augmentations Training Tensorflow GANs on TPUs This copies in part from my Intro to Deepfakes https www. Things to noteWe re using a few tricks here including soft labeling differing learning rates augmentation a better loss function etc. Finally we can compare apples to oranges. reduce_mean predictions_real tf. They re pretty useful generally and have been applied in many domains and style transfer applications. reduce_mean predictions_gen labels_real 2 2 Train the generator Train the discriminator Calculate loss LSGan g_loss tf. First load in the filenames of the TFRecords. This has become a very popular area of research warranting a GAN Zoo https github. jpg Check that notebook https www. png Load in the dataWe want to keep our photo dataset and our Monet dataset separate. All the images for the competition are already sized to 256 x 256. You can probably guess that they can be tricky to train due to so many moving parts. The artist generator draws its inspiration from a noise sample and creates a rendering of the data you are trying to generate with said GAN. fill batch_size 1 self. We can generate them from scratch using one GAN where the GAN basically imagines a Monet from scratch. What about Second GANs Alternatively because us machine learning scientists had a bit too much GPUs running idle people came up with the idea of cycle consistent GANs. io CycleGAN for when you don t have Monet available to paint your favorite subject. Because we are building a generative model we don t need the labels or the image id so we ll only return the image from the TFRecord. Import the following packages and change the accelerator to TPU. The private investigator discriminator randomly gets assigned real and fake data to investigate. Conv2DTranspose does basically the opposite of a Conv2D layer. You can see I put down a bit of augmentation using random_jitter and flip to increase our data set because we simply don t have enough data forThen load the data and display the first images to see if it all worked out. So this is where we compile and train the model. As these images are RGB images set the channel to 3. Notice that I changed the loss function from the Binary Crossentropy used in the CycleGAN to a Least Squares approach taken from the RaLSGAN for dogs https www. io CycleGAN images objects. Define the Least Squares Loss Throw it on the TPU And build a GAN with the help of the keras documentation https keras. As the instance normalization is not standard in the TensorFlow API we ll use the layer from TensorFlow Add ons. In mathematical terms they are learning until a Nash equilibrium https en. We ll be using an instance normalization instead of batch normalization. reduce_mean predictions_gen tf. The DCGAN would not converge on BCE whatsoever and the LSGAN works surprisingly well for the amount of data we have. Since the stride is 2 the filter is applied to every other pixel hence reducing the weight and height by 2. The generator gets better at fooling the discriminator and the discriminator gets better at figuring out which data is real and which isn t. com speedwagon ralsgan dogs. png Figure describing Generative Adversarial Networks from my PhD thesis https dramsch. reduce_mean predictions_real labels_real 2 tf.
