Coordinates are in mm and momentum in MeV cThe two functions defined above allow for a bit more detailed view of the detector plot_volume allows you to select the volume id and you can displays two views transverse yx and longitudinal yz With plot_volume_and_layer you can include the layer_id in your choice. Or this could be an artifact of the hit coordinate algorithm. This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed It is defined by the kaggle python docker image https github. From this first look at the data it is clear that even though the hits appear to be listed by volume_id and layer_id all memory of the tracks has been removed from the data set. The display is also possible in two views. As stated by the organizers. For example running this by clicking run or pressing Shift Enter will list the files in the input directory Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output. This figure is a bit confusing it implies that the disc detectors have four elements in each layer. The layers of all volumes are labelled from the inside out volume 9 has its first layer 2 at z 600 mm its last layer 14 at z 1500 mm Similar labelling is used for the barrel detectors.
