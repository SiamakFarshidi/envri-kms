To do so We compute first the minimum of installment payments in the previous applications table. Thanks to him for his awesome notebook and introduction to Featuretools https www. Fine tune and show the plot. com kaggle media competitions home credit home_credit. We fill the missing values with their average. Home Credit Default Risk Random Forest K Fold Cross ValidationThis notebook shows a simple random forest approach to the Home Credit Default Risk problem. Plot the mean ROC. Finally let s add all the base features from the main loan table which don t need aggregation. Random Forest model K Fold cross validation Example sample of 3 loans Min payment for all previous loans Example SK_ID_CURR 365597 Sum and mean of minimum payments across all previous loans Example SK_ID_CURR 365597 Example SK_ID_CURR 365597 Initialize useful lists the plot axes. Then we merge the aggregates of all minimum installment payments across all previous loans. png Read data Features selectionThe feature selection has been done using the most important features resulting of Will Koehrsen automated features generation https www. com willkoehrsen applied automated feature engineering basics notebook. com static papers DSAA_DSM_2015. Next let s generate the features coming from the installments data. Plot the standard deviation around the mean ROC. The rational is to catch the loans where one payment has been missed or was very low. Home Credit loans data model https storage. First let s aggregate the features coming from the credit bureau file in the main loans table. Loans data modelIt s good to keep in mind Home Credit loans data model to know how to join the different tables. Plot ROC for each K Fold compute AUC scores. Plot the luck line.
