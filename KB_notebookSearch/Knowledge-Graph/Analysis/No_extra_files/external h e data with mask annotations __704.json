There are 29 Images are annotated by the following ids Let us load one image and its masks Now we can read the masks for the specific image. To make sure that masks are disconnected we can add them all into a single mask image using np. linear algebra data processing CSV file I O e. In the example below we zoom into a 200x200 pixel window. We have stored them as png files. For everybody s convenient I converted the annotated nuclei from https nucleisegmentationbenchmark.
