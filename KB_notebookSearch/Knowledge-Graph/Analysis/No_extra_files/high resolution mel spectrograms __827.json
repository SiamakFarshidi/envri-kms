Here we combine FFTs of varying window length to tackle this. With single FFTs short windows have good time resolution but lack frequency breadth no lower frequencies whereas long windows have good frequency breadth but lack time precision windows contain many wavelengths at higher frequencies. png or just use 0 or SR 2 batch_framed_signal has shape batch_size x n_windows x fft_l1 decrease weights for samples w more than wvls_per_window_hinge wvls_per_window_hinge method could be improved maybe weight pmf of poisson. Uses tensorflows eager mode which I couldn t get to work in a kaggle kernel Tensorboard https i. This representation should be more invariant to distortions of both frequency and time due to the mel frequency averaging and time window averaging respectively. This produces a time x log frequency matrix of log powers.
