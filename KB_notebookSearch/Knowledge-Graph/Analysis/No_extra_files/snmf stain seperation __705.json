Remove white pixel from stain color map. In my experience it did not improve the score much. htmlIt only works for RGB images with pixel intensity between 0 255. fr doc python html doc_spams003. Please note that to use the this code you have to install SPAMS python package from http spams devel. Still I hope you can make use of it. Otherwise change beer_lambert_transform function to use approperiate value. I used it to seperate stains into different channels and train my network based these new images.
