Automated Deep Feature SynthesisIn addition to manually specifying aggregation and transformation feature primitives we can let feature tools automatically generate many new features. We can also see that we overrode the type for the repaid feature changing if from numeric to categorical. I think the authors were trying to ride the way of deep neural network hype when they named the method To read more about deep feature synthesis check out the documentation https docs. Later we see these are known in feature tools as transformation feature primitives because they act on column in a single table. We will discuss the features themselves more in a little bit but for now let s define the relationships. An example would be extracting the day from dates or finding the difference between two columns in one table. The concept of Deep Feature Synthesis is to use basic building blocks known as feature primitives like the transformations and aggregations done above that can be stacked on top of each other to form new features. Even a human with considerable domain knowledge will be limited by their imagination when making new features not to mention time. Manual Feature Engineering ExamplesLet s show a few examples of features we might make by hand. All three entities have been successfully added to the EntitySet. We now have our entities in an entityset along with the relationships between them. Already we can see how useful feature tools is it performed the same operations we did manually but also many more in addition. Next StepsWhile automatic feature engineering solves one problem it provides us with another problem too many features Although it s difficult to say which features will be important to a given machine learning task ahead of time it s likely that not all of the features made by feature tools add value. The first part of Feature Tools to understand is an entity https docs. Defining which features are useful is an important problem where a data scientist can still add considerable value to the feature engineering task. This is just a large data structure composed of many individual entities and the relationships between them. html a at a very high level is an operation applied to data to create a feature. You can read the original paper here http www. Feature engineering allows us to combine information across many tables into a single dataframe that we can then use for machine learning model training. In the following example we are using the EntitySet we already created the target entity is the clients dataframe because we want to make new features about each client and then we specify a few aggregation and transformation primitives. Feature tools correctly inferred each of the datatypes when we made this entity. We can view the list of primitives If feature tools does not have enough primitives for us we can also make our own. The depth of a deep feature is equal to the number of stacked primitives. In the terms of feature tools this would be considered an aggregation feature primitive because we using multiple tables in a one to many relationship to calculate aggregation figures don t worry this will be explained shortly. As well scroll through the features we see a number of features with a depth of 2. dfs function which stands for deep feature synthesis. edu pedrod papers cacm12. Examining the names of the features in the dataframe brings us to the final piece of the puzzle deep features. The second relationship is between the loans and payments. First let s cover feature primitives. These relationships are what allow us to group together datapoints using aggregation primitives and then create new features. So a feature that relies on a single aggregation would be a deep feature with a depth of 1 a feature that stacks two primitives would have a depth of 2 and so on. This feature represents the average payment amount for the last most recent loan for each client. org wiki Curse_of_dimensionality Machine_learning and is addressed through the process of feature reduction and selection http scikit learn. In the clients dataframe we can take the month of the joined column and the natural log of the income column. In this notebook we will walk through an implementation of using Feature Tools https www. When we create an entity in feature tools we have to identify which column of the dataframe is the index. This is a powerful method which allows us to overcome the human limits of time and imagination to create many new features from multiple tables of data. Feature tools will automatically infer the variable types numeric categorical datetime of the columns in our data but we can also pass in specific datatypes to override this behavior. The relationship has now been stored in the entity set. This process likely will not remove the human contribution to feature engineering completely because a human can still use domain knowledge and machine learning expertise to select the most important features or build new features from those suggested by automated deep feature synthesis. This is simply a table or in pandas a DataFrame. The index for this dataframe is instead loan_id. Again this is a parent to child relationship because for each client_id in the parent client dataframe there may be multiple entries of the same client_id in the child loans dataframe. We can access any of the entities using Python dictionary syntax. These two entities are related by the loan_id variable. The idea itself is lot simpler than the name deep feature synthesis implies. The depth of a feature is simply the number of primitives required to make a feature. However when I have used feature tools I ve never gone beyond a depth of 2 After this point the features become very convoluted to understand. We will keep this relatively simple to avoid doing too much work First we will focus on a single dataframe before combining them together. The client dataframe is therefore the parent of the loans dataframe because while there is only one row for each client in the client dataframe each client may have several previous loans covering multiple rows in the loans dataframe. In the code below we create the three entities and add them to the EntitySet. Although there are now many efforts working to enable automated model selection and hyperparameter tuning there has been a lack of automating work on the feature engineering aspect of the pipeline. For example let s calculate the average minimum and maximum amount of previous loans for each client. com an open source Python library for automatically creating features with relational data where the data is in structured tables. com the company behind the open source library. I d encourage anyone interested to experiment with increasing the depth maybe for a real problem and see if there is value to going deeper. __Transformation__ an operation applied to one or more columns in a single table. We can now start to making new features from all of the tables using stacks of feature primitives to form deep features. org a83b ddb34618cc68f1014ca12eef7f537825d104. For the clients dataframe this is the client_id because each id only appears once in the clients data. Using primitives is surprisingly easy using the ft. In our example the client and loans dataframes are linked together by the client_id column. Deep feature synthesis has created 90 new features out of the existing data While we could have created all of these manually I am glad to not have to write all that code by hand. RelationshipsAfter defining the entities tables in an EntitySet we now need to tell feature tools how they are related with a relationship https docs. We do this by making the same ft. This is done using an integer with the variables as keys and the feature types as values. Also read about how feature tools is used in the real world by Feature Labs https www. If the data does not have a unique index we can tell feature tools to make an index for the entity by passing in make_index True and specifying a name for the index. These represent very simple calculations that can be stacked on top of each other to create complex features. pdf and although it s quite readable it s not necessary to understand the details to do automated feature engineering. html deep feature synthesis. com automated_feature_engineering primitives. When running on large datasets this process can take quite a while but for our example data it will be relatively quick. dfs function call but without passing in any primitives. The primary benefit of feature tools is that it creates features without any subjective human biases. For example the LAST loans. To do so we would have to group payments by the loan_id merge it with the loans group the resulting dataframe by the client_id and then merge it into the clients dataframe. Although I love pandas there is only so much manual data manipulation I m willing to stand Feature ToolsNow that we know what we are trying to avoid tedious manual feature engineering let s figure out how to automate this process. This is the variable that links two entities together. groupby method followed by a suitable aggregation function followed by df. This process is meant to not replace the data scientist but to make her job easier and allowing her to supplement domain knowledge with an automated workflow. html adding entities. In the loans dataframe client_id is not an index because each id might appear more than once. After creating a relationship we add it to the EntitySet. As an example we can group all of the previous loans associated with one client and find the average loan amount. To incorporate information about the other tables we use the df. Feature primitives fall into two categories __Aggregation__ function that groups together child datapoints for each parent and then calculates a statistic such as mean min max or standard deviation. An example is calculating the maximum loan amount for each client. In this function we specify the entityset to use the target_entity which is the dataframe we want to make the features for where the features end up the agg_primitives which are the aggregation feature primitives and the trans_primitives which are the transformation primitives to apply. First let s load in the data and look at the problem we are working with. com loading_data using_entitysets. Finally the next step after creating all of these features is figuring out which ones are important. Likewise the loans dataframe is the parent of the payments dataframe because each loan will have multiple payments. com automated_feature_engineering afe. We just set the max_depth parameter and feature tools will automatically try many all combinations of feature primitives to the ordered depth. Feature tools has the ability to do this for us creating many new candidate features with minimal effort. DatasetTo show the basic idea of feature tools we will use an example dataset consisting of three tables clients information about clients at a credit union loans previous loans taken out by the clients payments payments made missed on the previous loansThe general problem of feature engineering is taking disparate data often distributed across multiple tables and combining it into a single table that can be used for training a machine learning model. This problem is known as the curse of dimensionality https en. This would allow us to include information about previous payments for each client. Feature reduction will have to be another topic for another day ConclusionsIn this notebook we saw how to apply automated feature engineering to an example dataset. However manual feature engineering is a tedious task and is limited by both human imagination there are only so many features we can think to create and by time creating new features is time intensive. com static papers DSAA_DSM_2015. Automated feature engineering is not limited by these factors instead it s limited by computation time and provides a good starting point for feature creation. Introduction Automated Feature EngineeringIn this notebook we will look at an exciting development in data science automated feature engineering. Feature tools operates on an idea known as Deep Feature Synthesis https docs. We corral multiple entities into a single object called an EntitySet https docs. pdf leaving a model unable to learn how to map the features to the target. EntitySetCreating a new EntitySet is pretty simple Entities An entity is simply a table which is represented in Pandas as a dataframe. If the data also has a uniquely identifying time index we can pass that in as the time_index parameter. The most intuitive way to think of relationships is with the parent to child analogy a parent to child relationship is one to many because for each parent there can be multiple children. Deep Feature SynthesisWhile feature primitives are useful by themselves the main benefit of using feature tools arises when we stack primitives to get deep features. While the exact tools will change the idea of automatically creating new features out of existing data will grow in importance. We can create features of arbitrary depth by stacking more primitives. html which means removing low value features https machinelearningmastery. We could go further and include information about payments in the clients dataframe. As an example even though the repaid column in the loans dataframe is represented as an integer we can tell feature tools that this is a categorical feature since it can only take on two discrete values. loan_amount feature has a depth of 1 because it is made by applying a single aggregation primitive. html defining custom primitives To get an idea of what a feature primitive actually does let s try out a few on our data. For this call we only need to specify the entityset the target_entity which will again be clients and the max_depth. Let s take a look at feature primitives in feature tools. For instance the MEAN loans. Feature PrimitivesA feature primitive https docs. The syntax is relatively straightforward with a few notes for the payments dataframe we need to make an index for the loans dataframe we specify that repaid is a categorical variable and for the payments dataframe we specify that missed is a categorical feature. payment_amount has depth 2 because it is made by stacking two feature primitives first an aggregation and then a transformation. html or the original paper by Max Kanter et al http www. Staying up to date on methods such as automated feature engineering is crucial in the rapidly changing field of data science. Now go out there and find a problem on which to apply feature tools For more information check out the documentation for feature tools https docs. com blog predicting credit card fraud. This feature represents the average size of a client s previous loans. We codify relationships in the language of feature tools by specifying the parent variable and then the child variable. Feature tools is built on the idea of deep feature synthesis which means stacking multiple simple feature primitives __aggregations and transformations__ to create new features. This library seeks to close that gap and the general methodology has been proven effective in both machine learning competitions with the data science machine https github. Clearly this process of manual feature engineering can grow quite tedious with many columns and multiple tables and I certainly don t want to have to do this process by hand Luckily feature tools can automatically perform this entire process and will create more features than we would have ever thought of. An aggregation works across multiple tables using relationships between tables. The irrelevant features can drown out the important features https pdfs. A machine learning model can only learn from the data we give it and making sure that data is relevant to the task is one of the most crucial steps in the machine learning pipeline this is made clear in the excellent paper A Few Useful Things to Know about Machine Learning https homes. Each entity must have a uniquely identifying column known as an index. I threw out some terms there but don t worry because we ll cover them as we go. com feature selection machine learning python from the data. com HDI Project Data Science Machine and business use cases https www. html adding a relationship. In fact having too many features is a significant issue in machine learning because it makes training a model much harder. Already in the dataframe we made by specifying the primitives manually we can see the idea of feature depth. Feature tools is currently the only Python option for this process but with the recent emphasis on automating aspects of the machine learning pipeline other competitiors will probably enter the sphere. These features are combined into a single table that can then be passed on to our model. Ideally there would be an objective method to create an array of diverse new candidate features that we can then use for a machine learning task. org stable modules feature_selection. Feature Tools builds on simple ideas to create a powerful method and we will build up our understanding in much the same way.
