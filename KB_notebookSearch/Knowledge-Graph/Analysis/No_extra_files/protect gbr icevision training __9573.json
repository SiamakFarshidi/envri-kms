Goal of Competition The goal of this competition is to accurately identify starfish in real time by building an object detection model trained on underwater videos of coral reefs. com debarshichanda pytorch w b pawpularity training for more details. Go to offocial website for documentation IceVision IceVision is the first agnostic computer vision framework to offer a curated collection with hundreds of high quality pre trained models from torchvision MMLabs and soon Pytorch Image Models. Weights and Biases is useful in many applications such as Experiment Tracking Hyperparameter Tuning Data Visualization Data and model Versioning Collaborative Reports Go to offocial website for more tutorials and Documentation Pandas Profiling Pandas profiling is an open source Python module with which we can quickly do an exploratory data analysis with just a few lines of code. Unfortunately the reef is under threat in part because of the overpopulation of one particular starfish the coral eating crown of thorns starfish or COTS for short. It orchestrates the end to end deep learning workflow allowing to train networks with easy to use robust high performance libraries such as Pytorch Lightning and Fastai IceVision Unique Features Data curation cleaning with auto fix Access to an exploratory data analysis dashboard Pluggable transforms for better model generalization Access to hundreds of neural net models Acccss to multiple training loop libraries Multi task training to efficiently combine object detection segmentation and classification models Go to offocial website for documentation h1 style font family Lucida Console Courier New monospace background rgb 44 169 201 background linear gradient 180deg rgba 44 169 201 1 0 rgba 1 94 125 1 100 border radius 20px font size 30px text align center Modelling Data ParserData LoaderMetricsTraining h1 style font family Lucida Console Courier New monospace background rgb 44 169 201 background linear gradient 180deg rgba 44 169 201 1 0 rgba 1 94 125 1 100 border radius 20px font size 30px text align center Inference Download File If you come this far you could ve got some insights from this notebook. h1 style background rgb 44 169 201 background linear gradient 180deg rgba 44 169 201 1 0 rgba 1 94 125 1 100 border radius 20px font size 30px Tensorflow Help Protect the Great Barrier Reef Introduction Why this Competition Australia s stunningly beautiful Great Barrier Reef is the world s largest coral reef and home to 1 500 species of fish 400 species of corals 130 species of sharks rays and a massive variety of other sea life. GBRF The Great Barrier Reef Foundation is an Australian non profit organisation established in 1999 to help protect and preserve the Great Barrier Reef. An upvote would be very helpful.
