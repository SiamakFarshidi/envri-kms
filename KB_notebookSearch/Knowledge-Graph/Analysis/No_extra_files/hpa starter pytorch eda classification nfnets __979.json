Human Protein Atlas Single Cell Classification This is a weakly supervised multi label classification problem and a code competition. So lets give it a try. know more about NFNethttps arxiv. png We can make use of NFNet for classificationSince we are experimenting we will only be taking a small batch of 5000 sampleThanks to ateplyuk for the dataset and inference pipelines if you found this notebook helpful please leave an upvote class count for multi classes This shows that most of the samples are single classes compared to multi classes now lets compare between single vs multi label distribution now lets compare between single vs multi label distribution Update the counter images are given in the form of red green blue and yellow get image id get each image channel as a greyscale image second argument 0 in imread display each channel separately imagenet transform setting the target to one hot encoded form train loop. com max 910 1 CjpipU_oChc899f_Esjpyg. 06171 nfnets https miro.
