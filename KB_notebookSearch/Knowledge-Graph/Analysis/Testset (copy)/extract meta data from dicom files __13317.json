Explore training directory Load a Random DICOM Image DICOM files can be read and processed easily with pydicom package. Note 4 Submission kernels will NOT have access to train images so we need to build our models elsewhere and incorporate them into our submissions Evaluation Metrics Every study exam has a row for each label that is scored. Note 2 There are four labels in the training set that are purely informational and require no predictions. If successful you ll help reduce human delays and errors in detection and treatment. Currently CT pulmonary angiography CTPA is the most common type of medical imaging to evaluate patients with suspected PE. Each image has a unique identifier SOPInstanceUID. Extracting DIOCOM files information in a dataframe Baseline Model my favourite style function to plot countplot and piechart for different columns present in the dataset countplots lets visualize trainig data lets read the first dicom image in training dataset display the image read above Invert colors with helper function lets display some 20 images at random Load image image_type dcm. DICOM is most commonly used for storing and transmitting medical images enabling the integration of medical imaging devices such as scanners servers workstations printers network hardware and picture archiving and communication systems PACS from multiple manufacturers. Machine learning could help to more accurately identify PE cases which would make management and treatment more effective for patients. Understanding the Data We have the training and test images as well as train. Every image further has a row for the PE Present on Image label and is uniquely indicated by the SOPInstanceUID. Note 3 Acute PE is not an explicit label but is implied by the lack of Chronic PE or Acute and Chronic PEPredictions must adhere to the expected label hierarchy defined in this diagram and the host will verify that prospective winners have not made conflicting label predictions as detailed on the Prizes page. Now we have read the image in a variable called dcm we can simply print this variable to see the information related to the image There are two things here that I think are significant slice location and the Pixel Data. Note 1 Some labels are Logically Mutually Exclusive predictions must adhere to the expected label hierarchy defined in this diagram and the host will verify that prospective winners have not made conflicting label predictions image. pixel_array and we can then replace the 2000s which are essentially NAs with 0s. The Radiological Society of North America RSNA has teamed up with the Society of Thoracic Radiology STR to help improve the use of machine learning in the diagnosis of PE. With 60 000 100 000 PE deaths annually in the United States it is among the most fatal cardiovascular diseases. It is time consuming to confirm a PE and prone to overdiagnosis. There are 9 study level labels and one image level label. DataFrame from dict. We have 2 directories here train and test both these directories have dicom images for different different patients. What are we predicting In this competition we are predicting a number of labels at both the image and study level. png Above image is a flowchart outlining the relationships between labels. These files may also include patient information to pair the image with the patient. In particular you ll use chest CTPA images grouped together as studies and your data science skills to enable more accurate identification of PE. 07361963i 1 2 N examsk 1 2 n_i where n_i is the number of images in exam iThen let m_i sum_ k 1 to n_i y_ik be the number of positive images in exam i such thatq_i m_i n_i is the proportion of positive images in exam iAt the image level we have a binary classification where the image is classified as PE Present on Image or not image is negative for PE. FileDataset object wraps dict and contains DataElement instances. dcm files represent different slices of a single CT scan. Let p_ik be the predicted probability that y_ik 1.

As the use of imaging continues to grow constraints of radiologists time may contribute to delayed diagnosis. ImagePositionPatient image_orientation_patient dcm. Timely and accurate diagnosis will help these patients receive better care and may also improve outcomes. Exam level weighted log lossLet y_ij 1 if label j was annotated to exam i and y_ij 0 otherwise. ImageType image_position_patient dcm. The binary weighted log loss function for label j on exam i is specified as Lij wj yij log pij 1 yij log 1 pij Image level weighted log lossLet y_ik 1 if image k in exam i was annotated as PE Present on Image otherwise y_ik 0. They are in DICOM format and contain additional metadata that may be relevant to the competition. The images are grouped in directories by study and series. png attachment image. So we need to make a prediction for each image also need to make a prediction for each study label combination at study level. CT scans produce 3D volumes for each scan those volumes consist of 2D slices and each slice is a. The location for each image is given by. These CT scans consist of hundreds of images that require detailed review to identify clots within the pulmonary arteries. Therefore it has a row for each image for which we need to predict the existence of a pulmonary embolism within the image and row for each study label that requires a study level prediction. About the Disease Pulmonary Embolism If every breath is strained and painful it could be a serious and potentially life threatening condition. csv contains the three UIDs noted above and a number of labels. Some are targets which require predictions and some are informational which will also be noted below in Data fields. Metric The metric used in this competition is weighted log loss. It is weighted to account for the relative importance of some labels. We can retrieve a image as a numpy array by calling dcm. csv contains rows for each UID label combination that requires a prediction. They are QA Contrast QA Motion True filling defect not PE Flow artifact Above labels are not scored but are meant to be used as helpers. It has been widely adopted by hospitals and is making inroads into smaller applications like dentists and doctors offices. A pulmonary embolism PE is caused by an artery blockage in the lung. The weights are as follows image. ImageOrientationPatient Convert to a pd. DICOM files allow to store metadata along with pixel data inside them. Reading a dicom file creates a pydicom. Let s Load some more Random DICOM Images This gives us some idea with the sort of images we re dealing with. The image level log loss is written as The total loss is the average of all image and exam level loss divided by the sum of the weights.
