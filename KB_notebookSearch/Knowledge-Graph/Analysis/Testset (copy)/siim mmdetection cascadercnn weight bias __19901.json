Support of multiple frameworks out of box The toolbox directly supports popular and contemporary detection frameworks e. co LP8YffP lung nb2 short. State of the art The toolbox stems from the codebase developed by the MMDet team who won COCO Detection Challenge in 2018. This makes it easy to compare thousands of different models and find the best performing model for different tasks. com sreevishnudamodaran siim covid19 coco 512x512 groupkfoldI will update these datasets if needed when the issues in the discussions regarding the dataset are resolved by the organizers.
