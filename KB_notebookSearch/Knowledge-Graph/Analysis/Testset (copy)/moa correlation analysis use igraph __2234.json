Observations Roughly speaking there seems to be the only ONE group of highly correlated genes all other genes are uncorreled between that group and themselves also. High correlation threshold 0. 3 730PSCan there be some biological interpreation for that big group PSWe use igraph packagesome tutorial examples can be found here https www. In particular we try to select groups of correllated genes using graph utils. com alexandervc igraph cheatsheet Load data First look at features correlations We see that gene is either correlated with ALL viabilities or not correlated again with ALL What does it mean biologically Some genes are crucial for cell survival some not Analysis with graphs Take a correlation matrix and change it with threshold if above put 1 if below put 0. Look at that graph for several thresholds and see the pattern there seems to be only one group of correlated features all other stands separate. 78 and these genes connected between each other by correlation see details below. 2When we decrease threshold correlation threshold threshold say to 0. All other genes are correlated below threshold BOTH between each other and main group. The size of the group depends on how high correlation threshold we put but the picture above does not change. It seems surprising that there is the only one group but not several correlated clusters of features. What is about Analysis of correlated features for MoA context. Construct a graph from it nodes are connected if 1 in matrix. 3 Changing correlation threshold statistics Threshold Correlated component size 0. 6 Analyse several thresholds.
