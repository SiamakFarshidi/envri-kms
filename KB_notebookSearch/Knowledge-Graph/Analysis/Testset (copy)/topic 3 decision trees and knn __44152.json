Classification Decision Trees and k Nearest Neighbors Article outline1. If we randomly pull out a ball then it will be blue with probability p_1 frac 9 20 and yellow with probability p_2 frac 11 20 which gives us an entropy S_0 frac 9 20 log_2 frac 9 20 frac 11 20 log_2 frac 11 20 approx 1. In the second and third cases the distances between the examples are stored in a tree to accelerate finding nearest neighbors. But what if the age range is large Or what if another quantitative variable salary can also be cut in many ways There will be too many binary attributes to select from at each step during tree construction. These curves are called validation curves. The method adapts quite easily for the regression problem on step 3 it returns not the class but the number a mean or median of the target variable among neighbors. For now we ll refer to a simple metric for classification algorithms the proportion of correct answers accuracy on the test set. left build L_left t. Thus we reserve a fraction of the training set typically from 20 to 40 train the model on the remaining data 60 80 of the original set and compute performance metrics for the model e. And a lecture https youtu. The optimal decision tree search problem is NP complete. org stable documentation. One can see that k NN with the Euclidean distance does not work well on the problem even when you vary the number of nearest neighbors over a wide range. For example before the introduction of scalable machine learning algorithms the credit scoring task in the banking sector was solved by experts. That is only a few values for comparisons by age and salary were searched. com open machine learning course open machine learning course topic 3 classification decision trees and k nearest neighbors 8613c6b6d2cd based on this notebook Course materials as a Kaggle Dataset https www. There are 9 blue balls and 11 yellow balls. A straight line will be too simple while some complex curve snaking by each red dot will be too complex and will lead us to making mistakes on new samples. Application Examples and Complex Cases Decision trees and nearest neighbors method in a customer churn prediction task Let s read data into a DataFrame and preprocess it. More details can be found here https sebastianraschka. be RrVYO6Td9Js Medium story https medium. 5 Let s consider a more complex example by adding the Salary variable in the thousands of dollars per year. If you were instead predicting by how much time the loan payment is overdue this would become a regression problem. This will help us formalize effective data splitting which we alluded to in the context of 20 Questions. In the classification problem one of the features will just be proportional to the vector of responses but this won t help for the nearest neighbors method. Let s train a decision tree and k NN with our random parameters. html class are max_depth the maximum depth of the tree max_features the maximum number of features with which to search for the best partition this is necessary with a large number of features because it would be expensive to search for partitions for all features min_samples_leaf the minimum number of samples in a leaf. This impairs the interpretability of the model. As a rule it does not work well when there are a lot of features due to the curse of dimensionality. 941 The conclusion of this experiment and general advice first check simple models on your data decision tree and nearest neighbors next time we will also add logistic regression to this list. com ods_mlcourse details are outlined on the mlcourse. Assignments Demo versionTo practice with building classification decision trees with Scikit learn you can complete this demo assignment https www. Decision Tree in a Regression ProblemWhen predicting a numeric variable the idea of a tree construction remains the same but the quality criteria changes Variance Large D frac 1 ell sum limits_ i 1 ell y_i frac 1 ell sum limits_ j 1 ell y_j 2 where ell is the number of samples in a leaf y_i is the value of the target variable. be p9Hny3Cs6rk on YouTube Decision trees and k Nearest Neighbors are covered practically in every ML book. Application Examples and Complex Cases 5. Due to this understandability and similarity to human decision making you can easily explain your model to your boss decision trees have gained immense popularity. If we calculate information gain for each partition in that manner we can select the thresholds for comparison of each numeric feature before the construction of a large tree using all features. If you look at it as a classification problem it seems very simple the classes are separated by a line. ExampleClassification and regression are supervised learning problems. Even if that were true in training we do not want our classification model to generate such specific rules. Class DecisionTreeClassifier in Scikit learnThe main parameters of the sklearn. Conclusion the simplest heuristics for handling numeric features in a decision tree is to sort its values in ascending order and check only those thresholds where the value of the target variable changes. Next let s do the same experiment as in the previous task but this time let s change the ranges for tunable parameters. Machine learning for this case boils down to choosing a good separating border. 3 despite being trained for much longer. In unsupervised learning tasks one has a set consisting of instances described by a set of features. Recall the game of 20 Questions which is often referenced when introducing decision trees. The decision tree did better the percentage of correct answers is about 94 decision tree versus 88 k NN. Cross validation provides a better assessment of the model quality on new data compared to the hold out set approach. According to the nearest neighbors method the green ball would be classified as blue rather than red. leaf_size optional threshold for switching to grid search if the algorithm for finding neighbors is BallTree or KDTree metric minkowski manhattan euclidean chebyshev or other. We can exaggerate this story further and find that all four clients who came to the bank for a loan in green trousers did not return the loan. You would be right to point out that we have not tuned any RandomForestClassifier parameters here. Nearest Neighbors Method The nearest neighbors method k Nearest Neighbors or k NN is another very popular classification method that is also sometimes used in regression problems. Decision Trees and k NN in a Task of MNIST Handwritten Digits RecognitionNow let s have a look at how these 2 algorithms perform on a real world task. algo eval CV Holdout DT 0. Now let s identify the parameters for the tree using cross validation. This problem is tackled with decision tree ensembles discussed next time. com amueller scipy 2017 sklearn by Alex Gramfort and Andreas Mueller. Now let s tune the number of neighbors k for k NN Here the tree proved to be better than the nearest neighbors algorithm 94. ResearchGate https www. These guys work hard on writing really clear documentation. ai Open Machine Learning Course Author Yury Kashnitsky https www. The parameters of the tree need to be set depending on input data and it is usually done by means of cross validation more on this below. Let s create a set of points on a plane 2 features each point will be one of two classes 1 for red or 1 for yellow. The information gain is roughly 0. Now let s make predictions on our holdout set. Difficulties to support missing values in the data. In our example with the yellow and blue balls it would mean that the model gives the same predictions for all balls with positions 19 or 0. How can we read such a tree In the beginning there were 200 samples instances 100 of each class. Why did the tree choose these features Because they gave better partitioning according to Gini uncertainty. The entropy of the initial state was maximal S 1. If we wanted to do well in that case a tree with fewer questions or splits would be more accurate even if it does not perfectly fit the training set. Suppose we have the following dataset Let s sort it by age in ascending order. Decision Tree We begin our overview of classification and regression methods with one of the most popular ones a decision tree. Translated and edited by Christina Butsko Gleb Filatov and Yuanyuan Pao https www. Different algorithms use different heuristics for early stopping or cut off to avoid constructing an overfitted tree. Nearest Neighbors Method 4. This decision tree may not work well if we add any balls because it has perfectly fit to the training set initial 20 balls. 5 the left subgroup will have an entropy of 0 all clients are bad and the right one will have an entropy of 0. That is to say the gender feature separates the celebrity dataset much better than other features like Angelina Jolie Spanish or loves football. For another example if you do not know how to tag a Bluetooth headset on an online listing you can find 5 similar headsets and if 4 of them are tagged as accessories and only 1 as Technology then you will also label it under accessories. In supervised learning problems there s also a target variable which is what we would like to be able to predict known for each instance in a training set. What question will the guesser ask first Of course they will ask the one that narrows down the number of the remaining options the most. Separating border built by a decision tree has its limitations it consists of hyperplanes perpendicular to one of the coordinate axes which is inferior in quality to some other methods in practice. However cross validation is computationally expensive when you have a lot of data. 954 3 bad and 5 good you can check this yourself as it will be part of the assignment. Good to search for decision trees and k NN. Also imagine how badly the tree will generalize to the space beyond the 30 times 30 squares that frame the training set. Mitchell s book Machine Learning 1997 gives a classic general definition of machine learning as follows A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T as measured by P improves with experience E. both the model itself the tree and prediction for a certain test object a path in the tree can be interpreted. Asking Is it Angelina Jolie would in the case of a negative response leave all but one celebrity in the realm of possibility. But this is only one heuristic there exists others Gini uncertainty Gini impurity G 1 sum limits_k p_k 2. Now let s tune our model parameters using cross validation as before but now we ll take into account that we have more features than in the previous task 64. kNN works better on this dataset. The tree looks for the values at which the target class switches its value as a threshold for cutting a quantitative variable. The higher the entropy the less ordered the system and vice versa. html blog post by Sebastian Raschka or in any classic textbook on machine statistical learning. To classify each sample from the test set one needs to perform the following operations in order 1. Let s draw some handwritten digits. Misclassification error E 1 max limits_k p_k In practice misclassification error is almost never used and Gini uncertainty and information gain work similarly. One of the most prominent scientific papers on this subject is On the handling of continuous valued attributes in decision tree generation UM Fayyad. org stable modules generated sklearn. Decision trees perform very well and even random forest let s think of it for now as a bunch of trees that work better together in this example cannot achieve much better performance 95. This material is subject to the terms and conditions of the license Creative Commons CC BY NC SA 4. This is often done in one of two ways setting aside a part of the dataset held out hold out set. And how does the tree itself look We see that the tree cuts the space into 8 rectangles i. We need to avoid overfitting by pruning setting a minimum number of samples in each leaf or defining a maximum depth for the tree. The book Machine Learning in Action P. ExampleLet s consider fitting a decision tree to some synthetic data. Weights of neighbors each neighbor may contribute different weights for example the further the sample the lower the weight. Category 1 into a tree like data structure. Choosing Model Parameters and Cross Validation 4. For the right group we can easily see that we only need one extra partition using coordinate less than or equal to 18. A good overview is provided in the Machine Learning basics chapter of Deep Learning http www. com kashnitsky mlcourse If you read Russian an article https habrahabr. For example using the above scheme the bank can explain to the client why they were denied for a loan e. The underlying intuition is that you look like your neighbors. Support course creatorsYou can make a monthly Patreon or one time Ko Fi donation we don t like warnings you can comment the following 2 lines if you d like to first class adding second class Let s write an auxiliary function that will return grid for further visualization. 935 first feature is proportional to target other features are noise. training the tree some code to depict separating surface pip install pydotplus for kNN we need to scale features 0. The most frequent case here is k fold cross validation. We see that the tree partitioned by both salary and age. com dyakonov a former top 1 kaggler loves the simplest k NN but with the tuned object similarity metric Good interpretability. At the heart of the popular algorithms for decision tree construction such as ID3 or C4. The process is to construct a tree of depth 1 compute the entropy or Gini uncertainty and select the best thresholds for comparison. In contrast the decision tree easily detects hidden dependencies in the data despite a restriction on the maximum depth. Let s draw the resulting tree. If we plot these two functions against the argument p_ we will see that the entropy plot is very close to the plot of Gini uncertainty doubled. Furthermore when there are a lot of numeric features in a dataset each with a lot of unique values only the top N of the thresholds described above are selected i. The most common ways to deal with overfitting in decision trees are as follows artificial limitation of the depth or a minimum number of samples in the leaves the construction of a tree just stops at some point pruning the tree. We have successfully constructed a decision tree that predicts ball color based on its position. Bonus versionYou can also choose a Bonus Assignments tier https www. right build L_right return t Other Quality Criteria for Splits in Classification ProblemsWe discussed how entropy allows us to formalize partitions in a tree. com rushter MLAlgorithms of many ML algorithms. Class KNeighborsClassifier in Scikit learnThe main parameters of the class sklearn. If we sort by age the target class loan default switches from 1 to 0 or vice versa 5 times. Simply put by minimizing the variance we look for features that divide the training set in such a way that the values of the target feature in each leaf are roughly equal. KNeighborsClassifier are weights uniform all weights are equal distance the weight is inversely proportional to the distance from the test sample or any other user defined function algorithm optional brute ball_tree KD_tree or auto. Therefore in practice these two criteria are almost identical. Friedman estimated that it took about 50 of the code to support gaps in data in CART an improved version of this algorithm is implemented in sklearn. 94256322331761677 0. At the bottom of the tree at some great depth there will be partitions on less important features e. Pictures here are 8x8 matrices intensity of white color for each pixel. com diefimov MTH594_MachineLearning with very good materials. Dependency on the selected distance metric between the objects. com blog post Discretizing a continuous variable using Entropy. The assignment is just for you to practice and goes with a solution https www. The decision tree as a machine learning algorithm is essentially the same thing as the diagram shown above we incorporate a stream of logical rules of the form feature a value is less than x and feature b value is less than y. One more ML course https github. Decision trees are used in everyday life decisions not just in machine learning. Note that most of these metrics require data to be scaled. To resolve this problem heuristics are usually used to limit the number of thresholds to which we compare the quantitative variable. com watch v QKTuw4PNOsU list PLVlY_7IJCMJeRfZ68eVfEcu UcN9BbwiX mlcourse. There are exceptions if the number of neighbors is large the interpretability deteriorates We did not give him a loan because he is similar to the 350 clients of which 70 are the bad and that is 12 higher than the average for the dataset. Such metrics differ for various problems and algorithms and we ll discuss them as we study new algorithms. But what variable to look at first Let s discuss a simple example where all the variables are binary. ai and YouTube channel https www. where p_ is the probability of an object having a label. Professor Pedro Domingos a well known member in the ML community talks about it here https homes. The nearest neighbors methodPros Simple implementation Well studied Typically the method is a good first solution not only for classification or regression but also recommendations It can be adapted to a certain problem by choosing the right metrics or kernel in a nutshell the kernel may set the similarity operation for complex objects such as graphs while keeping the k NN approach the same. Formally the information gain IG for a split based on the variable Q in this example it s a variable x leq 12 is defined as Large IG Q S_O sum_ i 1 q frac N_i N S_i where q is the number of groups after the split N_i is number of objects from the sample in which variable Q is equal to the i th value. In the case of a small number of neighbors the method is sensitive to outliers that is it is inclined to overfit. Let s allocate 70 of the set for training X_train y_train and 30 for the hold out set X_holdout y_holdout. But for the left group we need three more. This parameter prevents creating trees where any leaf would have only a few members. More formally the method follows the compactness hypothesis if the distance between the examples is measured well enough then similar examples are much more likely to belong to the same class. The method of one nearest neighbor does better than the tree but is still not as good as a linear classifier our next topic. It turns out that dividing the balls into two groups by splitting on coordinate is less than or equal to 12 gave us a more ordered system. In the first case the nearest neighbors for each test case are computed by a grid search over the training set. 211 find this part of the border in the picture above. This like decision trees is one of the most comprehensible approaches to classification. The quality of classification regression with k NN depends on several parameters The number of neighbors k. remove a feature add some objects. We do not know what parameters are good so we will assume some random ones a tree depth of 5 and the number of nearest neighbors equal 10. In our example our split yielded two groups q 2 one with 13 elements N_1 13 the other with 7 N_2 7. We will discuss the problem of overfitting later. To illustrate further 43. 97 6 bad and 4 good and the right one will have the entropy of 0 a group containing only one object. k NN predictions as input to other models or for stacking blending The nearest neighbors method extends to other tasks like recommendation systems. Let s consider an example. We see that the decision tree approximates the data with a piecewise constant function. The class of the test sample will be the most frequent class among those k nearest neighbors. For example Higher School of Economics publishes information diagrams to make the lives of its employees easier. com a simple guide to entropy based discretization or Discretizing a continuous variable using Entropy http clear lines. It might be the case that these methods already work well enough. Simply speaking we do not want the salary feature which is on the order of thousands to affect the distance more than age which is generally less than 100. Let s select 70 of the dataset for training X_train y_train and 30 for holdout X_holdout y_holdout. Let s construct curves reflecting the dependence of these quantities on the n_neighbors parameter in the method of nearest neighbors. net publication 29467751_Top_10_algorithms_in_data_mining. Complex Case for the Nearest Neighbors MethodLet s consider another simple example. However more likely this a disadvantage of using Euclidean distance here. Cons The trees are very sensitive to the noise in input data the whole model could change if the training set is slightly modified e. Then the procedure is repeated recursively until the entropy is zero or some small value to account for overfitting. com kashnitsky a3 demo decision trees. We got this overly complex construction although the solution is just a straight line x_1 x_2. A notable feature of this approach is its laziness calculations are only done during the prediction phase when a test sample needs to be classified. Implementations https github. Again we see that 95 is the average between 88 and 102 the individual with a salary of 88k proved to be bad while the one with 102k was good. the tree has 8 leaves. Due to the fact that it is not entirely a toy example its maximum depth is 6 the picture is not that small but you can walk over the tree if you click on the picture. Finally the third term used in the definition of machine learning is a metric of the algorithm s performance evaluation P. Let s take a look at two supervised learning problems classification and regression. A decision tree is often a generalization of the experts experience a means of sharing knowledge of a particular process. Let s visualize the resulting separating boundary. pythondef build L create node t if the stopping criterion is True assign a predictive model to t else Find the best binary split L L_left L_right t. Nearest Neighbors Method 3. Since we cannot immediately check the model performance on new incoming data because we do not know the true values of the target variable yet it is necessary to sacrifice a small portion of the data to check the quality of the model on it. org by Ian Goodfellow Yoshua Bengio Aaron Courville 2016. In the second example the tree solved the problem perfectly while k NN experienced difficulties. How will the tree choose features now Let s see. Calculate the distance to each of the samples in the training set. A decision tree will look for the best according to some criterion of information gain split by checking binary attributes such as Age 17 Age 22. org licenses by nc sa 4. Note that overfitting is an issue for all machine learning methods. g the client does not own a house and her income is less than 5 000. The right group has 7 balls 1 blue and 6 yellow. Nearest neighbors is a well studied approach. 949 max_depth 9 max_features 6 0. 5 e x 2 2 with some noise. In the various problem settings T P and E can refer to completely different things. edu pedrod papers cacm12. Let s train 2 models decision tree and k NN. EntropyShannon s entropy is defined for a system with N possible states as follows Large S sum_ i 1 N p_i log_2 p_i where p_i is the probability of finding the system in the i th state. 838 kNN 0. KB Irani Machine Learning 1992. 89 max_depth 6 max_features 17 0. The hold out set will not be involved in tuning the parameters of the models. Let s continue to divide them into groups until the balls in each group are all of the same color. In k fold cross validation the model is trained K times on different K 1 subsets of the original dataset in white and checked on the remaining subset each time a different one shown above in orange. However the border that the decision tree builds is too complicated plus the tree itself is very deep. Under other split conditions the resulting tree would be deeper i. Pros and Cons of Decision Trees and the Nearest Neighbors Method 6. 0 https creativecommons. ai course repo https github. Intuitively some smooth boundary or at least a straight line or a hyperplane would work well on new data. pdf in his popular paper A Few Useful Things to Know about Machine Learning also the curse of dimensionality is described in the Deep Learning book in this chapter http www. The picture below is an example of a dividing border built in an overfitted tree. ai lectures on decision trees theory https youtu. We ll use it at the end after tuning to assess the quality of the resulting model. Note that this performance is achieved by using random parameters. The advantage of this algorithm is that they are easily interpretable. We obtain K model quality assessments that are usually averaged to give an overall average quality of classification regression. In our next case we solve a binary classification problem approve deny a loan based on the Age Home ownership Income and Education features. ExampleLet s generate some data distributed by the function f x e x 2 1. The initial decision could be a recommendation of a product or service that is popular among the closest neighbors of the person for whom we want to make a recommendation In practice on large datasets approximate methods of search are often used for nearest neighbors. 666 max_depth 20 max_features 64 0. Harrington will walk you through implementations of classic ML algorithms in pure Python. We will train the first model without the State feature and then we will see if it helps. The holdout set will not participate in model parameters tuning we will use it at the end to check the quality of the resulting model. This target variable is just a fact of loan default 1 or 0 so recall that this is a binary classification problem. And if we sort by salary it switches 7 times. We will predict the color of the ball based on its position. We see that the tree used the following 5 values to evaluate by age 43. This value by itself may not tell us much but let s see how the value changes if we were to break the balls into two groups with the position less than or equal to 12 and greater than 12. Crucial Tree ParametersTechnically you can build a decision tree until each leaf has exactly one instance but this is not common in practice when building a single tree because it will be overfitted or too tuned to the training set and will not predict labels for new data well. This task is an example where k NN works surprisingly well. Let s train a random forest on the same dataset it works better than kNN on the majority of datasets. Application Examples and Complex Cases 6. Within each rectangle the tree will make the prediction according to the majority label of the objects inside it. If you look closely these are exactly the mean values between the ages at which the target class switches from 1 to 0 or 0 to 1. Nearest Neighbors Method in Real Applications k NN can serve as a good starting point baseline in some cases In Kaggle competitions k NN is often used for the construction of meta features i. You ve probably played this game one person thinks of a celebrity while the other tries to guess by asking only Yes or No questions. This reasoning corresponds to the concept of information gain based on entropy. com with the same material. Since entropy is in fact the degree of chaos or uncertainty in the system the reduction in entropy is called information gain. The authors of the classic book The Elements of Statistical Learning consider k NN to be a theoretically ideal algorithm which usage is only limited by computation power and the curse of dimensionality https en. Then we will train a tree with this data and predictions that the tree makes. The same goes for 30. take more questions to reach an answer. for each and a target variable whether they defaulted on the loan. If we split by Salary leq 95 the left subgroup will have the entropy of 0. Let s list the best parameters and the corresponding mean accuracy from cross validation. Even with tuning the training accuracy doesn t reach 98 as it did with one nearest neighbor. To illustrate if we split by Salary leq 34. Useful resources 8. In this visualization the more samples of the first class the darker the orange color of the vertex the more samples of the second class the darker the blue. 6 accuracy for cross validation and hold out respectively. Results Legend CV and Holdout are average shares of the correct answers on cross model validation and hold out sample. It helps with hyperparameter tuning model comparison feature evaluation etc. By the way Alexander Dyakonov https www. No model is constructed from the training examples beforehand. In the case of one nearest neighbor we were able to reach 99 guesses on cross validation. Let s see the best parameters combination and the corresponding accuracy from cross validation That has already passed 66 but not quite 97. Entropy can be described as the degree of chaos in the system. Therefore we can compute the information gain as Large IG x leq 12 S_0 frac 13 20 S_1 frac 7 20 S_2 approx 0. In contrast recall that for decision trees in the first half of this article the tree is constructed based on the training set and the classification of test cases occurs relatively quickly by traversing through the tree. 5 years of age and 95k and 30. That is a decision tree makes constant prediction for the objects that lie beyond the bounding box set by the training set in the feature space. We see that they are distinguishable. We will use max_depth parameter that limits the depth of the tree. How a Decision Tree Works with Numerical FeaturesSuppose we have a numeric feature Age that has a lot of unique values. Here is the essence of how the GridSearchCV works for each unique pair of values of max_depth and max_features compute model performance with 5 fold cross validation and then select the best combination of parameters. 5 is the average of 38 and 49 years a 38 year old customer failed to return the loan whereas the 49 year old did. We can see that k NN did much better but note that this is with random parameters. Maximizing this criterion can be interpreted as the maximization of the number of pairs of objects of the same class that are in the same subtree not to be confused with the Gini index. The decision to grant a loan was made on the basis of some intuitively or empirically derived rules that could be represented as a decision tree. Pros and Cons of Decision Trees and the Nearest Neighbors Method Decision treesPros Generation of clear human understandable classification rules e. For binary classification entropy and Gini uncertainty take the following form S p_ log_2 p_ p_ log_2 p_ p_ log_2 p_ 1 p_ log_2 1 p_ G 1 p_ 2 p_ 2 1 p_ 2 1 p_ 2 2p_ 1 p_. For example as a credit institution we may want to predict loan defaults based on the data accumulated about our clients. Decision trees can be easily visualized i. ru company ods blog 322534 on Habr. At the beginning the number of samples from two classes is equal so the root node of the tree is white. The information gain is about 0. We will generate samples from two classes both normal distributions but with different means. Complex Case for Decision TreesTo continue the discussion of the pros and cons of the methods in question let s consider a simple classification task where a tree would perform well but does it in an overly complicated manner. Cross validation is a very important technique in machine learning and can also be applied in statistics and econometrics. Free use is permitted for any non commercial purpose. There is a number of open source libraries that implement such algorithms check out Spotify s library Annoy https github. This is a very important concept used in physics information theory and other areas. DecisionTreeClassifier. Small number of model parameters. There are no theoretical ways to choose the number of neighbors only grid search though this is often true for all hyperparameters of all models. Store State in a separate Series object for now and remove it from the dataframe. Useful resources 1. The model can only interpolate but not extrapolate the same is true for random forests and tree boosting. org wiki Curse_of_dimensionality. The entropy of the right group is S_2 frac 1 7 log_2 frac 1 7 frac 6 7 log_2 frac 6 7 approx 0. As we ll see later many other models although more accurate do not have this property and can be regarded as more of a black box approach where it is harder to interpret how the input data was transformed into the output. Scipy 2017 scikit learn tutorial https github. 5 lies the principle of greedy maximization of information gain at each step the algorithm chooses the variable that gives the greatest information gain upon splitting. Given this information why do you think it makes no sense here to consider a feature like Age 17. com kashnitsky a3 demo decision trees solution. g accuracy on the hold out set. If a dataset has many variables it is difficult to find the right weights and to determine which features are not important for classification regression. There are two exceptions where the trees are built to the maximum depth Random Forest a group of trees averages the responses from individual trees that are built to the maximum depth we will talk later on why you should do this Pruning trees. It did not allow us to reveal that one feature was much better than the others. This is a lot of information but hopefully this article will be a great reference for you for a long time 7. Cons Method considered fast in comparison with compositions of algorithms but the number of neighbors used for classification is usually large 100 150 in real life in which case the algorithm will not operate as fast as a decision tree. Experience E refers to data we can t go anywhere without it. The entropy of this group is S_1 frac 5 13 log_2 frac 5 13 frac 8 13 log_2 frac 8 13 approx 0. Here the experience E is the available training data a set of instances clients a collection of features such as age salary type of loan past loan defaults etc. Choosing Model Parameters and Cross Validation 5. if age 25 and is interested in motorcycles deny the loan. We will use the sklearn built in dataset on handwritten digits. DT stands for a decision tree k NN stands for k nearest neighbors RF stands for random forest. This property is called interpretability of the model. com blog 2016 model evaluation selection part1. Then each such matrix is unfolded into a vector of length 64 and we obtain a feature description of an object. only use the top N that give maximum gain. Moreover the thresholds for feature comparisons are 43. In one more bonus assignment a more challenging one you ll be guided through an __implementation of a decision tree from scratch__. There exist many important theorems claiming that on endless datasets it is the optimal method of classification. IntroductionBefore we dive into the material for this week s article let s talk about the kind of problem that we are going to solve and its place in the exciting field of machine learning. Then from the bottom up some nodes of the tree are removed by comparing the quality of the tree with and without that partition comparison is performed using cross validation more on this below. We recommend Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning C. As always we will look at the accuracy for cross validation and the hold out set. Fast training and forecasting. How to Build a Decision TreeEarlier we saw that the decision to grant a loan is made based on age assets income and other variables. DecisionTreeClassifier http scikit learn. We ll tune the maximum depth and the maximum number of features used at each split. Some heuristics are used in practice such as greedy search for a feature with maximum information gain but it does not guarantee finding the globally optimal tree. In this approach the tree is first constructed to the maximum depth. Supports both numerical and categorical features. More examples of numeric feature discretization can be found in posts like A Simple Guide to Entropy Based Discretization http kevinmeurer. Let s assess prediction quality on our hold out set with a simple metric the proportion of correct answers accuracy. whether a client came from Leeds or New York. If you set this parameter to auto the right way to find the neighbors will be automatically chosen based on the training set. be H4XlBTPv5rQ and practical part https youtu. Machine learning algorithms can be divided into those that are trained in supervised or unsupervised manner. 5 a representative of this group of classification methods is even the first in the list of 10 best data mining algorithms Top 10 Algorithms in Data Mining Knowledge and Information Systems 2008. In terms of machine learning one can see it as a simple classifier that determines the appropriate form of publication book article chapter of the book preprint publication in the Higher School of Economics and the Media based on the content book pamphlet paper type of journal original publication type scientific journal proceedings etc. The left group has 13 balls 8 blue and 5 yellow. Scikit learn http scikit learn. The distance measure between samples common ones include Hamming Euclidean cosine and Minkowski distances. Useful resources Main course site https mlcourse. Selecting the Euclidean distance by default is often unfounded. Here is a snippet of instructions for publishing a paper on the Institution portal. Small changes to the data can significantly change the decision tree. Flow diagrams are actually visual representations of decision trees. The process continues up to depth 3. But we here have an exception. ai main page and get a non demo version of the assignment where you ll applying decision trees to cardiovascular decease data. Note that the entropy of a group where all of the balls are the same color is equal to 0 log_2 1 0. As you can see entropy has decreased in both groups more so in the right group. Tree building AlgorithmWe can make sure that the tree built in the previous example is optimal it took only 5 questions conditioned on the variable x to perfectly fit a decision tree to the training set. With that the entropy of both left and right groups decreased. Bishop and Machine Learning A Probabilistic Perspective K. Some of the most popular tasks T in machine learning are the following classification of an instance to one of the categories based on its features regression prediction of a numerical target feature based on other features of an instance clustering identifying partitions of instances based on the features of these instances so that the members within the groups are more similar to each other than those in the other groups anomaly detection search for instances that are greatly dissimilar to the rest of the sample or to some group of instances and so many more. Choosing Model Parameters and Cross Validation The main task of learning algorithms is to be able to generalize to unseen data. Then the first partition of the samples into 2 groups was made by comparing the value of x_2 with 1. Pros and Cons of Decision Trees and the Nearest Neighbors Method 7. Informally the classification problem in this case is to build some good boundary separating the two classes the red dots from the yellow. You can find a good solution by grid searching over parameters but this becomes very time consuming for large datasets. Toy ExampleTo illustrate how entropy can help us identify good features for building a decision tree let s look at a toy example. Let s try to separate these two classes by training an Sklearn decision tree. Select k samples from the training set with the minimal distance to them.
