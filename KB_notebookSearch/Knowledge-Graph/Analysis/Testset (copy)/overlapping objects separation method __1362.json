With solution to this challenge we ll have a better chance to test and find cures faster for ill childrens. 0 line is bigger than split line and 2. separation line is valid if parallel line with offset 2 is shorter than offset 5 and if offset 5 is wider than separation line. This is checked in both directions. Kind regards This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed It is defined by the kaggle python docker image https github. round objects doesn t have inset corners if corners are present you can asume that this is overlapping scenario. extract inset corners by substract convex hull from object. Now let s try on whole image Hold my beer Amazing I would like to thank to all brains that contributes to this challenge. Disclaimer This is not a AI There are some overlapping nuclei let s try to separate them. read_csv Input data files are available in the. find all combinations of corners for separation candidate some optimizations like crop boundaries are used just for speed up. It s not perfect but it can help you with instance separation in some cases of overlapped round objects. My solution is classic minimal UNet with this post processing currently at 0. For example running this by clicking run or pressing Shift Enter will list the files in the input directory Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output. Bunch of IF s and simple algebra Let s try it out Maybe we can separate grapes with it Looks good. Overlapping objects separation method Hi Kagglers I wan t to share my solution for separation of overlapping objects by using intuition and simple linear algebra I have construted this method. we dont need and dont like warnings this is dangerous world we are living in combine masks as one input validation get center point extend line to image bound is vertical line not vertical calculate slope use skimage line for better slope calculation calculate b y mx b out of bound handling get min max Y recalculate X out of bound handling get min max Y recalculate X check infinity get extended line get index of center point trim line to mask there are some situations where issue occurs line outside image but I haven t had the time to add validation get left and right part of the line this is not actually direction of line but indexation of array trim to mask out of image bounds better way will be to pad image with 1px False border but this is faster invalid line invalid line invalid line return line coordinates parallel line helper function calculate line distance get top parallel line extend line to bound get line length get bottom parallel line extend line to bound if top and bottom line are longer than split line extend line to bound get line length get bottom parallel line extend line to bound if top and bottom line are longer than split line if 5.
