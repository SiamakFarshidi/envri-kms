Fact sheet Cassava green mottle 068 pestnet. Leaves of plants affected by CMD have marked reductions and distortions of the chloroplasts increased respiration and peroxidase activity and decreased total carbohydrate and rates of photosynthesis. The bacterium lies dormant in the seed embryo with dormancy breaking shortly after theseeds begin germination. The first few leaves produced by an infected cutting are sometimes symptomless and are subsequently followed by severely affected leaves but there is a tendency for symptom severity to diminish as plants age especially in resistant varieties.

Leaflets may show a uniform mosaic pattern or the mosaic pattern is localised to a few areas which are often at the bases. Unlike symptoms induced by the majority of plant viruses those of CBSD in cassava normally affect mature or nearly mature leaves but not expanding immature leaves. Whether it also spreads in seed of cassava is unknown. How this infection occurred is unknown but there are several possibilities. The symptoms of the disease vary greatly with variety and environmental conditions making diagnosis difficult particularly when plants are infected both with CBSD and cassava mosaic disease. Occasionally plants become severely stunted edible roots are absent or if present they are small and woody when cooked. However symptoms may recur on recovered plants when environmental conditions again favour symptom expression Gibson and Otim Nape 1997. Cassava brown streak viruses CABI https www. This behaviour is influenced by the ambient temperature and host plant resistance. org isc datasheet 2747 Healthy. Variation in symptoms may be due to differences in virus strain the sensitivity of the host genotype plant age and environmental factors such as soil fertility soil moisture availability radiation and particularly temperature. As the disease progresses the diseased shoots die so that the plants show the characteristic dieback symptoms with bare leafless stems pointing upward Photo CBB 6. The vascular bundles of infected petioles and stems are also necrotic appearing as brown or black bands. In a trial on Choiseul 4 of plants grown from cuttings taken from Guadalcanal became diseased within 250 days from planting. Plants touching each other in the wind may have transferred sap between those infected and healthy. Label Distribution Visualization Cassava Bacterial Blight CBB What is Cassava Bacterial Blight CBB The first sign of the disease is wilting and dying of leaves Photo CBB 1 2. The virus species UCBSV and CBSV cannot be differentiated according to symptoms induced in cassava. They consist of a characteristic yellow or necrotic vein banding which may enlarge and coalesce to form comparatively large yellow patches. Physiological and histological examinations reveal that infected leaves have palisade cells that are either short or undifferentiated from those of the spongy mesophyll tissues Chant and Beck 1959. Some leaves situated between affected ones may seem normal and give the appearance of recovery. Symptoms tend to reappear on the axillary growth after the shoot tips are removed. Leaf and or stem symptoms can occur without the development of tuber symptoms thus of plants with above ground symptoms surveyed in southern Tanzania 21 failed to develop root necrosis Hillocks et al. Cassava mosaic disease African cassava mosaic CABI https www. edu diseases cassava bacterial blight Cassava Brown Streak Disease CBSD What is Brown Streak Disease CBSD The name brown streak was given to the disease from the brown lesions which sometimes appear on young green stems. These were the first symptoms of the disease to be recognised however stem lesions are not the most characteristic symptom of infection and occur only infrequently. The leaf wilting is accompanied by a viscous amber to orange coloured exudation from the leaf stalks petioles and young stems Photos CBB 3 5. Thirty percent of the seed of infected tobacco plants was infected. Changes have also been observed in the peroxidase isoenzyme components of CMD affected plants Bates and Chant 1970 Chant et al. The chlorotic areas are usually clearly demarcated and vary in size from that of a whole leaflet to small flecks or spots. In the lab the virus can be passed between plants in sap and also in seed. Usually the shoots recover from symptoms and appear healthy. When large numbers of adjacent plants exhibit the dieback symptoms the crop appears as a forest of leafless stems which gives rise to the name in French of la maladie des cierges or candle disease Photo CBB 7. htm Cassava Mosaic Disease CMD What is Cassava Mosaic Disease CMD The symptoms of CMD first described fully by Storey and Nichols 1938 occur as characteristic leaf mosaic patterns that affect discrete areas and are determined at an early stage of leaf development. The lesions enlarge and eventually coalesce along the veins or edges of the leaf killing the leaf. However several cassava cultivars are not susceptible to UCBSV Winter et al. However there are other possibilities. Seed is not used for growing cassava so spread on Choiseul is most likely in diseased cuttings. Tuberous root symptoms may also be present these consist of dark brown necrotic areas within the tuber and reduction in root size lesions in roots can result in post harvest spoilage of the crop. The earliest symptoms visible on cassava leaves are dark greenish water soaked areas limited by the leaf veins and which show gummy exudation on the water soaked areas Photo CBB 8. Leaf chlorosis may be pale yellow or nearly white with only a tinge of green or just discernibly paler than normal. Symptoms vary from leaf to leaf shoot to shoot and plant to plant even of the same variety and virus strain in the same locality. De topping is sometimes adopted to enhance expression in screening clones for resistance Jennings 1960. Distortion reduction in leaflet size and general stunting appear to be secondary effects associated with symptom severity. There is also the possibility of spread by nematodes and pollen. No symptoms of CBB have been recorded on or in cassava roots. There have been reports that seeds from CBB diseased plants that carry a high load of the pathogen are sometimes deformed and necrotic but the consensus is that CBB infected seeds are asymptomatic carriers and that there are no diagnostic symptoms of CBB on cassava seeds.
