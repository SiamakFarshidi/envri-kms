View newly generated data Model building and trainingNext we build our model by calling unet. Let me know what you think could be improved better explained or what you think is a better approach. com Nelson Gon cytounet tree master cytounet. I have found dice_coef not to work very well so far. If you would like to contribute to this work please do so at cytounet https github. ResultsFrom these results it is clear that our model is overfitting on our dataset. More importantly I have fixed issues with load_augmentations that flipped images. org bbbc BBBC009 Cloning the repositoryIn this notebook as stated above we use cytounet an implementation of the Unet algorithm https lmb. After a very long break from Kaggle I have returned and decided to share what I am currently working on. Of particular interest here is the rescale argument which will allow us to transform our images to a form that is recognizable by our model Generate training data Using the above arguments we generate our train data. The above tells us that we have generated 60 fake images. For convenience we shall c hange d irectory into our newly cloned repository. You can alternatively use dice coeffiecient jaccard similarity mean IOU and so on as you may wish or as theory may allow. Despite its importance microscopy tasks are often time consuming and require years of expert experience to not only obtain datasets but also perform such tasks as classifying normal vs diseased samples or simply counting the number of cells in an image. Notebook Aims Image data is an integral part of the biomedical research indsutry especially in experiments that aim to image different stages of the cell or organisms. Thank you very much for reading. We also generate fake data which we save to aug to use this as our test data. Here we use binary cross entropy and accuracy as our loss function and metric respectively. It is defined in this notebook and will be committed to cytounet later. In training our model most of these hyperparameters are randomly chosen. We also use Adam as our default optimizer. It should be noted that depsite its relative implementation simplicity deep learning still has some flaws and limitations that we discusss at the end of this notebook. For our purposes it is especially important to know the file format of our images. It is also a useful idea to l ist files in our directory to simply confirm that it in fact is not empty. You can also use this as your validation dataset and feed it to generate_validation_data. This is one of the limitations of deep and machine learning in my opinion. com Nelson Gon cytounet. You can play around with different non biological datasets and judge for yourself how well it works. Please try it out and let me know what your results are. Image Transformations First we need to define a dictionary to define what kind of transformations will be used in our processing functions generate_ _data which generate augmented images that are then fed to our model on each epoch. This section moves our images to target directories it should be run to generate our test data. With that short intro let us dive right into the code. For convenience we import everything from these modules. ConclusionThis has been a very brief example of what the unet algorithm could do and how this could be harnessed for biological datasets. As always please let me know what could be improved. What s new in this version of the notebook I have added text to the notebook. Thank you for reading and hope you like it. Introducing cytounet To simplify image segmentation I have written up a small deep learning based Keras Tensorflow python package cytounet https github. The name cytounet reflects the fact that this is an implementation of the Unet algorithm for biological data cyto. Importing relevant modules Within cytounet are a few functions that will be useful for our pipeline. For this task we are going to generate image labels masks for embryonic images from the Broad Institute https data. This does not mean that it is limited to biological data. What does our data look like It is often important to understand what our data looks like. One could use SGD instead. We could overcome this by using regularizers such as L1 and L2 which use the absolute weights and sum square of the weights for the penalty respectively. define a novel algorithm that does the same with similar or better results. This can also be useful if you need to synthesize data to escape the curse of small datasets which apparently do not work well for deep learning methods. Another solution is to use a simpler model and build on this to see how model complexity affects the model s output. Predict on our generated dataFinally we predict on our generated fake data and see how well our model does. de people ronneber u net. From imaging embryonic events to histopathological imaging microscopy is extremely important. One could perform a hyperparameter grid search but at the time of writing this is not yet implemented in this package. For future steps as described previously one could try to test this model on non biological data determine the effect of kernel regularization on predicted values determine if dropout is a better approach than batch normalization that this model uses.
