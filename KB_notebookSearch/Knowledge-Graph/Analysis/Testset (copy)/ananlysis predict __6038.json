Sample_Submission. Training Image AnalysisWidth and Height DistributionThe training images do not have consistent dimensions. What is Glomerulus First we understand what Nephron is. Paitient Data HuBMAP 20 dataset_information. com kwk100 hubmap exploratory data analysis edahttps www. The resulting aldehydes react with the Schiff reagent to produce the purple magenta color exhibited by these images. The annotations denote segmentations of glomeruli. FTU Functional Tissue Unit FTU or functional tissue unit is a three dimensional maximally connected block of cells centered around a capillary such that each cell in this block is within diffusion distance from any other cell in the same block. The training set has 8 files. Utility Functions Processing Directory Contents Training Images Test Images Train CSV The masks indicating a glomeruli FTUs are stored in rle format in the train. csv is in Running Length Encoding format. The train set includes annotations in both RLE encoded RLE is explained later in the notebook and unencoded JSON forms. For this we have to train a segmentation model that takes PAS kidney image input and identify the segments of glomeruli FTU in the PAS stained microscopy data. It is composed of a renal corpuscle and a renal tubule. The private test set is larger than the public test set. So to specify 10 pixels starting from pixel number 200 would be written as 200 10Evaluation MetricDice CoefficientDice coefficient is a statistical tool which measures the similarity between two sets of data. csv The sample_submission. The renal corpuscle consists of a tuft of capillaries called a glomerulus and an encompassing Bowman s capsule. The nephron is the microscopic structural and functional unit of the kidney. Both training and public test sets include anatomical structure segmentations. It s a measure of similarity for the two sets of data with a range from 0 to 100. ndim 2 mask np. RLEThe masks provided in the train. This encoding comes in pairs of pixel values as follows 1. Number of pixels from the starting pixel. JSON files are structured as follows A type Feature and object type id PathAnnotationObject. Although it s easy to interpret it is extremely sensitive to small samples sizes and may give erroneous results especially with very small samples or data sets with missing observations. This index has become arguably the most broadly used tool in the validation of image segmentation algorithms created with AI but it is a much more general concept which can be applied sets of data for a variety of applications including NLP. This has to be corrected when loading the images. PAS Periodic acid Schiff Stain MicroscopyPAS is a histology stain that detects complex sugars in tissue sections. The formula to find the Index is Jaccard Index the number in both sets the number in either set 100Relation between Dice Coefficient and Jaccard ScoreJ D 2 DLet s do the EDA now File StructureThe files in the root of the dataset are shown below. com roydatascience hubmap sub effunet5 tpu efficientunet 512x512 Libraries Number of glomeruli to display for each image Number of glomberuli to save as tiff files. The IsLocked field is the same across file types locked in glomerulus unlocked for anatomical structure and is not signal bearing. The higher the percentage the more similar the two populations. I suppose there will be 7 files. Glomerulus a cluster of nerve endings spores or small blood vessels in particular a cluster of capillaries around the end of a kidney tubule where waste products are filtered from the blood. The Dice coefficient can be used to compare the pixel wise agreement between a predicted segmentation and its corresponding ground truth. csv contains additional information about each image such as image size and anonymized patient data. Periodic acid is used to break specific bonds within these sugars. Glomeruli can be observed as the circular areas of dark stain. The public test set has 5 files. A geometry containing a Polygon with coordinates for the feature s enclosing volume Additional properties including the name and color of the feature in the image. TIFF is a flexible adaptable file format for handling images and data within a single file by including the header tags size definition image data arrangement applied image compression defining the image s geometry. I believe I used some terminologies that are confusing. In short each nephron in your kidneys has a microscopic filter called a glomerulus that is constantly filtering your blood. For this task we are given historical images of kidney and annotation information representing the glomerular segmentation. Jaccard ScoreThe Jaccard similarity index sometimes called the Jaccard similarity coefficient compares members for two sets to see which members are shared and which are distinct. So lets understand these terms and get some Domain Knowledge. expand_dims mask 1 Plot full image Plot glomeruli images. HuBMAP Hacking the KidneyLet s understand the problem statement firstThe aim of this competition is to develop a segmentation problem to identify Glomerulus in the kidney. Let s understand the DATA now The Dataset is comprised of very large TIFF files TIFF is described later in the notebook. Note that these fields are the same between all files and do not offer signal. TIFF File FormatTag Image File Format abbreviated TIFF or TIF is a computer file format for storing raster graphics images popular among graphic artists the publishing industry and photographers. I suppose this can be used for pretraining.

The dataset consists of 2 directories that contain training and test images and 3 csv files with additional information about the images.
