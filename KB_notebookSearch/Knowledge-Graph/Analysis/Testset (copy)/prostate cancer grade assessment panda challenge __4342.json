Recent research including two studies independently conducted by the groups hosting this challenge have shown that these systems can achieve pathologist level performance. About Notebook Compitetion Prostate cANcer graDe Assessment PANDA Challenge Prostate cancer diagnosis using the Gleason grading system About CompetetionWith more than 1 million new diagnoses reported every year prostate cancer PCa is the second most common cancer among males worldwide that results in more than 350 000 deaths annually. These tissue samples are examined by a pathologist and scored according to the Gleason grading system. Diagnosis of PCa is based on the grading of prostate tissue biopsies. Radboud University Medical Center and Karolinska Institute have teamed up to organize this competition in collaboration with colleagues from Tampere University. images 255 images mode 0 mode 2. However these systems results were not tested with multi center datasets at scale. Furthermore in contrast to previous challenges we are making full diagnostic biopsy images available. However the system suffers from significant inter observer variability between pathologists limiting its usefulness for individual patients. The grading process consists of finding and classifying cancer tissue into so called Gleason patterns 3 4 or 5 based on the architectural growth patterns of the tumor Fig. Challenge organizer team Wouter Bulten Geert Litjens Hans Pinckaers Peter Str\u00f6m Martin Eklund Lars Egevad Henrik Gr\u00f6nberg Kimmo Kartasalo Pekka Ruusuvuori Tomi H\u00e4kkinen Sohier Dane Maggie Demkin. png SponsorsThe PANDA workshop at MICCAI 2020 is sponsored by ContextVision Ibex and Google. Automated deep learning systems have shown some promise in accurately grading PCa.

After the biopsy is assigned a Gleason score it is converted into an ISUP grade on a 1 5 scale. The Gleason grading system is the most important prognostic marker for PCa and the ISUP grade has a crucial role when deciding how a patient should be treated. There is both a risk of missing cancers and a large risk of overgrading resulting in unnecessary treatment. Your work here will improve on these efforts using the most extensive multi center dataset on Gleason grading yet. The most common blue outline Gleason pattern 3 and second most common red outline Gleason pattern 4 cancer growth patterns present in the biopsy dictate the Gleason score 3 4 for this biopsy which in turn is converted into an ISUP grade 2 for this biopsy following guidelines of the International Society of Urological Pathology. png attachment image. The key to decreasing mortality is developing more precise diagnostics. The training set consists of around 11 000 whole slide images of digitized H E stained biopsies originating from two centers. Karolinska Institute s Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics MEB includes an interdisciplinary research group to improve the diagnostics and treatment of prostate cancer. Using a sizable multi center test set graded by expert uro pathologists we will evaluate challenge submissions on their applicability to improve this critical diagnostic function. png Figure 1 An illustration of the Gleason grading process for an example biopsy containing prostate cancer. This is the largest public whole slide image dataset available roughly 8 times the size of the CAMELYON17 challenge one of the largest digital pathology datasets and best known challenges in the field. Biopsies not containing cancer are represented by an ISUP grade of 0 in this challenge. In this challenge you will develop models for detecting PCa on images of prostate tissue samples and estimate severity of the disease using the most extensive multi center dataset on Gleason grading yet available. Together they hope to further their existing research to make a significant impact on the healthcare of prostate cancer patients.
