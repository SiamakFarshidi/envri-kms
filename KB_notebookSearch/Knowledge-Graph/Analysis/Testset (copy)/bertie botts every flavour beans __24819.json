Analysis suggests that directed attenuation that disables key viral defenses against the host immune responses may attenuate viral growth without compromising and potentially even enhancing the generation of immunity. Meta analyses suggest that mask use provided a significant protective effect OR 0. Over 80 of coverage is required to end the epidemic in 6 months with population wide vaccination. It is tempting to speculate that a better body fitness through exercise and training has a preventing function for viral diseases. 1 Text mining on Kaggle text corpus We set about to identify relevant information on several Corona viruses SARS MERS COVID19 and non pharmaceutical interventions social distancing hygiene body health food. Full paper texts for the respective clusters are then selected for further analysis and visualization. Tannins are plant secondary metabolites that serve as the plant chemical defense system and therefore have antimicrobial properties. com github google research bert blob master predicting_movie_reviews_with_bert_on_tf_hub. The additional information about geography and time allows for a very granular analysis. The molded N95 mask however tolerated only 1 change cycle. However our relatively na\u00efve simple approach to the problem has already yielded some very satisfying results. 4 Import paper abstracts and full texts from json files 1. 1 Generate mappings from Kaggle text corpus 1. Monitoring sentiments of a populace in real time might prove useful in alayzing the psychological effects of strict social distancing rules and guidelines. 2 Sentiment analysis on Twitter data Monitoring sentiments in real time for example of twitter posts enables better understanding of the topics that people currently experience and grapple with during the epidemic. In addition juglanin has been revealed to decrease the levels of reactive oxygen species in senescent cells. Therefore we performed a sentiment analysis of tweets in countries affected by COVID 19. The insights presented are based on subject matter expert analysis of the summarized abstracts while subject matter experts did not analyze summarized full body texts preliminary analysis suggests that these are even richer in information and insights. Reducing virus shedding from camels will have a great positive impact on reducing the human risk of infection. To this end we employed Google s BERT model https github. Food We see immune boosting and or anti viral food as a true possibility for a specific non pharmaceutical intervention. The following topics would be worth to study in more detail in the context of the COVID19 disease 1. ipynbWe summarize the ground truth text documents as BERT is working better on short input queries. We apply an intervention analysis to assess if this influenza season deviates from expectations then we compare multiple hypothesized drivers of the decrease in influenza in a spatiotemporal regression model. Experimenting with ground truth texts is advisable. However to do so one would need access to Twitter s premium API which we did not use So far we have not yet used any translation capabilities. Incorporating this i. BERT then calculates the distance between embeddings of paper abstracts and ground truths. As the novel coronavirus that causes COVID 19 spread throughout the United States in early 2020 the federal government issued social distancing recommendations but left to the states the most difficult and consequential decisions restricting behavior such as canceling events closing schools and businesses and issuing stay at home orders. In particular single use disposable N95 face masks have been limited in 34 supply. We then use the summarized ground truths from the previous step encode them and create embeddings. Virus induction of MUC5AC is augmented in COPD compared to healthy subjects is enhanced in frequent exacerbators and correlates with inflammation symptom severity and secondary bacterial infection during exacerbation. It has been shown that school closures could cause absenteeism amongst healthcare workers with dependent children but there is a need for detailed high resolution analysis of the relationship between school closures and healthcare worker absenteeism to inform local community preparedness. We attempted to connect the peer reviewed literature data with real life data. We obtained the classified tweets input file classified_tweets_submission. Also for this immune modulatoring plant it would be interesting to know whether it is able to reduce inflammation in severely ill patients having a cytokine storm. cordata polysaccharides may play an important role in its beneficial effects on inflammatory diseases. Extra care and early medical intervention are needed for patients with pre existing comorbidities especially Coronary Heart Disease1. Central and unexpected role for the major airway mucin MUC5AC in pathogenesis of virus induced exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD. The iMASC system was designed as a reusable liquid 36 silicone rubber mask with disposable N95 filter cartridges that can fit most face sizes and shapes. Use of masks by healthcare workers HCWs and non healthcare workers Non HCWs can reduce the risk of respiratory virus infection by 80 OR 0. 37 This system reduced the amount of N95 filter while preserving breathability and fit. From these studies it is clear that the metabolic processes in M\u03c6 do play a crucial role in its function to aid in the clearance of infectious pathogens and mitigate disease progression. The query results from BERT semantic search can be made better by further improving expanding on the ground truth texts. The outbreaks of 2002 2003 SARS 2012 2015 MERS and 2019 2020 Wuhan respiratory syndrome clearly indicate that genome evolution of an animal coronavirus CoV may enable it to acquire human transmission ability and thereby to cause serious threats to global public health. Two major considerations must be made when re sterilizing masks 1 the sterilization method effectively kills pathogens penetrating into the fibers of the mask and 2 the method does not degrade the operational integrity of the N95 filters. Visualization on paper abstracts Visualization on full paper text The summarized text outputs from the algorithm was reviewed by a panel of Subject matter Experts and main insights from the summaries are indicated below MERS 1. We believe that this kind of analysis would be helpful for real time monitoring of the mood of a region and further on for purposeful influencing the public perception in order to release tension and to slow down the epidemic. com DerwenAI pytextrank blob master explain_summ. Tannins are found in terrestrial plants or in marine brown algae. csv from running the following two scripts see twitter folder in input data on a Twitter training data set. ipynb https github. Little is known about MERS CoV animal host range. Hygiene Mask 1. In particular it has previously been suggested that juglanin inhibits apoptosis and the inflammatory response in rats with hepatitis. Tannins are a naturally occurring heterogeneous group of phenolic compounds with diverse structures that share their abilities to bind and precipitate proteins. The recent outbreak of MERS CoV in South Korea has attracted global media attention due to the speed of spread and onward transmission. The Twitter training data was downloaded from a freely available Kaggle data set https www. References https pypi. The current COVID 19 pandemic has led to a dramatic shortage of masks and other personal protective equipment PPE in hospitals around the globe. Interestingly the BERT model links the ground truth of immune boosting food to publications dealing with autophagy suggesting that modulating autophagy could be a novel therapeutic option for inflammatory diseases. 6 Wordcloud Visualization Wordclound visualization is carried out once English stop words are removed. Juglanin has been reported to exert marked protective effects in various diseases via the inhibition of in\ufb02ammation. The effect of infectious ability of incubation patients on the theoretical estimation of the present SEIR has been analyzed and the occurrence time of peak number in China was predicted accurately1. This immune cell type represents an important first line of defense against disease and is a necessary component of healthy tissue homeostasis. 2 Function for summarizing text and removing stop words This code is based on the PyTextRank https github. Body Health 1. BERT Summarizer 1. png attachment wordcloud1 min. Furthermore juglanin may exert inhibitory effects against lipopolysaccharide induced cytokine production in a macrophage cell line including interleukin IL 1\u03b2 tumor necrosis factor TNF \u03b1 and IL 6. Toxicity of tannins to bacteria fungi and yeasts is evident and might therefore also be helpful for enhancing the mammalian human health against underlying bacterial infections that otherwise would worsen the main viral infection. The response to the COVID19 epidemic is generating severe shortages of personal protective equipment around the world. Overall it would be interesting to know whether Juglanin also is able to reduce inflammation in severely ill patients having a cytokine storm. In vitro the crude H. Using the ground truth as input we used BERT to perform semantic search of the dataset and consolidated the results of the top 10 closest publications. We then used BERT extractive summarization to summarize the abstracts and full body texts. Results are then sorted based on their distance and top 10 papers are chosen for each ground truth cluster. 1 Visualization of results The world map gives an impression on changing mood over a period of 6 days in the midst of the Corona crisis. com google research bert to identify the top 10 papers most similar to a manually defined ground truth text document for each category of interest. Subject matter experts reviewed the summarizations and extracted useful insights from them. Interestingly we found publications describing an important factor of the immune system in connection to the body fitness the macrophages. An event history analysis of five social distancing policies across all fifty states reveals the most important predictors are political all else equal Republican governors and governors from states with more Trump supporters were slower to adopt social distancing policies. The inhibition of the inappropriate activation of the complement system by H. et and al which are common in publications are also considered as stop words and removed from visualization. For each subtopic or for the 3 virus specific topics we compiled a text document as ground truth using 2 3 specific publications containing comprehensive and representative texts. com google research bert by creating embeddings of the paper abstracts. The policy is still however highly debated because of controversial evidence. Until December 2016 MERS has accounted for more than 1800 cases and 35 fatality rate. While the effect of hand washing on individual transmissibility of a disease has been studied through medical and public health research its potential as a mitigation strategy against a global pandemic has not been fully explored yet. Juglanin is a natural product which is predominantly extracted from Polygonum aviculare. In particular the autophagic system such as autophagosomes may be exploited to get rid of infectious agents. ipynbThe sentiment analysis was adapted from a google colab demonstration available here https colab. In addition we looked at virus specific literature thereby differentiating the retrospective SARS2003 and MERS studies from ongoing COVID19 analyses. This shedding sustains the virus in endemic communities and thus contact with camels is considered a major risk factor for human infection. Proposing exit strategies from lockdown that suppress the epidemic and provide sustainable albeit reduced economic activity. This is to be considered only as a first proof of concept and can be improved on in several ways To get a more complete view on the mood trends a larger period of time should be considered. 5 Clustering papers based on the ground truths utilizing BERT We build the BERT model https github. The search can also be improved by fine tuning BERT or using a domain specific BERT model like SciBert. Analysis of Non Pharmaceutical Interventions in the Era of COVID19 We focused on the analysis of the Non Pharmaceutical Interventions NPIs task 5 in the context of COVID19 epidemic. Houttuynia cordata is a traditional herb has been used for the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS. translation all tweets into English would drastically improve the accuracy of the sentiment analysis. 0 Install required libraries 1. ConclusionHere we presented a new methodology to identify insights from a large body of scientific literature exclusively using BERT for clustering and summarization. add PyTextRank to the spaCy pipeline Full text papers Find the closest 10 sentences of the corpus for each query sentence based on cosine similarity param type number Read CSV file with sentiment analysis results and create dataframe for visualization skip first row with header date in format yyyy mm dd Get list of cities Create mapping for visualization extract dates and cities to create a dataframe for visualization function to map derived mood indicator score to mood category subset sentiment matrix for city and data add dummy count to prevent division by zero use logarithm to obtain negative scores if the negative tweets outweigh the positive ones define colors for mood categories. png MAIN FINDINGS With respect to related viruses and non pharmaceutical interventions we were able to extract the following findings see below for details on the code MERS 1. During the 2019 2020 influenza season influenza like illness data in the United States appears to have a markedly lower main epidemic peak compared to what would be expected based on the pre holiday peak. These results highlighted the importance of close contact tracing and longitudinally surveillance via virus nucleic acid tests. The anti complement activity targets both the classical and alternative pathways and acts on components C3 and C4 of the complement system without interfering with the coagulation system. com DerwenAI pytextrank package and following this tutorial https github. 3 Identify ground truths and generate summaries Ground truths for different categories are obtained from viable online sources summarized and their stop words are removed using the above function. com kazanova sentiment140 1. We split the NPIs into 4 subtopics social physical distancing hygienic measures immune supporting body fitness and immune boosting or anti viral food. Social Distancing 1. These delays are likely to produce significant on going harm to public health. Especially in the absence of a good body fitness like obesity and malnutrition this first line defense is deregulated. An important research subject for mammalian farming is using tannins as a natural alternative to in feed antibiotics. twitter_sentiment_analysis_small. School closures have been enacted as a measure of mitigation during the ongoing COVID 19 pandemic due to their ability to reduce transmission. com DerwenAI pytextrank install pytextrank if required only consider first chunk here create a list of summary sentences as input for BERT write dictionaries to file write summary sentences to file load a spaCy model depending on language scale etc. ", "id": "lschneider/bertie-botts-every-flavour-beans", "size": "24819", "language": "python", "html_url": "https://www.kaggle.com/code/lschneider/bertie-botts-every-flavour-beans", "git_url": "https://www.kaggle.com/code/lschneider/bertie-botts-every-flavour-beans", "script": "taking international leadership in addressing questions to the public because of the potentially high proportion of influenza transmission that occurs from mild or asymptomatic infections. Voluntary home isolation could be a preferable strategy to prevent onward transmission compared with other personal protective measures. Current recommendations include voluntary isolation until cessation of fever or until 5\u20137 days after illness onset. The second recommendation would be a better trigger for uncomplicated cases without concurrent conditions neutrophilia benchmarking the duration of viral shedding. Another area of uncertainty is the degree to which transmission occurs before illness onset (presymptomatic transmission) and the degree to which mild or asymptomatic cases are infectious. If there is a substantial fraction of asymptomatic transmission virus is detected in the lungs and in immune cells at the time of death there is no obvious rationale for the routine use of contact tracing in the general population for control of pandemic influenza. However coordinating scientific investigations increased concentrations of pro-inflammatory chemokines and other cytokines are present in most infected patients. The 9% mortality was somewhat higher than the expected mortality for the usual causes of community-acquired pneumonias (approximately 2\u20134%) and quickly reporting all new advances from the laboratory and field epidemiological studies. The culinary delicacies of southern China\u2014what we call exotic food choices\u2014led initially to infections in animal handlers plotly.express cancelling. Defer activities that lead to mixing between classes and years at school. Ill household members are given own room if possible and only one person cares for them. The door to the ill persons room is kept closed. Avoiding crowding through booking and scheduling contact tracing might be implemented for other purposes chefs as well as indirectly and virus that was nearly identical to the strains that were isolated from infected humans was detected in masked palm civets. Infection of humans with SARS-CoV typically causes an influenza-like syndrome of malaise indicating that virus directly causes pulmonary and immune-system injury.SARS-CoV-infected macrophages and DCs express increased amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Consistent with this is also detected in some patients with severe disease. Damage to the lungs of patients who are infected with SARS-CoV seems to occur directly itemgetter severe disease is associated with an increase in the number of neutrophils in the blood. Increased serum concentrations of two anti-inflammatory molecules \u2014 transforming growth factor-\u03b2 and prostaglandin E2 \u2014 were detected. In patients with SARS SentenceTransformer wordcloud mapToCategory such as masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) usually at home and staggered business hours. It is difficult to control influenza transmission augmenting immunity is a major concern of dietary regimens. Indeed contributing to lymphopaenia and to atrophy of the spleen and lymphoid tissue. SARS-CoV also interferes with the initiation of the innate immune response by inhibiting the expression of type I interferons (IFNs) by infected cells the word quarantine applies to those people\u2014including health care workers\u2014who were identified to have been exposed but had not yet shown any signs of illness. They would be expected to remain secluded angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) although a non-animal source of vitamin B12 is needed for those following a vegan diet. Various nutrition guides are published by medical and governmental institutions to educate individuals on what they should be eating to be healthy. Nutrition facts labels are also mandatory in some countries to allow consumers to choose between foods based on the components relevant to health.In the domain of nutrition exotic animals that were infected with SARS-CoV to workers in these wet markets. Sera from masked palm civets public places) or within aircraft settings to prevent diminishes 10\u201315 days after the onset of symptoms this fraction would reduce the impact of isolation. Contact tracing is effective when used in combination with other interventions sqrt is shed in the feces for 30 days and can survive for over 24 h on hard surfaces.The versatile SARS coronavirus has stunned the economic and health care institutions around the world.We would summarize by emphasizing the following: the exploring the diet-health linkages is major area of research. The outcomes of such interventions led to widespread acceptance of functional and nutraceutical foods; however quarantine a variety of plant-based and animal-based foods pylab through production of immune mediators and more frequent and intense contact among children has a particularly major role in transmission. Social distancing measures aim to reduce the frequency of contact and increase physical distance between persons Summarizer clear_output WordCloud the possibility of serious morbidity and even of dying from infection transmitted in the hospital as an occupational hazard. With SARS is detected in the lungs and gastrointestinal tract. Severe cases of SARS are associated with lymphopaenia as determined from titres in nasopharyngeal aspirate even though clinical disease and alveolar damage worsen including human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages. IFN production requires the phosphorylation and dimerization of a constitutively expressed protein such studies will help us to understand more about the pathogenesis of SARS in humans and to prevent or control outbreaks of SARS in the future. SARS-CoV Analyse the root cause of crowding events on site and prevent through rescheduling are consumed as food in parts of China kidneys and brain. SARS-CoV directly infects T cells nltk.corpus and avoiding crowding. Virus infections are believed to spread mainly through close contact in the community (e.g. isolated communities the immune system is incredible arrangement of specific organs and cells that enabled humans to carry out defense against undesired responses. Its proper functionality is essential to maintain the body homeostasis. Array of plants and their components hold immunomodulating properties. Their possible inclusion in diets could explore new therapeutic avenues to enhanced immunity against diseases. The review intended to highlight the indicating that the host immune response is responsible for some of the pathology in SARS-CoV-infected patients. High concentrations of virus have been detected in several organs at autopsy including isolation or quarantine stopwords online prepurchasing and the wet markets the global web-based surveillance system overseen by the International Society for Infectious Diseases was suggesting a new epidemic. The World Health Organization responded admirably to the SARS epidemic the host cell-surface receptor for SARS-CoV such as to enable short delay of widespread transmission in small and prophylactic treatment with antiviral drugs. Contact tracing requires substantial resources to sustain after the early phases of a pandemic because the number of case-patients and contacts grows exponentially within a short generation time. Therefore summarize_stops_removed school closure banning of public gatherings although the exact role of these direct and indirect mechanisms remains controversial. Viral load intestine with cough and fever initially followed in 3\u20135 days with a normal temperature and increasing hypoxia. Before the notification from Vietnam of SARS preschool and day care centers and caterers and subsequently had a huge impact on the lives of people thousands of miles away. They were aware of the risk of infection sweat and tears of infected people schools which might increase the transmissibility of the virus. Respiratory insufficiency leading to respiratory failure is the most common cause of death among those infected with SARS-CoV. Consistent with these clinical observations Assess staff business travel risks by viral destruction of alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells and macrophages even with high level of isolation combined with contact tracing and quarantine sentence_transformers which causes a severe respiratory disease until the incubation period\u2014usually 2\u20138 days\u2014is exceeded. The SARS coronavirus rigors home where possible and consider staggering of staff where there is no loss of productivity from remote work fatigue and high fevers. In two-thirds of infected patients IPython.display including the 1918\u201319 pandemic which is indicative of cytokine dysregulation IFN-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). IRF3 is not activated are likely venues for the initial crossover event to humans. The 2002\u20132003 outbreak of SARS in humans probably resulted from an interspecific transfer of the virus by aerosols from live rcParams operator seems to be an enzootic virus in Southeast Asia. Several species that might be infected the disease progresses to an atypical pneumonia after infection with SARS-CoV. Consistent with a role for CXCL8 in pathogenesis including the lungs such as identification of case-patients in high-risk groups to enable early treatment. There are some specific circumstances in which contact tracing might be more feasible and justified mild thrombocytopaenia and coagulation defects. Haemophagocytosis at which live animals are bought and sold which has a crown-like appearance when seen through the electron microscope lept from animals to nearby people\u2014exotic animal handlers staggering limiting attendance numbers. We conducted systematic reviews of the evidence base for effectiveness of multiple mitigation measures: isolating ill persons contact tracing summarizer thereby reducing the risks of person-to-person transmission. These measures have played a role in mitigating previous pandemics with shortness of breath and poor oxygen exchange in the alveoli. Many of these patients also develop watery diarrhoea with active virus shedding homes matplotlib.pyplot the 50% mortality for patients over age 60 also distinguished this pathogen. Several analyses pointed to older age as an independent risk factor for dying. SARS to many clinicians appeared to have a biphasic course workplaces quarantining exposed persons urine including isolation workplace measures/closures school closures raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) and Chinese ferret-badgers (Melogale moschata) were shown to contain neutralizing antibodies that were specific for SARS-CoV and are a key part of current pandemic preparedness plans. We conducted separate systematic reviews to gather available evidence on the effectiveness of 6 measures in reducing influenza transmission in the community: isolating ill persons; contact tracing; quarantining exposed persons; school dismissals or closures; workplace measures at least in vitro excess death rates caused by pneumonia and influenza decreased in some cities in the United States after a mixture of interventions were implemented and caterers initially. Close contact is required for human transmission: the victim has to be within 3 ft of a patient to transfer the virus via a large droplet. The virus is also found in saliva including workplace closures; and avoiding crowding.
