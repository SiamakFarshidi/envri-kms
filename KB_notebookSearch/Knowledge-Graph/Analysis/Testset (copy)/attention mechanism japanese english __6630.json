Finally let s test the model on some of the quotes from Japanese manga Naruto. A decoder network then used this internal representation to output words until the end of sequence token was reached. Scoring is performed using a function a. The Japanese sentences tend to have a longer word length than the English sentences. filterwarnings ignore message Glyph d missing from current font. Let s get started straight away Data preprocessing Let s do some analysis on the sentence lengths. Given a problem of generating an output text sequence from input text sequence Ex. Let s test the model on some random datapoints from the test data and check the attention scores. com calculate bleu score for text python I ll be calculating the BLEU score in 1000 random datapoints from test data. Calculation and applying gradient descent on the trainable parameters of the model https www. Padding the tokenized data splitting data into train and test concat method as content based function expanding layer dimension for compatibility with encoder_output tensor calculating score calculating attention_weights calculating context_vector preparing context vector to make it compatible with target_embedd concatenating context vector and target_embeddings getting result from lstm Making the output compatible for dense layer for vocab representation getting vocab size output mask to elemenate the loss due values https machinelearningmastery. The heatmap of attention scores tell us how the words in the input Japanese sentence and the predicted English sentence are related. Find the original paper here https arxiv. Encoding The input sentence is first encoded as a single fixed length vector. The alignment model scores e how well each encoded input h matches the current output of the decoder s. Encoder Decoder model encoder decoder image https queirozf. 03762 Remember in the step 2 Score calculation the scoring is performed using a function. 53 which is pretty good. Decoding Decoding is then performed as per the Encoder Decoder model although in this case using the attended context vector for the current time step. asks Orochimaru. reference 1 https machinelearningmastery. General method for score calculation. If no sentence is passed it picks a random sentence from Japanese test data a random number a random sentence sequence from the input language converting the input sequence into text printing the input text sequence a random sentence sequence from the output language converting the output sequence into text printing the output text sequence converting the input sequence into text printing the input text sequence preparing input for attention model initializing the input as a tensor initializing the hidden layers all zeros decoder initial input as all translating sentence model. It was proposed as a solution to the limitation of the Encoder Decoder model encoding the input sequence to one fixed length internal representation from which to decode each output time step. The decoder outputs one value at a time which is passed on to perhaps more layers before finally outputting a prediction y for the current output time step. reading data from file removing attribution For tokenizing the Japanese sentences preprocessing the sentences by stripping and adding initializing tokenizer To convert the words into numerical representation fitting on english fitting on japanese defining the vocabulary size of english and japanese language in the given data. gif As with the Encoder Decoder paper the technique is applied to a machine translation problem and uses GRU units rather than LSTM memory cells. bleu score encoder decoder https 3qeqpr26caki16dnhd19sv6by6v wpengine. An Encoder Decoder architecture was developed where an input sequence was read in entirety and encoded to a fixed length internal representation. Annotation weights calculation Next the alignment scores are normalized using a softmax function. Defining the encoder and decoder models Defining the loss function BLEU score function Function for plotting the heatmap of Annotation weights Gradient calculation and update Creating Attention model Defining some more parameters and training the model It took around 100 mins to train the model on around 52k sentences and the BLEU score so far is 0. The model seems to perform pretty good on short sentences but seems lost while translating long sentences probably because of the small dataset. save_weights jpn_to_eng. But in this project I ll be using LSTM memory cells. com a 27134600 4084039 function for translating the input japanese sentence to english and plotting the annotation attention scores. The key benefits of the approach are the ability to train a single end to end model directly on source and target sentences and the ability to handle variable length input and output sequences of text. When scoring the very first output for the decoder this will be 0. converting a Japanese sentence to English let s quickly go through the working of a encoder decoder model step by step 1. This issue was believed to be more of a problem when decoding long sequences. These normalized scores are called annotation weights. Context vector calculation Next each annotation h is multiplied by the annotation weights a to produce a new attended context vector from which the current output time step can be decoded. It works fairly well but without attention the performance drops as the length of the sentences increase. png Attention model Attention is a mechanism that was developed to improve the performance of the Encoder Decoder RNN on machine translation. png The Encoder Decoder architecture with recurrent neural networks has become an effective and standard approach for both neural machine translation NMT and sequence to sequence seq2seq prediction in general. Translating Japanese text to English using attention enabled Encoder Decoder model. attention gif https labs. com how does attention work in encoder decoder recurrent neural networks How do Attention models work Since the attention models are encoder decoder models with attention mechanism they function very similar to encoder decoder models but with a catch. Score calculation The encoded input sentence flows through the encoder and decoder. The calculation of the score requires the output from the decoder from the previous output time step e. The normalization of the scores allows them to be treated like probabilities indicating the likelihood of each encoded input time step annotation being relevant to the current output time step. defining the max length of english and japanese sentence in the given data for padding. LSTM networks were used for both the encoder and decoder. Instead of encoding the input sequence into a single fixed context vector the attention model develops a context vector that is filtered specifically for each output time step. I ll also use the other scoring functions and see which one works the best. says Naruto Finally a long dialogue by Itachi. What is Attention mechanism Before understanding the attention mechanism first let s take a quick look at Encoder Decoder architecture. com images contents ZZqXAUp. com wp content uploads 2017 10 Loss in model skill with increased sentence length. com wp content uploads 2019 06 image5. com encoder decoder recurrent neural network models neural machine translation reference 2 https machinelearningmastery. In the future version I ll improve the performance of this model by adding more data and by some fine tuning. Thanks for reading hope the notebook was useful Comments and feedbacks are most welcomed Stay strong Keep on learning \u3055\u3088\u3046\u306a\u3089 installing japanese font Importing the necessary libraries. Now there are many scoring functions out there but in this project I ll be using general method for score calculation.
