Why are you trying it This notebook can either train a new model or load a previously trained model. This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed It is defined by the kaggle python Docker image https github. input directory For example running this by clicking run or pressing Shift Enter will list all files under the input directory You can write up to 20GB to the current directory kaggle working that gets preserved as output when you create a version using Save Run All You can also write temporary files to kaggle temp but they won t be saved outside of the current session DECLARE HOW MANY GPUS YOU WISH TO USE. 5 the prediction is a match and considered a true positive. Get numbers of each type calc microf1 VALID DATAFRAME if df. However less than a third of high school seniors are proficient writers according to the National Assessment of Educational Progress. com kaggle docker python For example here s several helpful packages to load linear algebra data processing CSV file I O e. KAGGLE ONLY HAS 1 BUT OFFLINE YOU CAN USE MORE 0 1 2 3 for four gpu VERSION FOR SAVING LOADING MODEL WEIGHTS THIS SHOULD MATCH THE MODEL IN LOAD_MODEL_FROM IF VARIABLE IS NONE THEN NOTEBOOK COMPUTES TOKENS OTHERWISE NOTEBOOK LOADS TOKENS FROM PATH IF VARIABLE IS NONE THEN NOTEBOOK TRAINS A NEW MODEL OTHERWISE IT LOADS YOUR PREVIOUSLY TRAINED MODEL IF FOLLOWING IS NONE THEN NOTEBOOK USES INTERNET AND DOWNLOADS HUGGINGFACE CONFIG TOKENIZER AND MODEL USE MULTIPLE GPUS THE TOKENS AND ATTENTION ARRAYS THE 14 CLASSES FOR NER HELPER VARIABLES WE ASSUME DATAFRAME IS ASCENDING WHICH IT IS FOR LOOP THROUGH EACH TRAIN TEXT READ TRAIN TEXT TOKENIZE AND SAVE IN TOKEN ARRAYS FIND TARGETS IN TEXT AND SAVE IN TARGET ARRAYS LEARNING RATE SCHEDULE AND MODEL CHECKPOINT LEARNING RATE SCHEDULE AND MODEL CHECKPOINT TRAIN VALID SPLIT 90 10 LOAD MODEL OR TRAIN MODEL tf. What else do you think you can try as part of this approach Writing is a critical skill for success. Furthermore this notebook is one fold. We can convert this notebook to K fold or train with 100 data for boost in LB. If you guys don t understand the thing that I ll do in this notebook then please comment on this notebook. Currently this notebook uses backbone LongFormer NER formulation one fold What we learned while making this notebook With simple changes we can convert this notebook into Question Answer formulation and we can try different backbones. If multiple matches exist the match with the highest pair of overlaps is taken. epoch 02d val_loss. ModelCheckpoint filepath model. It trains with 90 data and validates on 10 data. Also this notebook can load huggingface stuff like tokenizers from a Kaggle dataset. Any unmatched ground truths are false negatives and any unmatched predictions are false positives. Did it work I ll make it easier for students to receive feedback on their writing and increase opportunities to improve writing outcomes. O MAKE DATAFRAME CODE FROM Rob Mulla robikscube https www. Unfortunately low income Black and Hispanic students fare even worse with less than 15 percent demonstrating writing proficiency. I ve no problem while working on it. What are you trying to do in this notebook This notebook is a TensorFlow starter notebook for Kaggle s Feedback Prize Evaluating Student Writing Competition. read_csv Input data files are available in the read only. com robikscube student writing competition twitch Length of each and intersection Step 1. Furthermore this notebook can either create new NER tokens or load existing tokens. The open sourced algorithms you come up with will allow any educational organization to better help young writers develop. all ground truths and predictions for a given class are compared. 5 and the overlap between the prediction and the ground truth 0. What did you not understand about this process Well everything provides in the competition data page. loc df class key len value GET TEST TEXT IDS CONVERT TEST TEXT TO TOKENS READ TRAIN TEXT TOKENIZE AND SAVE IN TOKEN ARRAYS INFER TEST TEXTS GET TEST PREDICIONS WRITE SUBMISSION CSV. One way to help students improve their writing is via automated feedback tools which evaluate student writing and provide personalized feedback. In this notebook version we will load model and load NER tokens. If the overlap between the ground truth and prediction is 0. h5 SAVE MODEL WEIGHTS if pst start 205 print cur pst start cur pst start GET ID GET TOKEN POSITIONS IN CHARS GET WORD POSITIONS IN CHARS MAPPING FROM TOKENS TO WORDS CONVERT TOKEN PREDICTIONS INTO WORD LABELS 0 LEAD_B 1 LEAD_I 2 POSITION_B 3 POSITION_I 4 EVIDENCE_B 5 EVIDENCE_I 6 CLAIM_B 7 CLAIM_I 8 CONCLUSION_B 9 CONCLUSION_I 10 COUNTERCLAIM_B 11 COUNTERCLAIM_I 12 REBUTTAL_B 13 REBUTTAL_I 14 NOTHING i. In this notebook the improvement comes from set threshold for each class individually to remove Fasle Negative prediction.
