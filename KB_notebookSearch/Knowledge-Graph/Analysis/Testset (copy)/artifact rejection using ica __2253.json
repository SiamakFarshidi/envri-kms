In this experiment checkerboard patterns were presented to the subject into the left and right visual field interspersed by tones to the left or right ear. for eg in the case of EEG if we increase the number of components we are able to see some topo plots being similiar to before. tools stable overview datasets_index. In the case of EEG the EOG and EEG artifacts are activated in all the topo plots even if we increase the number of components in the ICA and PCA due to them being active throughout the experiment When we increase the number of components in the ICA and PCA we are able to see more topo plots and we can decide the artifacts more effectively but more number of components does not mean more accuracy. apply changes the Raw object in place so let s make a copy first Reconstruced after removing artefactual components. Running ICA https mne. We can increase the number of components to cross check out analysis. EEG data from a 60 channel electrode cap was acquired simultaneously with the MEG For first part we are using only EEG data along with EOG and ECG channels recorded The second part has code to work with MEG dataLink to the description https mne. tools stable generated mne. The interval between the stimuli was 750 ms. This is a sample dataset provided by MNE. The subject was asked to press a key with the right index finger as soon as possible after the appearance of the face. Artifact Rejection using ICA In continuation to my previous notebook on introduction to PCA and ICA in EEG. Occasionally a smiley face was presented at the center of the visual field. html sample Plotting the raw data The Vertical is the signal from each electrodes and the horizontal is the timestamp. html Drop artefactual components From the above analysis we can see that the elimination of artifacts from the EEG data there is a significant change in the signal. For this we will be going with MNE package and using their sample dataset. In the above plots we have tweaked the duration and number of electrodes as we can see there is a lot of interference from unwanted sources we will now eliminate these. com tarunchilkur ica for eeg In this notebook we will look at how individual artifacts look in real life and how rejecting them changes our output.
