Training The Model Analysis after Model Training CORRECTLY CLASSIFIED FLOWER IMAGES INCORRECTLY CLASSIFIED FLOWER IMAGES Pls upvote the notebook if you like it. This can be seen in the following animation https cdn images 1. The Network takes an input image and uses a filter or kernel to create a feature map describing the image. This process is repeated all over the image. For each class there are about 800 photos. gif https cdn images 1. You can use this datastet to recognize plants from the photo. For example running this by clicking run or pressing Shift Enter will list all files under the input directory Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output. com max 800 1 VVvdh BUKFh2pwDD0kPeRA 2x. gif This is a 2 D representation of calculations happening in 3 dimensions. png https cdn images 1. The most commonly used one is ReLU. This significantly reduces the training time and preserves significant information. PADDING Padding is just zero value pixels that surround the input image. This protects the loss of any valuable information since the feature map is ever shrinking. Works on CPU and single GPU. The most commonly used one is max pooling which takes the maximum value in the window created by a filter. Moreover the CNN converges faster on 0. read_csv Input data files are available in the. This is what is actually happening Source https cdn images 1. The coresponding numbers in both matrices are multiplied and and added to yield a single number describing that input space. https cdn images 1. Photos are not reduced to a single size they have different proportions image. The pictures are divided into five classes chamomile tulip rose sunflower dandelion. png Loading the Dataset Data Visualization and Preprocessing The dataset seems balanced as for each training label enough training examples exist Randomly Previewing first 10 images We perform a grayscale normalization to reduce the effect of illumination s differences. com max 800 1 vbfPq HvBCkAcZhiSTZybg. png attachment image. Overview of Dataset This dataset contains 4242 images of flowers. com max 800 1 EuSjHyyDRPAQUdKCKLTgIQ. No parameters necessary if TPU_NAME environment variable is set this is always the case on Kaggle. The next step of our process involves further reducing the dimensionality of the data which will lower the computation power required for training this model. png Two of the most commonly associated words with CNN are stride and padding STRIDE Stride just means the amount a filter moves during a covolution operation. Default distribution strategy in Tensorflow. png We use different filters to pass over our inputs and take all the feature maps put them together as the final output of the convolutional layer. This is achieved by using a Pooling Layer. A convolution does this by multiplying two matrices and yielding a third smaller matrix. We then pass the output of this layer through a non linear activation function. com max 800 0 iqNdZWyNeCr5tCkc. It will help me to stay motivated and post more such stuff. Reshaping images to preferred size Normalize the data Reshaping the data from 1 D to 3 D as required through input by CNN s Detect hardware return appropriate distribution strategy TPU detection. now storing some properly as well as misclassified indexes. Photos are not high resolution about 320x240 pixels. In the convolution operation we take a filter usually 2x2 or 3x3 matrix and slide it over the image matrix. So a stride of 1 means that the filter will slide 1 pixel after each covolution operation as shown in this animation. CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS TO THE RESCUEA Convolutional Neural Network is a special type of an Artificial Intelligence implementation which uses a special mathematical matrix manipulation called the convolution operation to process data from the images. Thanks for your time This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed It is defined by the kaggle python docker image https github.
