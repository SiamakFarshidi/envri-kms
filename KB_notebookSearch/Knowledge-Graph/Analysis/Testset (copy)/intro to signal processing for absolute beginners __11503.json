In the example pictured above imagine someone jerking a string up down and back up again. Humans hear frequencies between 20Hz and 20 000Hz. org wikipedia commons thumb 0 0a MorletWaveletMathematica. The unit of frequency is Hertz for example 10 cycles per second 10 Hertz Wavelength measures how far a wave has travelled after 1 period 1 cycle. com media E5nmOMoXoBcnguC format jpg name large A loudspeaker moves a diaphragm back and forth oscillates which pushes the air molecules to follow a similar back and forth movement. The visible light is a small part of that spectrum. It looks like whitening might not be helping though discussion https www. This allows us to analyse and process a signal. Side note if you fancy some more theory check out Nyquist Shannon sampling theorem https en. sound waves https pbs. The more points we have the better the approximation. The picture below illustrates it pretty well. Lower frequencies correspond to infrared radio waves microwaves etc. Learn the basics Let s understand some of the theory to figure out what we missed in our naive approach from the previous step and come up with a more informed approach. What About Waves It seems that waves are a core concept necessary to understand signal processing. In the image below you can see how an electromagnetic wave contains both electric and magnetic field vectors orthogonal to each other and how we can apply the concepts of amplitude wavelength and frequency to this type of waves. net publication 346243843 figure fig1 AS 961807523000322 1606324191138 Short time Fourier transform STFT overview. jpg 2560px The_Gravitational_wave_spectrum_Sources_and_Detectors. jpg WaveletsWhat happens if an oscillation is only temporary and doesn t display the periodic pattern but still looks like a wave You might have seen these from a seismograph recording or a heart monitor. Side note humans can also analyse sounds and images in terms of their sinusoidal components our ears and eyes have developed to distinguish different frequencies. Khan Academy videos about waves3. The synthesis helps us create signals with known frequency content. Velocity equals distance over time so we can say V wavelength period wavelength frequency 1. It can be mapped on a diagram in a very similar way to transverse ways and the properties described above apply here as as well. Higher frequency corresponds to higher notes. jpg This idea that a signal can be a mix of different frequencies is why we need the frequency domain to better understand a signal. These waves are called electromagnetic waves. This is called short time Fourier transform. Now let s create a spectrogram by following this tutorial https www. com media E5lsNiQWQAQ_Fq6 format jpg name 4096x4096 A wave is a disturbance propagating through space usually transferring energy. Velocity tells us how quickly a wave is moving to the right. Let s start by considering how sound is produced via a loudspeaker. The analysis allows us to find the contribution of different frequencies in a given signal. Rainbow shows us how white light can be decomposed into colors. For example a typical sampling rate for audio signal is 44. I also learned about some of the founding fathers of signal processing Jean Baptiste Fourier 1768 1830 showed how any waveform could be represented as a series of weighted sine and cosine components of ascending frequency which set the foundation for modern Fourier analysis and the Fourier transform. org learn audio signal processing https www. Start by tinkering I already did this with a very naive approach first and a some more informed but still very blind experiments later. This in turn leads to a change in the electric field. Laplace developed the Laplace transform not sure yet what that is Claud Shannon developed the science of information theory Cooley and Turkey developed the FFT Fast Fourier transform in 1965 which allowed to obtain spectra in an efficient way. Wavelength measures the distance between two compressed regions of air. This can be for example the distance between 2 neighboring peaks. rainbow https upload. This can result in a chain reaction that propagates like a wave. Electromagnetic WavesWhen an electric field changes in some region that creates a changing magnetic field. I will work on this notebook over the next several weeks so you may come back when it s ready or join me on the learning journey. Gravitational WavesFinally time to cover the waves we re supposed to detect in the G2Net competition According to Wikipedia gravitational waves are disturbances in the curvature of spacetime generated by accelerated masses that propagate as waves outward from their source at the speed of light. Here some things I have learned Digital Signal Processing involves manipulation of signals that have their origins in the analog world such as audio video radar thermal magnetic or ultrasonic sensor systems Signals are originally analog and continuous in nature A transducer is a device that converts some form of energy to which it is designed to respond into an electrical signal. com c g2net gravitational wave detection discussion 250244 credit for finding example with strong signal https www. org wiki Nyquist E2 80 93Shannon_sampling_theorem. Here is an example of a wavelet. If you follow along I ll appreciate comments with feedback or questions Signal Processing System https upload. org wikipedia commons thumb 2 2f The_Gravitational_wave_spectrum_Sources_and_Detectors. But wouldn t it make sense to see both time and frequency at the same time Frequency can change over time right Here comes the spectrogram The way to create it is by performing FFT on segments of the signal with a moving window. org ka perseus images 7370593cc71daa2ccaca091cec088fa5fec6ca16. An interesting fact about electromagnetic waves is that they can propagate in vacuum and don t require a medium. A sampling rate tells us the number of samples per second 1 s unit is Hertz so we will use it here. Introduction to Signal Processing for Absolute BeginnersIf you have no idea what spectrogram or frequency mean and Fourier transform sounds like a magic spell then you re like me Let s get on a journey together to find out how to process signals using G2Net competition data as examples. We use decibel scale to measure loudness of sounds. Higher frequencies correspond to ultraviolet X rays gamma rays etc. Higher amplitude means higher volume and lower amplited means lower volume. This is an example of transverse wave because the medium string is moving up and down. MOOCs on Coursera https www. org wiki Spectral_leakage according to discussions the frequencies that interest us should be in this range. Such brief oscillation is a wavelet and we can also analyse and use them with our digital signal processing tools. png Plan of AttackHow do we learn about this from scratch Here s my plan 1. Foundations of Digital Signal Processing by Patrick Gaydecki via google books 2. I can highly recommend Khan Academy videos such as this introduction to waves https www. basic wave concepts https pbs. That wave propagates through air and we can see the compressed region of molecules moving forward. Here are some things I have learned. The molecules don t just move forward like a ball that is kicked but they move forward and backward like a wave. That s why we re talking about moving from time domain to frequency domain Fourier analysis or from frequency domain to time domain Fourier synthesis. We can now see a gravitational wave signal on the spectrogram Sources1. There are a few properties of periodic waves that we should know about Amplitude is the height of a wave the maximum displacement measured from the equilibrium position Period measures the number of seconds per each cycle Frequency is the reverse of period it counts how many cycles can fit in a second. Each color is associated with a different frequency. We will start with a regular version then we will apply whitening. SoundThe concepts above apply to sound although it s a different type of wave. png Frequency DomainI ve been struggling to understand the concept of frequency domain if you re like me don t worry if this takes time to understand Let s start with a rainbow. If we repeat that movement and create a periodic pulse then we will create a periodic wave. com c g2net gravitational wave detection discussion 252138. We divide Intensity by the threshold of hearing 1e 12 W m2 take a log of this and multiply by 10. Ultrasound Sound waves can be useful beyond communication and entertainment For example sound waves with frequency higher than human hearing above 20 000Hz are used for medical imaging. In contrast to the string example above the movement is in the direction of propagated pulse so we call this a longitudinal wave. Preprocessing tutorials https www. svg 1920px MorletWaveletMathematica. And this is where our magic spell the Fourier transform comes in handy it allows us to decompose any signal into a set of sine and cosine functions. png Finally we re at a point where we can write some code Let s first look at our raw signal data. My conclusion is that I need to take another step back to high school physics to understand more about waves. Amplitude measures the displacement of air molecule as it oscillates. To calculate decibel level we need to know the Intensity of sound which corresponds to Power measured in Watts over Area measured in square meters. The SpectrogramOk so we just learned that we can move from time domain to frequency domain with the help of Fourier transform. org ka perseus images 9b999f75e599f3ed46c0ed16586410ec1e5ffc34. A device is emiting high frequency waves and captures the waves reflecteced by our internal organs to produce an image of our muscles tendons and many internal organs. If we take a single sample point it time it s not possible to approximate the sinusoidal frequency function. This signal is later converted into digital form. org wikipedia commons 5 5c Double alaskan rainbow. org wikipedia commons 4 46 Signal_processing_system. Frequency corresponds to the sound pitch. If we map all the possible frequencies wavelengths on a chart we call this electromagnetic spectrum. com mistag data preprocessing with gwpy sampling rate pick a shorter FTT time interval like 1 16 of a second and with a lot of overlap to resolve short time features and choose a window that minimizes spectral leakage https en. wavelet example https upload. Apply the learning in practice After getting some understanding let s put it to use to get some practise and verify if it works What is Digital Signal Processing I started by reading the first chapter from Foundations of Digital Signal Processing by Patrick Gaydecki via google books.
