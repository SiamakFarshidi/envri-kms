Chemical energy powerhouse of the cell produced by the mitochondria is stored in a small molecule called adenosine triphosphate ATP. Plasma Membrane 13 The plasma membrane also called the cell membrane is the membrane found in all cells that separates the interior of the cell from the outside environment. join kaggle input shopee product matching train_images f_name for f_name in train_gf. Solving the single cell image classification challenge will help us determine precise locations for all human proteins in each individual cell in our large collection of open access images. 2 WHICH PROTEINS OCCUR MOST OFTEN We Deduce From The Graph Output Below. The dataset is acquired in a highly standardized way using one imaging modality confocal microscopy. 1 VISUALIZE EACH LABEL USING IMAGES WHERE THAT IS THE ONLY LABEL PRESENT The trivial class of images are those where only one label is present. We can see below that just because a cell exists in a single label image there is no guarantee that it presents the required green staining to indicate that the protein is localized in the indicated organelle Cell Segmentator Tool Machine Learning and Data Science Imports Built In Imports Visualization Imports Submission Imports PRESETS Stop Tensorflow From Eating All The Memory Currently memory growth needs to be the same across GPUs Memory growth must be set before GPUs have been initialized Define the root data directory Define segmentation mask directory Define the paths to the training tiles for the cell wise classification dataset Define the paths to the training and testing tfrecord and image folders respectively Capture all the relevant full image paths Capture all the relevant full tfrec paths Define paths to the relevant csv files Create the relevant dataframe objects if the length the contours tuple returned by cv2. to_array train_ds train_ds. They are distinguished from thin filaments by their size 8 10 nm and the fact that thin filaments are obviously motile. We Deduce From The Output Below. For these classes the prediction will be very difficult as we have only a few examples that may not cover all variation normally present within these biological structures will be captured.

Mitotic Spindle 11 The mitotic spindle is the macromolecular machine that segregates chromosomes to two daughter cells during mitosis. Therefore we will iterate over his dataset and we will use it to create the square subset dataset7 nbsp nbsp SINGLE WEAK LABEL INDIVIDUAL CELL EXPLORATIONIn this section we will explore what the different classes look like at a cell level. The steps are as follows Find IDs with only one image level class label Leverage my previously created 256x256 single channel datasets and pull all the cell wise images for all of those single image level class label images. The organelle also modifies products of the endoplasmic reticulum to their final form. In these instances we know that every cell can be labelled accurately based on the image level label. 5 IDENTIFY CORRELATION IN IMAGES WITH MULTIPLE LABELS Identifying correlations between organelles found in multi label objects may help us deduce which organelles often pair together. 4 v4 beta or v4 official if the length of the contours tuple is 3 then we are using either OpenCV v3 v4 pre or v4 alpha otherwise OpenCV has changed their cv2. They are primarily composed of polymers of actin but are modified by and interact with numerous other proteins in the cell. Border cells are included when there is enough information to decide on the labels. The images in this dataset are confocal microscopy images containinng 4 channels R G B Y. Both Mitochondria and Nuclear Speckles are much more commonly found as individual image labels when compared to the gross distribution across all images. Almost all of the organelles only exhibit a slight correlation to other organelles. The main function of the Golgi apparatus is the ability to deliver vesicles or packets of various cell products to different locations throughout the cell. 1 INVESTIGATE TRAIN CSV BASICS Let s investigate the train. with other organelles as labels. In addition rare organelles like Aggresome s and No Label Negative also have very little representation in the dataset. Centrosomes are made of from arrangement of two barrel shaped clusters of microtubules called centrioles and a complex of proteins that help additional microtubules to form. If that is the case predict separate detections for each class using the same mask. In bacterial and plant cells a cell wall is attached to the plasma membrane on its outside surface. His dataset completes the CellSegmentator portion of the above process for us. This is the tool that the competition host team used in annotating the ground truth dataset. Images containing 3 or more labels are uncommon Images containing 5 labels only occur 3 times4. progress_apply lambda x get_phash x def tf_load_image path img_size 256 256 return decode_img tf. The organelle is also called the Golgi complex or Golgi body. 3 Distribution of Multiple Labels Per Image in the Training Data This will help us identify the trivial case one label present as well as the more difficult cases. Nucleoli Fibrillar Center 3 The Nucleolus Fibrillar Center FC is a sub compartment of most metazoan nucleoli. NOTE We already know that the maximum number of present labels for one image is 5. com rai555 hpa duplicate images in train I wanted to highlight similar images that can be found within the training dataset. Aggresome 15 An aggresome refers to an aggregation of misfolded proteins in the cell formed when the protein degradation system of the cell is overwhelmed.

Most train images only have 1 or 2 labels. map lambda x tf_load_image x train_ds train_ds. We can see that most common protein structures belong to coarse grained cellular components like the plasma membrane the cytosol and the nucleus Nucleoplasm. One slight exception might be the co occurence of microtubles and mitotic spindles within an image 20 Another slight exception is nucleoplasm negatively correlation 30 to 10 with the following in descending order of intensity nbsp nbsp nuclear speckles nbsp nbsp cytoplasm nbsp nbsp plasma membrane nbsp nbsp endoplasmic reticulum 5 nbsp nbsp IMAGE EXPLORATIONThis section will explore the images themselves and show examples of each class as well as certain common combinations. From this we can expect that we will struggle and will be forced to make less accurate predictions on the minor classes. 3 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON CELL MORPHOLOGYMost Of The Content For This Markdown Cell Comes From This Notebook Written By The Talented User Saurabh Shahane Nucleoplasm 0 The fluid inside the nucleus surrounded by nuclear membrane is called nucleoplasm It controls the cell s growth and reproduction because it contains cell s hereditary information Protein is localized to the NucleoplasmNuclear Membrane 1 A nuclear membrane is a double membrane that encloses the cell nucleus It serves to separate the chromosomes from the rest of the cell The nuclear membrane includes an array of small holes or pores that permit the passage of certain materials such as nucleic acids and proteins between the nucleus and cytoplasmNucleoli 2 Nucleoli are small basophilic spherical bodies located in the nucleus Usually they can be found in the central nuclear region but may also be close to the nuclear membrane. The major structural elements of the spindle are microtubule polymers whose intrinsic polarity and dynamic properties are critical for bipolar spindle organization and function. A give cell can have multiple labels and the segmentation maps and ground truth individual cell annotations are not provided. 2 Create Cell Classification Dataset The brilliant Kaggle user tito https www. 637833 eNqLi8xJM7BOTjS08DT2NfI38DfyM Q3NMAJgJJ RkBs7JecF5tnAADw Q9I7b018c5e3a20daba 1600 1066 16 0.

This will help us with visualizations and plotting later. 6 nbsp nbsp SEGMENTATION EXPLORATIONWe will use the CellSegmentator tool. This will be incredibly useful as it will allow us to identify classify Nucleoplasm s with a high degree of confidence in images containing Nucleoplasm s and other types of organelles. that are consistently found in cells presenting with the protein of interest Use this to show that many cells in the images may be Negative even though the image level class label is something else. The most common organelle Nucleoplasm is also the one most commonly used to individually identify an image. Cytosol 16 Cytosol is the liquid found inside of cells. Mitochondria 14 Mitochondria are membrane bound cell organelles mitochondrion singular that generate most of the chemical energy needed to power the cell s biochemical reactions. 2 IDENTIFY DUPLICATES WITHIN THE TRAINING DATA Inspired by this notebook https www. com c human protein atlas image classification is that we are being asked to classify the label s of each cell in every image with only weak image level training data compared to the classification of image level labels as done in the previous competition. They may stabilize organelles like the nucleus or they may be involved in specialized junctions. csv file at a high level first. Nuclear Speckles 4 The nuclear speckles are small subnuclear membrane less organelles or structures also called the splicing factor SF compartments that correspond to nuclear domains located in interchromatin regions of the nucleoplasmNuclear Bodies 5 Nuclear bodies are membraneless structures found in the cell nuclei of eukaryotic cells Nuclear bodies include Cajal bodies the nucleolus and promyelocytic leukemia protein nuclear bodiesEndoplasmic Reticulum 6 Endoplasmic reticulum ER is a continuous membrane system that forms a series of flattened sacs within the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells. The Golgi also has important functions in tagging vesicles with proteins and sugar molecules which serve as identifiers for the vesicles so they can be delivered to the proper target. 1 THE DATA BACKGROUND INFORMATIONIn this competition we are predicting protein organelle localization labels for each cell in the image. ER serves multiple functions being important particularly in the synthesis folding modification and transport of proteins. There are 2 columns nbsp nbsp ID nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp Unique Identifier Which Identifies Which Respective Image Is Being Referenced nbsp nbsp Label A delimited list of labels that exist within a given image The Label column has only 432 unique values The maximum number of unique labels in an image is 5 The minimum number of unique labels in an image is 1 NOTE We will also add a column titled string_label which will be the Label column with the full names of the classes labels replacing the integer representations. In contrast small or thin components like the mitotic spindle microtubles and vesicles are very seldom in our train data. Microtubules 10 Microtubules are microscopic hollow tubes made of the proteins alpha and beta tubulin that are part of a cell s cytoskeleton a network of protein filaments that extends throughout the cell gives the cell shape and keeps its organelles in place. findContours is 2 then we are using either OpenCV v2. We Deduce From The Graph Output Below. from_tensor_slices os. However the dataset comprises 17 different cell types of highly different morphology which affect the protein patterns of the different organelles. It is the water based solution in which organelles proteins and other cell structures float. decode_png img channels n_channels return tf.
