It is a probability distribution with mean of zero and variance in the order of N. com photos 3VzJwKx6hGc Artificial Intelligence is not yet really intelligent it is a linear regression technique and with a lot of data and a lot of compute power you can still deliver amazing results. Looking at the printouts it became apparent why. 7 of the samples between 3 and 3 Multiple with the standard deviation to get the right variance or simply use the python numpy. begin pmatrix x_ 1 x_ 2 end pmatrix begin pmatrix x_ 1 rho x_ 1 sqrt 1 rho 2 x_ 2 end pmatrix generates two correlated normal variables binom w_ 1 w_ 2 with given correlation coefficient rho In the active_inference library spm_DEM_z. This is less plausible for biological reality random fluctuations originate from dynamical systems themselves e. It produces the numbers from an initial seed value. And the sum of all the random numbers is not exactly zero. Gaussian refers to the probability distribution with respect to the value in this context the probability of the signal falling within any particular range of amplitudes. The noise samples are identically distributed but not independent. multi dimensional noise exampleLet s generate an n dimensional zero mean white gaussian noise N 0 Sigma _ w with a certain covariance matrix Sigma _ w. Note Friston is also sometimes referring to a roughness parameter gamma where sigma 2 frac 2 gamma so the filter becomes h t e frac t 2 2 sigma 2 e frac gamma 4 t 2 Let s see the effects of the various roughness parameters on the convolution in the graph below. The covariances will inevitably change because we introduced temporal correlation. Image you want a robotic soccer player intercept a rolling ball one of the hardest things to do. 612204 top 0 h 3 delta 1. 688045 top 0 h 5 delta 0. as sigma gets smaller the filter gets smaller and increasingly less datapoints around the current sample will add weight to smoothen the signal so the signals keeps its original roughness. Understanding the resultsAs expected With sigma to 0 the convoluted noise will be the same as the white noise and therefor matching the covariances matrix. Armed with this knowledge you should be in a position to better understand the following lines of Matlab code in the active_inference library spm_DEM_z. Random fluctuations are sufficiently fast that we do not observe their serial or temporal correlations. 8 in the graph mean sum N. Python has standard functions to generate these random numbers e. 826007 sigma 15 8 why is the convoluted noise not close to 0 Maybe if I take a wide filter high gamma the line will come close to zero because the average is almost zero But it is not. Auto correlation is the correlation of one time series data to the same time series data whith a time lag tau expressed on the horizontal axis in the graph see this video on auto correlation https www.

As expected white noise gives a low autocorrelation while the normalized convoluted noise shows higher correlations. Noise with temporal smoothnessWelcome to my notebook on Kaggle. How to normalize the sequence can be best seen by regarding the convolution as a matrix calculation bar w wP. In discrete time white noise is a discrete signal whose samples are regarded as a sequence of serially uncorrelated random variables with zero mean and finite variance Identically distributed and statistically independent random variables are the simplest representation of white noise White noise can be produced by randomly choosing each sample independentlyEasy example is throwing a six sided dice 100 times which will give you a random sequence with a uniform distribution 1 6 th each number although it is not zero mean but you get the point Gaussian white noise Gaussian white noise is a random signal with a Gaussian intensity normal distribution. use the python numpy. org wikipedia commons 6 6a Convolution_of_box_signal_with_itself2. And somehow as humans we can receive a ball without a second thought. Photo by Jason Rosewell https unsplash. How noise with temporal smoothness is generated in Active InferenceThe following lines of Matlab code in the active_inference library spm_DEM_z. Generate Gaussian white Noise1. The matlab sqrtm function calculates the Matrix square root where X sqrtm A returns the principal square root of the matrix A that is X X A. Easy example is throwing 2 six sided dice 100 times which will give you a random sequence but not with a uniform distribution e. In the notebook below my investigation. org wiki Covariance_matrix https machinelearningmastery. Therefore these signals are continuous and not infinitely rough as is white noise for example. com watch v N zd T17uiE. uk spm K toeplitz exp t. com story karl friston free energy principle artificial intelligence Understanding Active Inference and the FEP is not easy and has many intricate details if you needed to google the word intricate it proves the point. gif The mathematical expression of convoluting our Gaussian white noise w with filter h bar w t int_ infty infty w t tau h tau delta tau where bar w t is the convoluted version of the noise w t In discrete time used in simulations it becomes bar w t sum_ n infty infty w t n h n Filter h t In the FEP the white gaussian noise will be convoluted with an unnormalized Gaussian filter with standard deviation sigma and zero mean. One of these intricate details is the creation of noise with temporal smoothness noise samples at consecutive times that are correlated. Thus the sum of N random zero mean Gaussian numbers is not exactly zero. Please play around for yourself to get the intuition what is happening. Below my notes sigma 0. It is nicely explained in video https www. Convolution to create smoothness in the noises i. This means higher order derivatives of the noise do contain information as also the noise is differentiable with finite variance in contrast to white noise that has infinite variance so there is no information in higher order derivatives. 395466 top 0 h 1 delta 1. Typically noise is expressed like in a Linear dynamical system https en. By reuse of the same seed value we can generate the same random sequences. com dictionary noise refers to any random fluctuations of data. org wiki Free_energy_principle by examples in this case the generation of noise with temporal smoothness which is some form of colored noise in signal processing or what I would call Natural noise. I did record my notes so it might help others in their journey to understand Active Inference minimizing the underlying Free Energy https en. Note that we are still looking at intermediate results because next step is the normalization of the data which will also impact the position of the line. Let s print the estimated covariance matrix and mean of the convoluted noise. Below illustration gives you the intuition of convolution. Why noise Noise https www. org wiki Linear_dynamical_system where the state space is described as basic form dot x f x u w y g x z The noise appears in the equations z is noise in the measurement random fluctuations of sensory states w noise in the actual environment random fluctuations of the motion of hidden states x is the hidden state being estimated y is the observation u is the control signal f and g are functions to describe the dynamic system. 158 why is the convoluted noise above the white noise spikes I was somehow expecting to see the line to be closer around zero not having spikes even above the white noise random numbers are drawn from a zero mean Gaussian some some do they not balance out Looking at the printouts of sample examples it became apparent why. The smaller the sigma the closer the match to the covariance matrix of the white noise but also less temporal smoothness. Irrelevant or meaningless data or output occurring along with desired information. Gaussian white noise. The noise with temporal smoothness is generated in main 3 steps 1. com watch v 9B5vEVjH2Pk The Cholesky decomposition is commonly used in simulating systems like Monte Carlo to generate random sequences with multiple correlated variables https en. While the term white refers to the way the signal power is distributed i. In example above the mean is 0. Drawing random numbers from a zero mean gaussian does not mean you get nicely alternating positive and negative values. In nature noise and other inaccuracies are all around us and biological life as well engineering algorithms e. This could be solved with some extra padding with random numbers if needed. We can however achieve normalization back to the original variances. For example compare the efficiency of different algorithms under same circumstances. org wiki Kalman_filter need to function despite these fluctuations. 158 corresponding to gamma 80 is often used. org wiki Random_walk with Gaussian steps. Since we want for bar w the same variance as w TODO Note that F T F since F only has the diagonal filled And let s see the effect of the various roughness parameters on the normalized convolution in the graph below. m from the Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging SPM https www. So like the Cholesky decomposition the Matrix square root function is used to generate sequences with multiple correlated variables. source WIKI https upload. We can therefore find Gaussian white noise but also Poisson Cauchy etc. We are going to normalize the sequence by multiplying P by an by normalisation matrix F bar w wPF such that the variances of w will be equal to bar w. Research into true biological inspired artificial intelligence continues and neuroscience has produced a candidate which suggests that several global brain theories might be unified within a free energy framework Free Energy Principle FEP by Karl Friston The genius neuroscientist who might hold the key to true AI https www. Why noise with temporal smoothness In conventional control theory it is assumed that fluctuations are independent a sequence of serially uncorrelated random variables with zero mean infinitely rough. This notebook is to help catalyze knowledge and research on Active Inference in an engineering robotics data sciences machine learning context. Normalize to the original variancesVisible inspection of the convoluted noise shows immediately that the variance of the convoluted noise is not the same anymore as variance of the random noise as defined in the covariance matrix Sigma _ w. Interesting to see is that the normalization also pulls the graph closer to zero even with a wide filter. com watch v ZjaBn93YPWo for an introduction if needed. In other words if we take a wide filter high sigma the y position of the horizontal line is a probability distribution with mean of zero and variance increasing with N increasing and not always close to 0 3. 5 of the samples between 2 and 2 98. In essence every i th element of the diagonal of P is divided by the root of the i th element of P TP which is in essence the integral of the filter in each column such that the i th element of the diagonal F TP TPF equals 1. 23594336400718183 N 101 so the sum is 23. Random walk with Gaussian steps The sum of the random numbers develops as a random walk https en. The other way around is also true with sigma to infty the convoluted noise will be less matching the covariance matrix of random white noise a straight line is not particular random. 8 resulting in a straight line on 23. T to align with w Try traditional normalisation as a way to get correct zero mean and correct variance Setting up the data dimension of noise white noise Sqrtm method convoluted noise Smoothened noise Alternative smoothened noise normalize mean to 0 normalize variance to original covariance matrix Plot the result Calculate the variance covariance of the generated data sets. Could we avoid the last normalization step by taking a normalized Gaussian Filter Could we take an alternative approach in the last normalization step and apply a traditional normalization of the dataset this will move stretch the convoluted noise line vertically to the values of the original covariance matrix and will keep a temporal smoothness Something that could be further investigated. For now let us understand how FEP generates natural noise. See example below by chance the first 5 numbers are positive and all contribute most to the convoluted result. 063202 top 0 h 2 delta 1. Something interesting to test in some subsequent notebooks. It is noise with some form of temporal smoothness. So what is convolution For a quick refresher see Convolution on wiki https en. Having a robotic system working reliable under uncertainty is a significant challenge. In the FEP it is achied by normalizing P with F where F diagonal left frac 1 sqrt diag P TP right Below example shows what it calculates so you can build the intuition for it. com introduction to expected value variance and covariance or https www. Hence the recommendation in the FEP is for sigma to be 1 but don t make it too small else you dont have enough temporal smoothness. The Free Energy assumes a Gaussian filter. You have fluctuations in the omni vision camera system to detect the ball the wheels to drive for intercept the ball itself is not rolling straight and so on and so forth. begin pmatrix 1 rho 0 sqrt 1 rho 2 end pmatrix begin pmatrix 1 rho rho 1 end pmatrix So if we have 2 two uncorrelated Gaussian random variables binom x_ 1 x_ 2 of mean 0 and variance 1 then begin pmatrix 1 0 rho sqrt 1 rho 2 end pmatrix. Did some experiments and printed the intermediate results in the old fashioned for next embedded loop some code blocks above. org wiki White_noise White noise White noise is a random signal having equal intensity at different frequencies giving it a constant power spectral density. m from the Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging the generation of sequences makes use of the function spm_sqrtm which extends matlab sqrtm functionality by using a computationally expedient approximation. sqrt variance N Show the first 80 values for visual inspection Plot Gaussian white noise sequence to get the rough ragged noise due to the Identically distributed and statistically independent Print the distribution plot to showcase the bell curve The more values the better the curve becomes visible to plot the data Show with the same random seed we get the same random sequence Let s compare both methods with a low and high correlation covariance matrix input covariance matrix input high correlation note this matrix must be symmetric since it is a covariance matrix note on the diagonal you will find the variances Generate white Gaussian noise sequences dimension of noise Sqrtm method Cholesky method same random seed to generate the same sequences Plot the white noise sequence Calculate the variance covariance of the generated data sets in FEP sigma is usually 0. Which makes sense a random generator that is forced to the sum of all random drawn numbers is always zero actually can only pick 0 every time and that is not random anymore. With sigma to infty the convoluted noise will be a straight line equal to the sum of all random values. Understanding the resultsThe results were somehow different as I expected so needed to reconcile for myself to understand what is happening. Auto correlationBecause we introduced temporal correlations in the noise we should be able to see this in the autocorrelation of the normalized convoluted noise. Properties of a one dimensional random walk with Gaussian steps The expectation of a random walk is 0 thus the mean of all random numbers approaches zero as the number of steps increases. The covariance matrix is a square and symmetric matrix For a quick refresher on covariance matrixes https en. ConvolutionThe Free energy principle assumes that noise has some form of temporal smoothness because random fluctuations originate from dynamical systems themselves. We can make use of the fact that the Python s random module is not truly random it is pseudo random with a deterministic algorithm. uk spm generate the noise with temporal smoothness K toeplitz exp t.
