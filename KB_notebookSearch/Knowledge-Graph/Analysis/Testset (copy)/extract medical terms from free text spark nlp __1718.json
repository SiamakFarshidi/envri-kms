Import license keysWhile Spark NLP is available for free the Healthcare version is not except for a one month free trial. Many thanks to Jiri and David from JS labs for their help and support. Because it depends on a license this notebook will not run if you fork it unless you bring your own license keys. Categories Entities extracted Display example outputs as HTML Shorter text. Only one category a df with all the words to populate with ground truth and extracted Flatten the TruePos Set GT on the AllWords Set Extracted on the AllWords Confusion matrix calculate precision recall curve calculate F1 score plot no skill plot the roc curve for the model show the plot. You ll need to purchase a Spark NLP for Healthcare license from JS labs once you decide to use it for your purposes. NOTE pyspark df not pandas df. F1 will be calculated for each major group diagnosis procedure labs meds etc. Plan The performance of the extraction algorithm will be measured with F1 score the harmonic mean of precision and recall based on the good old confusion matrix TP TN FP FN. Install dependenciesImport dependencies into Python and start the Spark session Select the NER model and construct the pipelineSelect the NER model ner_diseases ner_clinical ner_jsl For more details https github. It extracts all the medical terms such as diagnosis procedure lab medications etc. com JohnSnowLabs spark nlp models pretrained models spark nlp for healthcare Create example input Use the pipeline to create outputs Display results Diagnosis only Calculate confusion matrix at the TOKEN level not entity level So myelodisplastic syndrome is actually 2 tokens to be extracted and not what would be preferrable at ONE entity. Extract medical terms from free text with Spark NLP HealthcareThis notebook was modified from the original one from JSL. Diagnosis Procedures models ner_diseases ner_clinical ner_jsl Create the pipeline Free Text Visualize outputs as data frame. from free text while using an impressive state of the art NLP tool Spark NLP for Healthcare from https www. but it s much easier to calculate and semi manually annotate the texts Install Java Install pyspark Install Spark NLP You can change this to the model you want to use and re run cells below.
