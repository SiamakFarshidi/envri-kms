A good indication that the brain can match position speed acceleration i. In the example above left Sigma right 3x6x9 162 Sigma and Pi are both positive semi definite https en. If you start moving the sensory observations change and we already concluded in the previous notebook there has to be a deep connection between action and perceptual inference because predicting y t 1 is relative to yourself moving. sufficient statistics zeta for the recognition density under Laplace approximation simplifies to mean mu. The least I could do is to put math as much as possible in the Annex and use plenty examples. In fact the hidden causes do have dependencies exactly the patterns that need to be inferred to construe the generative model from the sensory observations. The recognition density simplifies from a distribution to a single value to q x mu mu. Active inference assumes independent noises random fluctuations both w on hidden states and z on sensory observations are not correlated. It is the variance of the Gaussian filter used to convolute the white noise. Same for Sigma here a covariance matrix but in different context a summation Sigma p x_i p x_1 p x_2.

A variance of 1 does not tell how much noise it is if the main signal is in an order of magnitude of 100 it is 1 but if the main signal was around 1 it is 100. Things can move but not teleport. For example function of motion estimates how e. jpg Inference the generative modelHow does the brain learn and improve the generative model from the sensory observations Until now we have been lowering the Free energy by inferring the hidden states x given a generative model and precision matrix.

If you sit still but things are moving around you the next sensory prediction y t 1 should be correlated to previous prediction y t. Recognition density The recognition density q x zeta is the brain estimating hidden states x given sensory data y with a probability distribution. The value of the i th diagonal element of S s 2 can be written as S s 2 _ i i frac 1 2s 2 i 1 prod_ j 1 i 2j 3 and the same terms on the anti diagonals are alternatingly positive and negative. This is called local linearity https www. Appendix secA 1. Where w are random fluctuations of the motion of hidden states making it a probabilistic model. Perception action learning and attention are all different but complementary means for the reduction of free energy equals reduction of prediction error equals reduction of surprise in the sensory data. Under the Laplace mean field approximations estimating hidden causes simplify to estimating mean mu instead of a full recognition density. Instead of estimating a whole distribution it is under the Laplace approximation sufficient to iterately find the mean mu with the highest probability. The delta between the belief of the hidden states and the prediction of the function of motion mu f mu in this simplest example. Generative process sec32 1. y is the continuous stream of sensory observations the data from the available sensory set. So if x is the position then x t is the functional expression for the speed eg x t 1 expresses a constant speed of 1 x t x expresses an acceleration etc. com watch time_continue 727 v p_di4Zn4wz4 you will find a good explanation of the essence of differential equations leading to states space models capturing the laws of physics.

Simulation results with a 7 DOF robot manipulator shows a number advantages of an Active Inference Controller AIC over a more conventional controller MRAC. Under some fairly basic assumptions the integrals and probability densities in the Free Energy translate into a straightforward prediction error minimization scheme as we will see in this notebook. We only assume noises are independent but not the hidden causes. The dynamics of nature laws of physics are expressed in differential equations eg frac partial partial t x t f x t or in condensed x t f x t notation which express the motion of x over time.

Laplace Gauss is an another name for the Gaussian distribution hence the name Laplace approximation. Under the Laplace mean field approximations estimating hidden states simplify to estimating mean mu instead of a full recognition density. In short The more noisy the environment higher variance the bigger the variances of the higher order motion and thus less taken into account.

Yes there might be a weak indirect dependency if there is sunshine the cat prefers to be outside so it might hunt mice. Thus partial_ x f x is the derivative of function f with respect to x and x t is the time derivative of x.

The second part of the free energy formula frac 1 2 begin vmatrix Pi end vmatrix denotes that under more certainty lower variance the brain is able to lower the free energy more and thus less surprise in sensory states The higher the precision the Free energy can be lowered faster and lower. Makes sense Therefore the brain needs to have a good generative density encoding a probabilistic model of the environment world in which it is immersed in order to minimize the Free Energy effectively. It still is a sum of precision weighted quadratic prediction errors but now on all including higher order motions. Noise is modelled in the Free Energy Principle as fluctuations in the actual states and fluctuations in the measurement. Computation of the generalised precision matrix secA4 1.

Because the world has structure the brain can predict. p vartheta tilde y Generative density the brain encoding a probabilistic model of the environment world in which it is immersed. speed is connecting positions spatial over time temporal. Covariance matrix math secA4 1. There is a famous case https www. jpg Generative density Now the math gave this simplified result mathcal F y mu approx ln p mu y let s also think for a moment what it implies. also noted as a or alpha mathcal F tilde y mu The Free Energy mathcal F tilde y zeta which simplifies under lapace assumption to mathcal F tilde y mu q vartheta mu recognition density with sufficient statistics mu the brain to estimate the hidden causes given observations y Ensemble density q vartheta zeta Simplifies under lapace assumption to q vartheta mu mu. The generic expression for all cases eg dynamic environments multivariate of the Laplace Free Energy in matrix notation see annex Laplace encoded Free Energy math part 3 secA3 as is used in the Free Energy scientific papers mathcal F y mu frac 1 2 varepsilon T Pi varepsilon frac 1 2 ln begin vmatrix Pi end vmatrix where varepsilon are the prediction errors varepsilon begin bmatrix varepsilon_y varepsilon_x end bmatrix begin bmatrix y g mu mu f mu end bmatrix and Pi is the Precision matrix the inverse of the Covariance Matrix Sigma Pi begin bmatrix Pi_z 0 0 Pi_w end bmatrix begin bmatrix Sigma_z 0 0 Sigma_w end bmatrix 1 and begin vmatrix Pi end vmatrix is the determinant https en. Generalised precision matrix sec82 1. That is why it is called an approximation. Like the Free Energy can be minimized by Improving perception mu_x underset mu_x Argmin mathcal F y mu Acting on the environment u underset u Argmin mathcal F y mu Also the Free Energy can be minimized by Learning the generative model how the brain encodes the environment mu_ Theta underset mu_ Theta Argmin mathcal F y mu Attention or optimizing the expected precision regulating the learning mu_ lambda underset mu_ lambda Argmin mathcal F y mu. Appendix Laplace encoded Free Energy math part 1In this annex the main steps for a simple case with a single hidden state x and a single hidden state y vector of 1 number are explained.
