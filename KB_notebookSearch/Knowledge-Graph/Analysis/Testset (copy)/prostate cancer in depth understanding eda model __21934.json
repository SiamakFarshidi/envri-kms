TIFF is very common for transporting color or gray scale images into page layout applications but is less suited to delivering web content. Each epithelial unit is separate and has a lumen. e no cancer has the most number of values and that s what expected in case of most medical datasets the target class will always be underrepresented and that s also the most important challenge when performing machine learning tasks on Medical DATANow let s Look at how much data is provided by which data providerI learned about adding the numerical values i. For instance an image may be defined as uint8 unsigned integer 8 bit which means that each pixel can have a value intensity between 0 255 and each intensity is a whole number integer in that range. BUT since we are complete beginners let s first understand the format of image that is provided to us and all the image related jargons that we will be using further Q1 What is. The probe uses sound waves to create a picture of your prostate gland. D Prostatic adenocarcinoma Gleason Pattern 5 has an almost complete loss of glandular differentiation. This microphotograph shows irregular cribriform cancer i. Let s check what is the ISUP grade for these gleason scores That s Quite Interesting they both map to zero ISUP grade. This is a standard way of staining the originally transparent tissue to produce some contrast. C Prostatic adenocarcinoma Gleason Pattern 4 has partial loss of glandular differentiation. A laboratory pathologist examines a sample of your cancer to determine how much cancer cells differ from the healthy cells. All microphotographs show hematoxylin and eosin stains at 20x lens magnification. Applying the color map fixes the problem by assigning each label between 0 and 6 a distinct color. epithelial sheets with multiple lumina. e 2 but to our surprise 4 3 maps to two different values hence we have some mislablled info here Let s go ahead and check thatWe can see there is one mislabelled information like that let s go ahead and drop this Also negative and 0 0 are same labels only from different data providers and are interchangeable Let s go ahead and change negative to 0 0 LET s now Look at the test fileThey are only 3 images in the test and they too are hidden and we have access to them only when we are submitting for information on how to submit on hidden test set read here https www. Collecting a sample of prostate tissue If initial test results suggest prostate cancer your doctor may recommend a procedure to collect a sample of cells from your prostate prostate biopsy. There are also some poorly formed small glands and some fused glands. Just watch the video below Q5 I got it but What is ISUP grade now According to current guidelines by the International Society of Urological Pathology ISUP the Gleason scores are summarized into an ISUP grade on a scale from 1 to 5 according to the following rule Gleason score 6 ISUP grade 1 Gleason score 7 3 4 ISUP grade 2 Gleason score 7 4 3 ISUP grade 3 Gleason score 8 ISUP grade 4 Gleason score 9 10 ISUP grade 5 If there is no cancer in the sample we use the label ISUP grade 0 in this competition. The glands are grouped together. Prostate specific antigen PSA test A blood sample is drawn from a vein in your arm and analyzed for PSA a substance that s naturally produced by your prostate gland. Intermediate levels can be created by downsampling a higher resolution level. IMAGE MASKS Selecting the level SELECTING R from RGB SELECTING BG SELECTING BENIGN LABELS SELECTING CANCEROUS LABELS SELECTING NON CANCEROUS LABELS if train. Palette and gray scale images are limited to 256 colors or shades. If a DRE or PSA test detects an abnormality your doctor may recommend further tests to determine whether you have prostate cancer such as Ultrasound If other tests raise concerns your doctor may use transrectal ultrasound to further evaluate your prostate. test and ask any queries in the comment sectionOne tip for Better visualization always go through the documentation of the function you are using to visualize and play with all the parameters it takes you will surprise yourself with suprisingly new thingsNow Let s Look at the gleason score distribution as wellFrom this graph it is also clear that the data will be baised towards non cancer examples Image EDANow we can finally move on to Image EDA. Understanding Masks Q What are masks Apart from the slide level label present in the csv file almost all slides in the training set have an associated mask with additional label information. In this notebook I will start with complete explanation of everything you need know related to Prostate Cancer and its detection and I will built on that to explain the dataset perform EDA and then Build a baseline model This kernel will be a work in Progress and I will keep on updating it as the competition progresses and I learn more and more things about the data If you find this kernel useful Please consider Upvoting it it motivates me to write more Quality content References https www. ZOOMED FUGURE UNZOOMED FIGURE Making Openslide Object Here we compute the pixel spacing the physical size of a pixel in the image OpenSlide gives the resolution in centimeters so we convert this to microns Reading the image as before betweeen x 1780 to y 1950 and of pixel size 256 256 Displaying Image Visualizing Only six Examples Here we compute the pixel spacing the physical size of a pixel in the image. com rohitsingh9990 panda eda better visualization simple baseline Domain Knowledge 101So lets start with the domain knowledge and Address the first question Q1 What is Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer is cancer that occurs in the prostate a small walnut shaped gland in men that produces the seminal fluid that nourishes and transports sperm. The grading system recognizes three categories 3 4 and 5. This rotation has no clinical value and is only dependent on how the biopsy was collected in the lab. To more easily inspect the masks we map the int labels to RGB colors using a color palette. tff format and Why it is used Tagged Image File Format TIFF is a variable resolution bitmapped image format developed by Aldus now part of Adobe in 1986. To do this we load both the mask and the biopsy and merge them using PIL. Small glands infiltrate between benign glands. If you prefer something like matplotlib you can also use plt. I wonder why there are two labels mapping to the same thing let s also check their numberThat s Quite a big number it s 2892 10616 27 oercent of the total data We have seem from the figure showing mappings of ISUP from gleason that 3 4 and 4 3 map to different ISUP scores while other pairs like 3 5 and 5 3 4 5 and 5 4 map to same ISUP let s verify it Hence it is indeed the case It is due to this reason modeling this as a predictive problem for gleason score then converting it into ISUP is a much better strategy than to model it as ISUP predictive problem directly Let s also check if 3 4 and 4 3 gleason scores maps to 2 and 3 respectivelyWe can see that 3 4 maps to one unique Isup i. indexed and RGB i. The most common scale used to evaluate the grade of prostate cancer cells is called a Gleason score. Another way to interpret this would be layers. So what we need to do is to grab read the image file using openslide object take out the values of Red Level and then apply cmap to itUsing a small helper function we can display some basic information about a mask. mallika transform your graphs with seaborn ea4fa8e606a6After learning go ahead and play around the parameters of ax. It is typically used for zooming in on a small region of an image and foreliminating the pixelation effect that arises when a low resolution image is displayed on arelatively large frameNow that we know all this we are good to go. Many applications incorporate their own extensions but a number of application independent extensions are recognized by most programs. Usually prostate cancer grows slowly and is initially confined to the prostate gland where it may not cause serious harm. B Prostatic adenocarcinoma Gleason Pattern 3 has no loss of glandular differentiation. com wouterbulten getting started with the panda datasetUpdates I have shared few more insights about the data I have explained how to create the image visualizations in detail I have explained everything there is about the mask provided to us for train setThis is what you can expect in future versions of this kernel New unique and improved Visualizations New Insights about the Data Baseline Model Complete Explanation of DEEP LEARNING TECHNIQUES to be used END NOTESThis notebook is work in progress. Gleason scoring combines two numbers and can range from 2 nonaggressive cancer to 10 very aggressive cancer though the lower part of the range isn t used as often. A number of methods may be used to compress TIFF files including the Huffman and LZW algorithms. This happens for the following two reasons The label information is stored in the red R channel the other channels are set to zero and can be ignored. Even compressed TIFF files are usually much larger than similar GIF or JPEG files. The tissue sample is analyzed in a lab to determine whether cancer cells are present. Gleason Pattern 5 may also contain solid sheets or strands of cancer cells. Because the files are so large and because there are so many possible variations of each TIFF file type few web browsers can display them without plug ins. You can learn more about ax. e EDA and getting Insights from data and then I build around this core by learning from some very great kernels posted on competitions. All of these are included in Gleason Pattern 4. TIFF files may or may not be compressed. Biopsies can be in different rotations. loc image data_provider karolinska Create alpha mask Mapping 0 background 1 stroma 2 benign epithelium 3 Gleason 3 4 Gleason 4 5 Gleason 5 Mapping 0 background 1 benign 2 cancer. An RGB red green blue type image uses three layers to define colour a single layer would define a large scale image some image types contain more than 3 layers. The masks are not image data like the WSIs. However if a higher than normal level is found it may indicate prostate infection inflammation enlargement or cancer. hese masks are provided to assist with the development of strategies for selecting the most useful subsamples of the images. imshow to directly show a mask without converting it to an RGB image. Note that in the second example eventhough a biopsy contains cancer not all epithelial tissue has to be cancerous. Each slide has 3 levels you can load corresponding to a downsampling of 1 4 and 16. e black and white Q3 What is Down sampling and Up sampling in Image processing Downsampling and upsampling are two fundamental and widely used image operations withapplications in image display compression and progressive transmission. 000 pixels in both x and y. Thus Biopsies can contain a mix of cancerous and healthy tissue. com wouterbulten getting started with the panda dataset https www. These masks directly indicate which parts of the tissue are healthy and which are cancerous. This overlay can help you identifying the different growth patterns. I am learning with every passing day I try to do atleast what I am good at i. org api python Now Let s see what all information can we get out of an image after creating an Openslide object This Function prints Zoomed and Non Zoomed images side by side and also all the information that can be derived from it You can read about what every function does in the documentation of Open slide You can play around with the read_region to zoom in different parts of an image and by little modifications you can build a function that takes in multiple images and displays their zoomed and non Zoomed Images side by side Now Let s Look at the Zoomed Images having different ISUP and gleason_scoreLooking at the images we can see and try to apply what we learned in the video for giving gleason_scoreOBSERVATIONS The image dimensions are quite large typically between 5. You can read more about the OpenSlide python bindings in the documentation https openslide. Baseline TIFF images are highly portable most graphics desktop publishing and word processing applications understand them. For each pixel there are 3 intensity levels 1 for each colour are defined and together using a kind of mixing of the colours they define the colour of that pixels. The mask values depend on the data provider Radboud Prostate glands are individually labelled Valid values are 0 background non tissue or unknown 1 stroma connective tissue non epithelium tissue 2 healthy benign epithelium 3 cancerous epithelium Gleason 3 4 cancerous epithelium Gleason 4 5 cancerous epithelium Gleason 5 Karolinska Regions are labelled Valid values are 1 background non tissue or unknown 2 benign tissue stroma and epithelium combined 3 cancerous tissue stroma and epithelium combined Q What happens when we visualize masks using the techniques we know Q A black canvas is displayed Surprised Wondering what that means The Masks for Train are in RGB format right as said by organizers. A Benign prostate glands with folded epithelium The cytoplasm is pale and the nuclei small and regular. The appearance of the glands forms the basis of the Gleason grading system. Q4 I didn t understand. Q6 How has the Gleason scores been generated in the dataset Each WSI in this challenge contains one or in some cases two thin tissue sections cut from a single biopsy sample. Q2 What are image levels In some image formats the image data has a fixed amount of possible intensities. Display the image Close the opened slide after use Here we compute the pixel spacing the physical size of a pixel in the image. I will keep on updating this kernel with my new findings learning process explained techniques etc in order to help everyone who is just beginning I hope you Liked my kernel. com akensert panda drawing rectangles work in progressWe will now visualize the cancerous and non cancerous areas of an image using image_masks and since we know masks are different for different data providers we will have to take into account in the function we builtNow that we have our function let s visualize Overlaying masks on the slidesNow That we have learned how to visualize masks and display them side by side Let s Overlay them on one anotherAs the masks have the same dimension as the slides we can overlay the masks on the tissue to directly see which areas are cancerous. Let s Verify if its the case SO we can clearly see that our understanding was correct. It is typically used to reduce the storage and or transmission requirements of images. com c prostate cancer grade assessment discussion 145219 EDAIt s time that I start doing my favourite thing Let s Start with the targetWe see that the isup_grade 0 and 1 i. Therefor when you try to visualize the mask it will appear very dark as every value is close to 0. Downsampling isthe reduction in spatial resolution while keeping the same two dimensional 2D representation. Q3 Where does GLEASON score fit in all of this When a biopsy confirms the presence of cancer the next step is to determine the level of aggressiveness grade of the cancer cells. RGB images may store up to 16. A small probe about the size and shape of a cigar is inserted into your rectum. The samples are made up of glandular tissue and connective tissue. I thought I knew EDA very well but indeed I was wrong. A higher grade indicates a more aggressive cancer that is more likely to spread quickly. Q2 How it is tested and detected Prostate screening tests might include Digital rectal exam DRE During a DRE your doctor inserts a gloved lubricated finger into your rectum to examine your prostate which is adjacent to the rectum. The cytoplasm is often dark and the nuclei enlarged with dark chromatin and some prominent nucleoli. Prior to scanning the tissue is stained with haematoxylin eosin H E. An upvote is a gesture of appreciation and encouragement that fills me with energy to keep improving my efforts be kind to show one STAY TUNED DATA visualization Open the image does not yet read the image into memory Read a specific region of the image starting at upper left coordinate x 17800 y 19500 on level 0 and extracting a 256 256 pixel patch. There is an attempt to form lumina but the tumor fails to form complete well developed glands. The TIFF specification is readily extensible though this comes at the price of some of its portability. Upsampling is the increasing of the spatial resolution while keeping the 2D representationof an image. The first mask is from Radboudumc and shows two different grades of cancer shown in yellow and orange. Prostate biopsy is often done using a thin needle that s inserted into the prostate to collect tissue. The glandular structure characteristic of healthy prostate tissue is progressively lost with increasing grade. So that gives 256 possible intensity levels. patches here https medium. Similarly for a grayscale there can be two levels i. Want to interactively view a slide We have added an interactive viewer to this notebook in the last section. However while some types of prostate cancer grow slowly and may need minimal or even no treatment other types are aggressive and can spread quickly. I will be using openslide to display images as I learned it in this competition from a very informative kernel https www. Now that we have learned how to visualize masks let s build a function which prints an image and its mask side by side provided that there is a mask So we are successful we can easily use this function to visualize on more than example by doing something like this Observations The images above shows two example masks from the dataset. At this point image data is read from the file and loaded into memory. I am a beginner on Kaggle and this is my first Image Computer Vision related competition. Yes you right in thinking there can be two values for gleason score 7 i. e 3 4 and 4 3 as we had learned in the video these both have different meanings. About this NotebookI have always seen that Kaggle competitions require a lot of domain knowledge and the main problems of a Kaggle beginner is not lack of Machine learning Knowledge but more often than not it is lack of domain knowledge. Since Kaggle provide us so many days for a competition we can always start from zero and end up learning all of the state of the art techniques just by following along a competition. That is what my strategy is all about. We will look at only 6 examples for better visualsLastly I will add heights and widths of images to my dataframe as it will help with my baseline We can see that width and height have almost similar distribution let s now quickly load some images using openslide and try to interpret them We saw as an example of how we can load data using openslide and then visualize a specific area and in our choice of pixel distribution We will now see how we can see openslide to gather information about the images What s NextThis is my first encounter with image data and I am also learning everything at the same data. OpenSlide gives the resolution in centimeters so we convert this to microns. If your doctor finds any abnormalities in the texture shape or size of the gland you may need further tests. The second mask is from Karolinska the region that contains cancer is higlighted in green. They are just matrices with values based on the data provider information provided above instead of containing a range of values from 0 to 255 they only go up to a maximum of 6 representing the different class labels check the dataset description for details on mask labels. Prostate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in men. Four types of baseline TIFF images are available bilevel black and white gray scale palette i. I also want to emphasize the fact that there is no need to be scared of Kaggle competitions I mean as a rookie we don t have anything to loose we can try out different things without fear and that s what I am doing and you can do too. There are noticable color differences between the biopsies this is very common within pathology and is caused by different laboratory procedures. Reasons for Usage IFF files are large and of very high quality. The glands are hollow structures which can be seen as white holes or branched cavities in the WSI. What is GLEASON score Please explain in detialDon t Worry I got you Pal. A common extension of TIFF also allows for CMYK images. Dispersed single cancer cells are seen in the stroma. com wouterbulten getting started with the panda datasetThe benefit of OpenSlide is that we can load arbitrary regions of the slide without loading the whole image in memory. PreliminariesNow Let s Begin by Importing the data Now that we know everything about ISUP_grade and Gleason_score let s look at how many unique values they have got as per our guesses ISUP must have 6 unique values 1 5 grades and 0 for non cancer and Gleason_score should have 8 values in total 2 10 for scores Interesting Right We were right about ISUP but gleason score has 11 unique values. There are always a lot of great kernels regarding different ways of solving the problems but only a few handful address the problems of domain knowledge and getting started. I have learned everything about the visualizations from here https www. The dimensions of each level differ based on the dimensions of the original image. Differentiating between cancerous and non cancerous areas using MASKSIdea Credits https www. e count and percentage on the countplot of seaborn from Rohit s kernels. It s normal for a small amount of PSA to be in your bloodstream.
