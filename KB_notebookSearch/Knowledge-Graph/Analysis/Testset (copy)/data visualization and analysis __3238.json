Now let s quickly take a look to test products Random item accessLet s make a random access to products by maping each product byte offset and length. Let s look at the first item Table CATEGORY_NAMES_DF shows the hierarchy of product classification. Let s display some of these most frequent category items MUSIQUE CD CD POP ROCK CD ROCK INDE Let s display some of these 31 less frequent categories Here is a plot of sorted category counts The goal of the competition is to predict category_id by image. 1000010653 by an image. Each dictionary contains product id key _id the category id of the product key category_id 1 4 images stored in a list key imgs. It takes around 3 mins to execute. Display for example a item with _id 1234 Explore categoriesLet s inspect categories and their relationship to images. category_id has 3 category tags of different levelsUsing category_id field we can associate image to 3 levels of category tags labels. linear algebra data processing CSV file I O e. Dataset announced features Almost 9 million products half of the current catalogue More than 15 million images at 180x180 resolution More than 5000 categories yes this is quite an extreme multi class classification Let s explore this in details Content First images in train and test datasets Random item access Explore categoriesPS. Following code creates a dictionary with key indexing item _id and values offset length. Thanks to this https www. We need to predict a number e. We have 5270 unique categories 49 unique level 1 categories 483 unique level 2 categories 5263 unique level 3 categoriesSo as it was asked in comments by microland we can observe that there are items with different category_id but the same category_level3 Here is the histogram of level 1 categoriesLevel 2 and 3 categories are distributed as follows Now let s create training data table _id category_id We have in training datasets 5270 unique categories in 7069896 entries 1 most frequent category found 79640 times MUSIQUE en.
