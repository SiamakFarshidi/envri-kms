Mathematically XGBoost s learning objective may be defined as follows obj \u03b8 l \u03b8 \u03a9 \u03b8 Here l \u03b8 is the loss function which is the Mean Squared Error MSE for regression or the log loss for classification and \u03a9 \u03b8 is the regularization function a penalty term to prevent over fitting. The larger min_child_weight is the more conservative the algorithm will be. Since L1 regularization in GBDTs is applied to leaf scores rather than directly to features as in logistic regression it actually serves to reduce the depth of trees.

See the Prediction and Evaluation section of this notebook for details of how the target is calculated. There are 14 coins in the dataset There are 4 years in the full datasetXGBoost XGBoost is a favorite choice on kaggle and it doesn t look like it is going anywhere It is basiclly the a version of gradient boosting machines framework that made the approach so popular. We might think of L1 regularization as more aggressive against less predictive features than L2 regularization. Booster parameters Are the actual parameters of the booster you have chosen. Mostly used values are binary logistic logistic regression for binary classification returns predicted probability not class multi softmax multiclass classification using the softmax objective returns predicted class not probabilities you also need to set an additional num_class number of classes parameter defining the number of unique classes multi softprob same as softmax but returns predicted probability of each data point belonging to each class. max_delta_step default 0 Maximum delta step we allow each leaf output to be. colsample_bylevel is the subsample ratio of columns for each level. The current copy which is just filled approximately the right amount of data from train. The result contains predicted probability of each data point belonging to each class. These two regularization terms have different effects on the weights L2 regularization controlled by the lambda term encourages the weights to be small whereas L1 regularization controlled by the alpha term encourages sparsity so it encourages weights to go to 0. Increasing this value will make model more conservative. TL DR What makes XGBoost great 1. colsample_bynode is the subsample ratio of columns for each node split. When choosing it please keep thread contention and hyperthreading in mind. Set it to value of 1 10 might help control the update.

XGBoost was the first wide spread GBM framework so it has more mileage then all other frameworks. After each boosting step we can directly get the weights of new features It makes the model more robust by shrinking the weights on each step. That is tuning Column Sub sampling in XGBoost By Tree. 2 colsample_bytree We can create a random sample of the features or columns to use prior to creating each decision tree in the boosted model.
