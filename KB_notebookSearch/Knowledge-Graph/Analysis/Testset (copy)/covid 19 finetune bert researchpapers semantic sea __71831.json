breathing 102 evidence supporting the concept of an anatomically distributed but shared network for both cough and breathing comes from a variety of preclinical studies showing that brainstem neurons in these locations alter their activities during both behaviors 98 99 101 102 108 110 th ese neurons are synaptically connected in ways that can explain motor drive to respiratory muscles during both behaviors 98 99 101 th e process by which selected populations of this distributed brainstem network alter their activities to account for both behaviors is known as reconfi guration 98 101 102 although complex the reconfi gured brainstem network hypothesis for cough does not yet account for the diff erential regulation of this behavior relative to breathing furthermore this network cannot account for the phenotype of response to coughsuppressive drugs fi rst shown by may and widdicombe 111 50 years ago centrally active antitussive drugs suppress cough in a dosedependent manner at doses that have no eff ect on breathing 111 112 by defi nition there must be some neural module in this brainstem network that is not required for breathing but is important for the full expression of cough some investigators have approached this problem using microinjection methods to apply antitussive drugs andor neurotransmitter agonists and antagonists to various brainstem regions 113 117 it is clear that familiar brainstem areas such as the nts could participate in the actions of antitussive drugs it is also clear that other areas not currently believed to have a command function for cough could be substrates for cough suppressants 113 115 these studies support the concept that there may be no single anatomic brainstem area or center that is susceptible to antitussive drugs but that these compounds may act at multiple sites when administered systemically th e extent to which these sites may contain undescribed elements of the brainstem network for cough is unknown but these fi ndings do support the idea that even though our current conceptualization of the brainstem cough network is complex it probably represents an underestimate of its true complexity paper_id

doctoral students and a faculty member in a research methods course as students we were facing a review of the literature for our dissertations we encountered several different ways of conducting a review but were unable to locate any resources that synthesized all of the various synthesis methodologies our purpose is to present a comprehensive overview and assessment of the main approaches to research synthesis we use research synthesis as a broad overarching term to describe various approaches to combining integrating and synthesizing research findings methods we conducted an integrative review of the literature to explore the historical contextual and evolving nature of research synthesis we searched five databases reviewed websites of key organizations handsearched several journals and examined relevant texts from the reference lists of the documents we had already obtained results we identified four broad categories of research synthesis methodology including conventional quantitative qualitative and emerging syntheses each of the broad categories was compared to the others on the following key characteristics purpose method product context underlying assumptions unit of analysis strengths and limitations and when to use each approach conclusions the current state of research synthesis reflects significant advancements in emerging synthesis studies that integrate diverse data types and sources new approaches to research synthesis provide a much broader range of review alternatives available to health and social science students and researchersresearch synthesis is the overarching term we use to describe approaches to combining aggregating integrating and synthesizing primary research findings each synthesis methodology draws on different types of findings depending on the purpose and product of the chosen synthesis see additional file 1based on our current knowledge of the literature we identified these approaches to include in our review systematic review metaanalysis qualitative metasynthesis metanarrative synthesis scoping review rapid review realist synthesis concept analysis literature review and integrative review our first step was to divide the synthesis types among the research team each member did a preliminary search to identify key texts the team then met to develop search terms and a framework to guide the reviewover the period of 2008 to 2012 we extensively searched the literature updating our search at several time points not restricting our search by date the dates of texts reviewed range from 1967 to 2015 we used the terms above combined with the term method eg realist synthesis and method in the database health source academic edition includes medline and cinahl this search yielded very few texts on some methodologies and many on others we realized that many documents on research synthesis had not been picked up in the search therefore we also searched google scholar pubmed eric and social science index as well as the websites of key organizations such as the joanna briggs institute the university of york centre for evidencebased nursing and the cochrane collaboration database we hand searched several nursing social science public health and health policy journals finally we traced relevant documents from the references in obtained textswe included works that met the following inclusion criteria 1 published in english2 discussed the history of research synthesis 3 explicitly described the approach and specific methods or 4 identified issues challenges strengths and limitations of the particular methodology we excluded research reports that resulted from the use of particular synthesis methodologies unless they also included criteria 2 3 or 4 abovebased on our search we identified additional types of research synthesis eg metainterpretation best evidence synthesis critical interpretive synthesis metasummary grounded formal theory still we missed some important developments in metaanalysis for example identified by the journals reviewers that have now been discussed briefly in the paper the final set of 197 texts included in our review comprised theoretical empirical and conceptual papers books editorials and commentaries and policy documentsin our preliminary review of key texts the team inductively developed a framework of the important elements of each method for comparison in the next phase each text was read carefully and data for these elements were extracted into a table for comparison on the points of key characteristics purpose methods and product see

practices and after implementation of the intervention results current decontamination practices did not significantly reduce viral loads on surfaces p 3113 but h 2 o 2 wipe intervention did p 0065 bacteriophage spread to 56 2748 of sites and was reduced to 54 2648 and 40 1948 with current decontamination practices and intervention practices respectively conclusion results suggest firefighters hands were the main vehicles of microbial transfer current practices were not consistently applied or standardized and minimally reduced prevalence and quantity of microbial contamination on ems surfaces although use of a consistent protocol of h 2 o 2 wipes significantly reduced percent prevalence and concentration of viruses training and promotion of surface disinfection should be provided Abstract_Summary Background To our knowledge no studies todate demonstrate potential spread of microbesduring actual emergency medical service EMS activities. 8837 Paragraph as discussed previously the number of responding hospitals evolved over time the challenges of identifying a role for local public health bureaus in the cdcmn using negative pressure isolation wards during nonemergency operations and operating within a decreasing cdcmn budget resulted in a change in the number of regional responding hospitals from 25 hospitals in 2012 to 22 hospitals in 2013 to 6 hospitals in 2014 this alteration enhanced the local public health bureaus role in the hospital preparedness efforts by allowing them to identify and coordinate local responding hospitals and enabled local hospitals to use negative pressure isolation rooms during daily operations which better justified the investment required to maintain them in addition the 6 regional responding hospitals received more cdcmn resources previously diverted to 25 hospitals to maximize the effectiveness the changes create a more costeffective network that still maintains flexibility taiwans hospital preparedness and response and surge capacity during an epidemic although changes from 2013 to date showed improvement in the operation and budget allocation current challenges such as the cost for renewal and replacement of the medical equipment in responding hospitals the development of integrated and comprehensive training courses of core skills for healthcare workers and risk compensation payments need the taiwanese governments ongoing commitment and collaboration with medical partners to continue efforts in enhancing a more solid and effective system paper_id cc6cb3af2ef6432cf20dd2c84b56fdb8be780078 Title Taiwan s Experience in Hospital Preparednessand Response for Emerging Infectious Diseases Abstract taiwan has undergone several phases of modification in structure and activation the main organizing principles of the cdcmn are centralized isolation of patients with severe highly infectious diseases and centralization of medical resources as well as a network of designated regional hospitals like those in other countries the cdcmn is made up of a command system responding hospitals and supporting hospitals it was tested and activated in response to the h1n1 influenza pandemic in 200910 and the ebola outbreak in west africa in 20142016 and it demonstrated highlevel functioning and robust capacity in this article the history structure and operation of the cdcmn is introduced globally for the first time and the advantages and challenges of this system are discussed the taiwanese experience shows an example of a collaboration between the public health system and the medical system that may

west africa evd presentation is nonspecific and characterized initially by onset of fatigue myalgias arthralgias headache and fever this is followed several days later by anorexia nausea vomiting diarrhea and abdominal pain anorexia and gastrointestinal losses lead to dehydration electrolyte abnormalities and metabolic acidosis and in some patients acute kidney injury hypoxia and ventilation failure occurs most often with severe illness and may be exacerbated by substantial fluid requirements for intravascular volume repletion and some degree of systemic capillary leak although minor bleeding manifestations are common hypovolemic and septic shock complicated by multisystem organ dysfunction appear the most frequent causes of death males and females have been equally affected with children 014 years of age accounting for 19 young adults 1544 years 58 and older adults 45 years 23 of reported cases while the current case fatality proportion in west africa is approximately 40 it

include operator dependence limited acoustic shadows a small field of view and poor evaluation of pulmonary veins the limitations of cardiac catheterization include the overlapping of great vessels difficulty in demonstrating systemic and pulmonary vessels at the same time catheterrelated complications and high doses of iodinated contrast material and ionizing radiation computed tomography ct can overcome these limitations 1 and previous studies widely reported its use in the evaluation of pediatric congenital heart disease 2e5 however there are longterm risks of developing lethal malignancy induced by radiation exposure of ct scan 6 7 children are at higher risk than adults because their tissues are more radiosensitive and they have longer life expectancies to develop a radiationinduced malignancy 8 recent studies have reported ct utilization trends in pediatric patients 9e11 fahimi et al 9 reported a dramatic increase in ct utilization among children presenting to the emergency department with abdominal pain menoch et al 10 showed a decrease in ct utilization in recent years in the pediatric emergency department of a regional pediatric referral center devries et al 11 evaluated ct utilization patterns in children with recurrent headache and reported overuse of head ct despite existing guidelines however limited data are available to describe contemporary trends in the utilization of pediatric cardiac ct and catheterizations the aim of this investigation is to study the impact of cardiac ct on the utilization of cardiac catheterization among children with congenital heart diseases in a tertiary referral general hospital paper_id 66ebbf141431d784fb5f8887c6e840777504b868 Title Trends in the utilization of computedtomography and cardiac catheterization among childrenwith congenital heart disease Abstract backgroundpurpose pediatric cardiac computed tomography ct is a noninvasive imaging modality used to clearly demonstrate the anatomical detail of congenital heart diseases we investigated the impact of cardiac ct on the utilization of cardiac catheterization among children with congenital heart disease methods the study sample consisted of 2648 cardiac ct and 3814 cardiac catheterization from 1999 to 2009 for congenital heart diseases diagnoses were categorized into 11 disease groups the numbers of examination according to the different modalities were compared using temporal trend analyses the estimated effective radiation doses msv of ct and catheterization were calculated and compared results the number of ct scans and interventional catheterizations had a slight annual increase of 12 and 27 respectively whereas that of diagnostic catheterization decreased by 62 per year disease groups fell into two categories according to utilization trend differences between ct and diagnostic catheterization the increased use of ct reduces the need for diagnostic catheterization in patients with atrioventricular connection disorder coronary arterial disorder great vessel disorder septal disorder tetralogy of fallot and ventriculoarterial connection disorder clinicians choose either catheterization or ct or both examinations depending on clinical conditions in patients with semilunar valvular disorder heterotaxy myocardial disorder pericardial disorder and pulmonary vein disorder the radiation dose of ct was lower than that of diagnostic cardiac catheterization in all age groups conclusion the use of noninvasive ct in children with selected heart conditions might reduce the use of diagnostic cardiac catheterization this may release time and facilities within the catheterization laboratory to meet the increasing demand for cardiac interventions Abstract_Summary Background Purpose Pediatric cardiaccomputed tomography CT is a noninvasive imagingmodality used to clearly demonstrate the anatomicaldetail of congenital heart diseases. jpg raw true After embedding is done we

pervasive feeling of invincibility to the point that people and organizations do not believe that disasters can strike them this has impact on the level of preparedness for disasters this study aims to delve into how korea has to change its governmental policiespractices with some private partners efforts to mitigate disaster risks a case study was utilized as the major methodology by comparing exclusive management with inclusive management these two approaches have been comparatively analyzed via four variables namely the central government the local governments the incident commander and other stakeholders the major finding is that koreas practices and policies have to evolve from the current exclusive management into futureoriented inclusive management moreover the importance of communication cooperation collaboration and multidiscipline coordination is discussed additionally the problem of reductionism and equal participation among all stakeholders as well as the resistance from vested interests are recognized and elaborated for korea and the international community Abstract_Summary In Korea there is a pervasive feeling ofinvincibility to the point that people and
