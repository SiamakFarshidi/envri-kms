Let s find out here if any of these factors presence was related to the life of the passengers If you like my kernel do Upvote as that keeps me motivated Any scope of improvement comments would really help. As we can see there are few outliers in Age attribute also it is positive skewed we shall use median to fill the missing values. For example running this by clicking run or pressing Shift Enter will list all files under the input directory Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output. Majority of the passengers belonged to third class but they did not survive the maximum passengers survived from the 1st class when compared to the rest. Survival by Sex Survival by Pclass Survival by Embarkation 0 Not Survived 1 Survived Look at survival rate by sex Survival rate by sex and class sns. We can also recall from the movie females children were given 1st preference while loading on a life boat this statistics proves it. Survival rate of passengers embarking from Cherbourg almost above 50 irrespective of the gender. Clearly survival chances of males is very low when compared to females. PS It uses a lot of RAM import pandas_profiling as pp pp. 8 which is still lower than the survival chances of females in 3rd class which is 50 Survival rate of 1st class is higher than 60 irrespective of the gender. 6 Highest survival chances in males is 80 who belong to 1st class infants teenagers Survival chances of males belonging to 18 30 age group from 2nd class is almost negliable only 2. 4 could survive which is not even the half of the passengers Visualize the count of survivers using columns Sex Pclass Embarked 1. describe isnull. read_csv Input data files are available in the. We did see earlier that some passengers were travelling at 0 pounds as well passengers who paid more than 100 pounds belong to 1st class DATA MANUPULATION Deleting columns which are of no use Check for missing values Out of 891 records in Training set there are missing values in Age Cabin and Embarked and Out of 418 records in Test set there are missing values in Age Fare and Cabin Let s see if there are any outliers in the Age feature in Training set Let s see if there are any outliers in the Age feature in Test set Filling Age missing values of training test data http set with Median We can see majority of passengers borded from Southampton but we saw earlier the survival rate of Cherbourg is high so we would fill the missing values with Cherbourg. DATA EXPLORATION Get some statistical information If we ignore the passenger id we can see all other features are on the same scale except AGE you can remove the passenger id before doing this Some observations that we can make 1. 8 Survival rate of males overall is very less survival of males in 1st class is 36. We can see there are few outliers in the test data set also so we shall fill this with Median As we saw earlier also in the graph Fill NAN of Embarked in training set with S Fill Missing Values for Cabin in training set with 0 Train Set Test Set 1 If alone 0 if it has family members Checkin the row were there is misisng value for Fare Considering the other features filling the NAN value of Fare accordingly Remove few more columns Print the unique values of the categorical columns Split the titanic_train data set into features x label y Splitting the data set into 80 Training 20 Testing Scaling titanic_test data set as well Logistic Regression SVC Linear SVC RBF Decision Tree Classifier Random Forest Classifier Printing accuracy for every model Get and Train all the models Creating confusion matrix and see the accuracy for all the models for test data Extract the confusion matrix parameters Get Important Features for Random Forest Visualize the important features Printing the prediction of Random Forest Printing the actual values. 4 which is still way higher than the adult males of 2nd class i. Titanic was a unprecedented event and was a very controversial topic that had this accident could have been prevented or not. Southampton has a lion s share when it comes to boarding on the ship but they could not defeat the survival. The oldest person on the ship was 80 years old. Some Inferences from the above table Interesting females from 2nd class of infants teenagers have a surival rate of 100 A female who is 30yrs and above belongs to 1st class then the chances of survival is 98 Survival rate of adult females from 3rd class is 30. Here we analyse that factors like Age Gender Boarding Stations Class had any correlation with the survival. And few like Major Capt etc replace them with others Converting categorical variable Sex Embarked Title to numeric values for both the data sets. This can also be done after spliting the dataset into train test however it can also be done before it. The highest fare of the ship was 512 might be British Pounds Out of the total passengers travelling in titanic only 38. It raised a lot of questions in statisticians mind that did the survival of the passengers depend on the any factors. Here we see that the youngest person on the ship was 5 months old i. ProfileReport titanic_train Train set For submission Test set Checking for outliers helps to decide what should be used Mean or Media to fill NAN values. Filling Cabin missing values of training set Filling Cabin missing values of test set Creating new variable Family Size Alone As there is just 1 missing value of Fare in Test data set we can fill it using Mean or Median Extract Title from name column we can replace a few titles like there is Ms which can be replaced with Miss as they refer to the same gender group.
