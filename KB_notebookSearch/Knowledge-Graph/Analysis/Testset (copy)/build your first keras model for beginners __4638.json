Epoch One pass through all of the rows in the training dataset. compile the keras model fit the keras model on dataset evaluate the keras model making a prediction on training dataset as consider we have not seen it before round the prediction. We will use the rectified linear unit activation function referred to as ReLU on the first two layers and the Sigmoid function in the output layer. This can be specified when creating the first layer with the input_dim argument and setting it to 8 for the 8 input variables. Step 7 Making Predictionsmaking a prediction is a simple task using a predict. This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed It is defined by the kaggle python Docker image https github. We can specify the number of neurons or nodes in the layer as the first argument and specify the activation function using the activation argument. The first thing to get right is to ensure the input layer has the right number of input features. Models is keras are defined as Sequence of layers So we difine a sequential model and add layers one at a time untill we are happy with our network architecture. We can easily convert them into a crisp binary prediction for this classification task by rounding them. We want to train the model enough so that it learns a good or good enough mapping of rows of input data to the output classification. com kaggle docker python For example here s several helpful packages to load linear algebra data processing CSV file I O e. We can piece it all together by adding each layer The model expects rows of data with 8 variables input_dim 8 First hidden layer has the 12 neurons and activation function as Relu Second hidden layer has the 8 neurons and activation function as Relu. We have done this for simplicity when you are solving any rel world problem statement you will split data into train and test set. we can train model with the loaded data by the help of fit Training occurs over epochs and each epoch is split into batches. We can evaluate out model on train set using the evaluate func and pass it the same input and output to train the model. The model will always have some error but the amount of error will level out after some point for a given model configuration. For this problem we will run for a small number of epochs 150 and use a relatively small batch size of 10. Fully connected layers are defined using the Dense class. The evaluate function will return a list with two values. This is called model convergence. Batch One or more samples considered by the model within an epoch before weights are updated. The output layer has one node and uses the sigmoid activation function. Step 3 Compile the Keras ModelCompiling the model uses the efficient numerical libraries under the covers the so called backend such as Theano or TensorFlow. input directory For example running this by clicking run or pressing Shift Enter will list all files under the input directory You can write up to 20GB to the current directory kaggle working that gets preserved as output when you create a version using Save Run All You can also write temporary files to kaggle temp but they won t be saved outside of the current session first split the data into input X and oyput Y variables. In this case we will use cross entropy as the loss argument. Step 5 Evaluate the ModelNow that we have trained the model and we can evaluate to know the performance that how well our model performed. Training the network means finding the best set of weights to map inputs to outputs in our dataset. read_csv Input data files are available in the read only. Please upvote it it gives huge motivation and appciate to create new notebooks and ace a journey forward towards the data scientist. when compiling we must specify some additional properties while training the network. The backend automatically chooses the best way to represent the network for training and making predictions to run on your hardware such as CPU or GPU or even distributed. We are only interested in reporting the accuracy so we will ignore the loss value. This will generate a prediction for each input and output pair and collect scores including the average loss and any metrics you have configured such as accuracy. one epoch is comprised of moe or more batches based on chosen batch_size and model fit for many epochs. Parameters we must specify the loss function to use to evaluate the set of weights optimizer is used to search through different weights for the network and any optional metrics we would like to collect and report during training. define keras model and add layers with activatin func as discussed. This loss is for a binary classification problems and is defined in Keras as binary_crossentropy. In this notebook we will implement a fully connnected network structure with 3 layers. You can learn more about choosing loss functions based on your problem here Step 4 Fit the ModelNow we have compiled our model successfully and ready to fit the data. Alternately we can call the predict_classes function on the model to predict crisp classes directly for example Thank You. The first will be the loss of the model on the dataset and the second will be the accuracy of the model on the dataset. we are using a sigmoid activation function in output layer so prediction will be probability between 0 and 1. These configurations can be chosen experimentally by trial and error.
