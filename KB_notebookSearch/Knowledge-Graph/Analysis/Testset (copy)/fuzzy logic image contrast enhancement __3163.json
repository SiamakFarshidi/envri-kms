This project aims at developing a new FuzzyInference System to enhance the contrast of theimages overcoming the shortcomings of the traditional methods. Intensity in 0 255 Inference Calculate the output fuzzy set from the input pixel intensity based on the proposed rule set Defuzzification For each pixel calculate centroid value of its output fuzzy set. Rule Set IF input is VeryDark THEN output is ExtremelyDark IF input is Dark THEN output is VeryDark IF input is SlightlyDark THEN output is Dark IF input is SlightlyBright THEN output is Bright IF input is Bright THEN output is VeryBright IF input is VeryBright THEN output is ExtremelyBright 4. org ftp arxiv papers 1809 1809. The most popular method is histogram equalization which is based on the assumption that a uniformly distributed grayscale histogram will have the best visual contrast Other advanced histogram based enhancement methods include bi histogram equalization BHE block overlapped histogram equalization multi scale adaptive histogram equalization shape preserving local histogram modification etc. 015 Gaussian Function Membership Functions Calculate degree of membership for each class Fuzzy Inference Calculate AggregatedFuzzySet Calculate crisp value of centroid Proposed fuzzy method Convert RGB to LAB Get L channel Calculate M value Precompute the fuzzy transform Apply the transform to l channel Min max scale the output L channel to fit 0 255 Convert LAB to RGB Traditional method of histogram equalization Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization. Results obtained using both the approaches are compared. png Description Convert input image from RGB to CIELAB progress on L channel Calculate the average pixel intensity M value Fuzzification For each pixel calculate degree of membership of each class based on pixel intensity and M value. png attachment image.

Introduction Image enhancement is a method of improving thequality of an image and contrast is a major aspect. Traditionalmethods of contrast enhancement like histogram equalizationresults in over under enhancement of the image especially alower resolution one.
