MGMT_value is the label where 1 stands for presence and 0 for absence of MGMT in the given subjectThe current dataset does not suffer from data imbalance problem since there is a very small difference between the count of the samples of the two classes. The current competition requires to predict the genetic subtype of glioblastoma using MRI scans to train and test model to detect the presence of MGMT. More data does not always mean better model. jpeg attachment c3143f99 2611 4202 8b22 637afd7bf1cf. There can different variants but the current dataset includes Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery FLAIR T1 weighted pre contrast T1w T1 weighted post contrast T1Gd T2 weighted T2 image. But there are irrelevant noisy data which worsens the trainnig. The main objective is to map the internal body structures which are hidden by the skin and bones. png attachment 6c5e796a 7a5b 446d 893c a045c2ae7c99. Import Modules Analysis of the given MRI dataset The train folder consists of sub folders which are the independent cases represented by a five digit number. jpeg These different categories are mostly due to the ability of MR scanners to gather information depending on the pulse sequence. Image Visualization Showing some sample images and its label for each subject Data Loader Network Architecture Training Inference Submission. As the nuclei is relieved an RF energy is emitted which is measured. Each one differ by intensity which represents different tissues. NOTE NUM_SAMPLES is not batch size consider it as equivalent to frames in a video data. In the current MRI classification the initial and last time stamps consists of many complete black frames and small blobs which does not help in prediction. png Working Methodology Our body is made up of water molecules. Further an external RF signal is used for the perturbation of this alignment. Structural multi parametric MRI mpMRI MP MRI an important type of MRI which creates a more informative picture compared to a single MRI since it combines different types of images. This condition assumes images with the highest average has full slice of brain image leading to better model training. This is important as we can not exceed beyond these values while building the input data for the given network architecture. Basics of Magnetic Resonance Imaging MRI MRI is an important diagnostic tool for visulaizing the soft tissues of the body. The above analysis show that the minimum total image count for a given subject taking into account all the variants is 80 for train and 92 for test. RSNA MICCAI Brain Tumor Radiogenomic Classification Glioblastoma is a malignant tumor in the brain which is the most common form of brain cancer in adults and with the worst prognosis. This helps in diagnosis and proper treatment without a need of an external surgery for analysis. This also helps in preventing errors while building the input data for training. MRI use a powerful magnetic field to align the protons of the water molecules of the tissues which are otherwise randomly orientated. For each case four sub folder exists which correspond to each of the structural multi parametric MRI scans in DICOM format. These frequency signals are converted using Fourier transform for further analysis. Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine DICOM A de facto standard format with a set of well defined rules used for storing and transmitting medical images. Filter Irrelevant Data As shared in different notebooks the dataset with ids 109 123 709 are redundant hence they are removed using the following code. For training for a single subject images from all the variants are taken to build a dataset of the form of NUM_SAMPLES IMG_SIZE IMG_SIZE where NUM_SAMPLES 64. For a given input data only the top 64 frames all 4 variants are used which has highest average pixel intensity. Adding Metadata Additional Informations like count of images of all the variants which are useful for stastical analysis is added to the previous dataframe. A specific genetic sequence in the tumor known as MGMT promoter methylation is a favorable prognostic factor. png comparison t2 clinical t1 basics original. Hyperparameters Feature Engineering When using a black box tool like Deep Learning it is generally left to the model to extract the important features from the dataset and predict the relevant class.
