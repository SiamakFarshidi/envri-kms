However just using average rating of the moives is not a very good way because it cannot take popularity and audience s amount into consideration. Build up Recommendation Model Provide Recommendations Conclusion Popularity Recommendation System Content Based Recommendation System Collaborative Filtering Recommendation System User to User ImprovementSeems that the best way to provide recommendations is to combine these three types of systems and give comprehensive suggestions. Therefore I used another way to give every movie a score. I will apply TF IDF to genre and you can find more introduction about TF IDF in my Github https github. Recommendation SystemIn this notebook I explored three kinds of recommendation popularity content based and colaborative filter recommendations. Anytime one customer inputs a movie s name the system will provide him or her with 10 possible movies that are similar to the one customer chooses. ipynb Data Processing Provide Recommendations Collaborative Filtering Recommendation System Exploratory Data AnalysisSince the rating data has more than seven million lines I just selected fifty thousands to show the function of colaborative filtering system. com Zhenyu0521 Text Analysis blob master NLP 20for 20Yelp 20Reviews NLP_for_Yelp_Reviews. Remove null values 1 Show detailed information about those most popular movies Calculate cosine similarities just take user1 for example. The Simplest Recommendation SystemFor the most direct recommendation we can just find the most popular movies and it is probably that most of the people will like them. Ingest 1 means people didn t give the movies they have seen ratings. The final result should be that anytime our customers input one movie s name the system can provide them the other most possible movies they want to watch. It needs me to spend much more time to find a proper method to combine them and get better model.
