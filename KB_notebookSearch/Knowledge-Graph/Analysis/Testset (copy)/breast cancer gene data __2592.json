Each variable in the data set is represented by a column of rectangles where each rectangle corresponds to a discrete value taken on by that variable.

The relative heights of the rectangles reflect the relative frequency of occurrence of the corresponding value. com dharineeshk Accuracy 82 fixing custom colors based on the aesthetic of this notebook Prediction Scores.

BREAST CANCER GENE DATA cancer cancer https www. Breast cancer survival rates have increased and the number of deaths associated with this disease is steadily declining largely due to factors such as earlier detection a new personalized approach to treatment and a better understanding of the disease. Substantial support for breast cancer awareness and research funding has helped created advances in the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. After skin cancer breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in women in the United States.
