Nondemented at the time of their initial visit and were subsequently characterized as Demented at a later visit. Brain Imaging via magnetic resonance imaging MRI is used for evaluation of patients with suspected AD. However in order to reach that stage clinicians and researchers will have to make use of machine learning techniques that can accurately predict progress of a patient from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. 3 Logistic Regression using SGD 6. 64 of the subjects were grouped as Demented at the time of their initial visits and remained so throughout the study. The dataset consists of a longitudinal MRI data of 150 subjects aged 60 to 96. We guess patients who suffered from that kind of disease has lower survival rate so that there are a few of 90 years old.

DETECTING EARLY ALZHEIMER S USING MRI DATA AND MACHINE LEARNING Problem Statement Alzheimer s disease AD is a neurodegenerative disorder of uncertain cause and pathogenesis that primarily affects older adults and is the most common cause of dementia. The earliest clinical manifestation of AD is selective memory impairment and while treatments are available to ameliorate some symptoms there is no cure currently available. 1 Logistic Regression MLE with Scaled Features 5. Logistic Regression LogisticReg 5. 72 of the subjects were grouped as Nondemented throughout the study. Data Analysis and Preparation We see that there are 373 observations and 12 features we have changed the values of Gender to 0 1 we have changed the targer value to 0 1 we have dropped the MRI ID Visit Hand columns The above graph indicates that men are more likely with dementia than women The chart shows Nondemented group got much more higher MMSE scores than Demented group. This is assumed to be because the diseases affect the brain to be shrinking its tissue. From the above graph demented patients have less MMSE and Non Demented patients have more MMSE value. Decision Tree DecisionTree 6. 2 Prune the Decision Tree 6. There are some null values in SES The data is well Balanced 5. 1 Decision Tree 6. MRI findings include both local and generalized shrinkage of brain tissue. Support Vector Machine using GridSearchCV and Regularization 9.

Nondemented group has higher brain volume than Demented group. 2 Logistic Regression using SGD usingSGD 6. 2 Prune a Decision Tree DecisionTreePruning 6.

Import Libraries 2. Each subject was scanned at least once. These fall under the Converted category. 3 Decision Tree using GridSearchCV DecisionTreewithGridSearchCv 7. Some studies have suggested that MRI features may predict rate of decline of AD and may guide therapy in the future. Generally the MMSE indicates value less than 24 indicates Abnormality which implies the observations are true as the MMSE Metrics The above graph indicates that almost half of the patients visiting for the first time are detected with Alzhimers Intermediate Result Summary Men are more likely with demented an Alzheimer s Disease than Women. Logistic Regression 5. There is a higher concentration of 70 80 years old in the Demented patient group than those in the nondemented patients. We propose to develop a sound model that can help clinicians do that and predict early alzheimer s. Read Data RD 4. DATASET DESCRIPTION We will be using the longitudinal MRI data.
