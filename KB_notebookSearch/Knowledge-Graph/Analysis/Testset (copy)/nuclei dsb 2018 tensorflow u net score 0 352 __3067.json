False positives and false negatives. Use augmented data. In case you want to reload and preprocess the raw data. For the task we implement a deep neural network of the U Net type consisting of several convolutional and max pooling layers. Merge all summaries. Note that the score is better than the true score since overlapping touching nuclei can not be separately identified in this version. randint len x_test Create submission file. It should be noted that the background can be dark black as as well as light white. len x_batch Evaluate current loss and score Store losses and scores. Loop over each object excluding the background labeled by 0. Create and start training of a new model. Each mask has at least one identified object. The pixels are one indexed and numbered from top to bottom then left to right 1 is pixel 1 1 2 is pixel 2 1 etc. Create and start training of a new neural network or continue training of a pretrained model. For the training images the nuclei are segmented by humans such that we know their number and location within each image.
