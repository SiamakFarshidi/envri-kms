Don t add layers yet. 3 Add the remaining layers1. 1 Start the modelCreate a Sequential model called fashion_model. validation_split 0. solution Your code to fit the model here Check your answer Your code below Don t remove this line ensures comptibility with tensorflow 2. Add your prediction layer to fashion_model. Use this variable when specifying the number of nodes in this layer. It should have 12 filters a kernel_size of 3 and the relu activation function. First comes the data holding the images and second is the data with the class labels to be predicted. You ll now build a model to identify different types of clothing. The change could be using a different number of layers different number of convolutions in the layers etc. You will see validation accuracies after each epoch. Specify the following arguments 1. The activation should be softmax or you will have problems later. Set up code checking Your Code Here Check your answer Your code here Check your answer q_2. Add 2 more convolutional Conv2D layers with 20 filters each relu activation and a kernel size of 3. We have saved the number of rows and columns to the variables img_rows and img_cols respectively so the input shape in this case is img_rows img_cols 1. metrics accuracy 5 Fit The ModelRun the command fashion_model. The arguments you will use are1. 0 Check your answer. 6 Create A New ModelCreate a new model called second_fashion_model in the cell below. The first layer always requires that you specify the input_shape. The data used to fit the model. We alrady have a variable called num_classes. optimizer adam 3. Follow that with a Flatten layer and then a Dense layer with 100 neurons. com dansbecker dropout and strides for larger models which become important as you start using bigger and more powerful models. com learn deep learning for computer vision course. com learn forum 161321 to chat with other Learners. 4 Compile Your ModelCompile fashion_model with the compile method. solution Your code to compile the model in this cell Check your answer q_4. Make some changes so it is different than fashion_model that you ve trained above. 2 Add the first layerAdd the first Conv2D layer to fashion_model. com dansbecker deep learning from scratch. png Data PreparationThis code is supplied and you don t need to change it. Define the model compile it and fit it in the cell below. Keep GoingYou are ready to learn about strides and dropout https www. This notebook is an exercise in the Deep Learning for Computer Vision https www. As an example your model will take an images like this and identify it as a shoe Imgur https i. 2 When you run this command you can watch your model start improving. hint Your code here Check your answer q_3. loss categorical_crossentropy 2. IntroductionYou ve seen how to build a model from scratch to identify handwritten digits. Just run the cell below. Have questions or comments Visit the Learn Discussion forum https www. This is a Dense layer. Look at the first code cell which was supplied to you where we called prep_data to find the variable names for these. You can reference the tutorial at this link https www. To make models that train quickly we ll work with very small low resolution images.
