For reasons that will be explained below I will not use the label extrahls but instead will classify everything as either 0 artifact 1 normal extrahls or 2 murmur. Even being more generous than that most would agree that extra heart sounds are rarer and less important than murmurs by an order of magnitude. Or maybe I ll move on to PhysioNet. Similarly I would have preferred if the artifact examples were less bizarre. And upvote if you used the labels yourself. 101 107 115 116 122 should be murmur. First the artifacts These were all correctly classified. Another problem is that many of these examples are too extreme to be helpful for any practical screening applications. We finish this by printing our label in a format that can be easily imported to another notebook. They are called grade 5 or 6 murmurs when you can feel them on the skin or hear them anywhere on the chest. The first heart sound is generated by the closure of the inflow valves mitralis and tricuspid and marks the beginning of systole when blood is pushed out to from the heart to the body and lungs. A person with a murmur like 83 or 88 either has well known cardiac disease or needs to be sent to hospital straight away. Instead I believe many of them are a split second sound which is created when the aortic and pulmonary valves don t close exactly at the same time. I ve tried both and keeping their label works better with my CNN. I ll be back when I ve analysed set B. Especially during systole it can be a normal finding created by the high speed flow in aorta. This is normal when you hold your breath but can sometimes be a sign of lung disease. More problematic is that many recordings under normal had similar extra sounds and I think that these in many cases are caused by the recording technique which is after all different from ear to chest on which third heart sounds were defined. As the category extrahls therefore seems to be poorly defined I decided to combine it with normal. They have been described from the beginning of days from the time when the stethoscope wasn t invented and doctors listened with ear to chest. I had a network model up and running and just wanted to add labels to the unclassified files. In the end I decided that it would not have been worth the effort. com toregil d kinguistics heartbeat sounds what s in a heartbeat. We will see that our model will struggle to identify the much more common milder murmurs and many more examples of this would have been needed. And yes I know changing data post hoc this way is fishy but I m not publishing this. I am doctor and I still use my stethoscope once in a while but I m not an expert by far. While preparing for this I found that I didn t agree with the labels of many of the already classified files so I made new labels for the whole set. Some of the recordings under extrahls do indeed have extra sounds but I am not sure that they correspond to the classical third and fourth sound especially as an extra peak is not seen on the amplitude graph. Load the data Look and listen at the four classesI will now go through the training set and relabel the data points. I have certainly never based any clinical decision on their presence or not. A third or forth heart sound is thought to be due to abnormal blood flow in the ventricles and is a sign of advanced heart disease. My experience from med school is that extra heart sounds don t really exist any more at least not outside of cardiac surgery. 132 134 141 and 150 have heartbeats but also a lot of noise so could be classified either way. There are actually some heart beats on 18 and 23 so they could be classified either way. Some are obvious like chatter in Italian or a Bollywood song from the radio. When a faint extra sound was found on the wards it was mandatory for everyone to go there and listen and sometimes the sound we heard was imagined rather than real. In some cases there are extra heart sounds murmurs and artifacts on the same recording and it could be given a triple score for this. In addition 40 and 55 which are murmur. I think I ll compose a rant for the forum about the difficulties of using human perception as gold standard and then move on to other datasets. Please check out my other notebook 1 where I apply a deep convolutional net to these labels achieving 80 90 accuracy after a few minutes of training. I chose normal for 141 and artifact for the others. If you listen to these normal recordings you will realize why I felt that the border between normal and extrahls is very fuzzy indeed. Number 168 169 and 170 are probably from the same patient. Some medical backgroundThe two heart sounds S1 S2 or lub dub are generated when the valves of the heart close. Most of these are correct but as mentioned above 66 is identical with 55 and 62 63 65 68 seem to be normal rhythm with some irregular noise rather than murmur. Please feel free to add corrections suggestions on this. In fact 55 is identical to 66 below which was labelled murmur. I went back and forth between recordings a few times but the distinction did not become any clearer for me. The second heart sound is generated by the closure of the outflow valves aortic and pulmonary and marks the beginning of diastole the slightly longer phase when the heart is refilled. A murmur can also be a sign of malfunction of the valves such as stenosis when the valve is too narrow and tight or insufficiency when there is leakage over a valve that fails to close. A heart murmur is a low frequency sound created by turbulent flow over the valves. In conclusion I have removed the EHS category and discovered quite a few mild murmurs among the other classes. I thought about going one step further and use the fact that these classes are not really exclusive.
