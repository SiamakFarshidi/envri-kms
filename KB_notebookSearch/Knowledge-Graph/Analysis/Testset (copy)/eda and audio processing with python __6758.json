Let us study about few of the features in detail. SpectrogramA spectrogram is a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies of sound or other signals as they vary with time. It represents the frequency below which a specified percentage of the total spectral energy e. The remaining recordings with some exclusions has been published as datasets split in two by first alphabet due to Kaggle s 20GB size limitation http www. airplane overflights or other bird and non bird e. Understanding the Evaluation MetricThe metric in this competition is the row wise micro averaged F1 score. However the recordings are complex and may contain anthropogenic sounds e. We can also resample the audio sample to 44. We can display a spectrogram using. org species amecro for the American Crow. The vertical axis shows frequencies from 0 to 10kHz and the horizontal axis shows the time of the clip. A typical audio signal can be expressed as a function of Amplitude and Time. org species such as https ebird. Properties of an audio signalAn audio signal is represented in the form of an audio signal having parameters such as frequency bandwidth decibel etc. Since we see that all action is taking place at the bottom of the spectrum we can convert the frequency axis to a logarithmic one. chipmunk calls in the background with a particular labeled bird species in the foreground. Consider two songs one from a blues genre and the other belonging to metal. ObjectiveIt is often easier to hear birds than see them. However we must extract the characteristics that are relevant to the problem we are trying to solve. It is important to note that only the first three rows are available for download the full test. Let us calculate the zero crossing rate for our example audio clip. Let s check out a few RecordistRecordist is the user who provided the recordings. Spectral RolloffIt is a measure of the shape of the signal. png DataFollowing files have been provided to the participants train_audio Trainign data consisting of short recordings train_csv metadata for training data test_audio The hidden test set audio consists of approximately 150 recordings in mp3 format each roughly 10 minutes long. com presentation d 1zzgNu_HbKL2iPkHS8 qhtDV20QfWt9lC3ZwPVZo8Rw0 pub start false loop false delayms 3000 slide id. When the data is represented in a 3D plot they may be called waterfalls. Since external data is allowed in the competition it can prove to be highly beneficial during the training part. In 2 dimensional arrays the first axis is frequency while the second axis is time. 1KHz by Or we can simply disable sampling by Playing Audio IPython. The process of extracting features to use them for analysis is called feature extraction. com rohanrao xeno canto bird recordings extended n zPlease read this discussion post https www. sr stands for Sample Rate which is the number of samples of audio carried per second measured in Hz or kHz. The F score is defined as the weighted harmonic mean of the test s precision and recall. g5a7a9806e_0_84These sounds are available in many formats which makes it possible for the computer to read and analyse them. Some examples are mp3 format WMA Windows Media Audio format wav Waveform Audio File format Loading an audio fileI ll be using a Python Library called Librosa for analysing the audio file. Improving the accuracy of soundscape analyses. The objective of the competition as stated on the competitions page is to identify a wide variety of bird vocalizations in soundscape recordings. Mel Frequency Cepstral CoefficientsThe Mel frequency cepstral coefficients MFCCs of a signal are a small set of features usually about 10 20 which concisely describe the overall shape of a spectral envelope. With proper sound detection and classification researchers could automatically intuit factors about an area s quality of life based on a changing bird population. png source https docs. Spectral CentroidIt indicates where the centre of mass for a sound is located and is calculated as the weighted mean of the frequencies present in the sound. Ratings Date of recordings Countries where recordings have been made Species Distribution of Recorded Species Additional DatasetsIt is interesting to note here the amount of training recordings per species has been limited to 100 to keep the dataset at a reasonable. The F1 score or F measure is a measure of a test s accuracy. This returns an audio time series as a numpy array with a default sampling rate sr of 22KHZ mono. com rohanrao xeno canto bird recordings extended a mhttp www. Clearly the additional recordings in red has far more observations than existing data. csv is in the hidden test set. Exploring the Training metadataTo begin with let s explore the training metadata file to gather some informationThe file contains a lot of columns but we shall focus on some of the ones which are directly related to our problem e bird codea code for the bird species. com max 1400 1 akRbhl8739UEDuKHkOUR1Q. read_csv Preprocessing Visualisation libraries Settings for pretty nice plots Total number of people who provided the recordings Top 10 recordists in terms of the number of recordings done Convert string to datetime64 Total no of unique species in the dataset Plot the total recordings Plot the original recordings Add a legend and informative axis label Zooming in Computing the time variable for visualization Normalising the spectral centroid for visualisation Plotting the Spectral Centroid along the waveform Displaying the MFCCs. com c birdsong recognition discussion 159970 for more information. Here we have the plot of the amplitude envelope of a waveform. Here mfcc computed 20 MFCC s over 1062 frames. Spectrograms are sometimes called sonographs voiceprints or voicegrams. You can review detailed information about the bird codes by appending the code to https ebird. We can also perform feature scaling such that each coefficient dimension has zero mean and unit variance linear algebra data processing CSV file I O e. It models the characteristics of the human voice. csv metadata for test set. Playback_usedWhether playback has been used or not. Analysing the external datasetsThe original train data has 21 375 recordings and the extended train data has an additional 22 015 recordings for 253 out of 264 species which more than doubles the training data size. Visualizing AudioWe can plot the audio array using librosa. the rate at which the signal changes from positive to negative or back. com rohanrao has been kind enough to extract them and share them in usable form with the community. Audio lets you play audio directly in a jupyter notebook. However external dataset is available and Rohan Rao https www. Feature extractionEvery audio signal consists of many features. Zero Crossing RateThe zero crossing rate is the rate of sign changes along a signal i.
