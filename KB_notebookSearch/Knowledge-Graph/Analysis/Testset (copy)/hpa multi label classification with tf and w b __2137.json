Here are some of my other kernels. Get Train Val Split from saved W B Artifact Augmentation using Albumentations Visualize Batch Model Callbacks Train with W B Save Model as Artifacts image. My input data pipeline initially took approx 50 minutes per epoch when I was loading images channels separately and then stacking them. ly play with segmentation masks If you like the work upvote for encouragement. HPA Segmentation Mask Visualization with W B https www. The idea is to experiment few techniques before leveraging weak supervision for instance segmentation. Using EfficientNetB0 with input image size 256x256. Ref https www. Set Hyperparameters Prepare tf. Install Weights and Biases. I am also using Weights and Biases W B in this kernel to store train validation split as artifacts. IncludesThis Kaggle kernel will document my primary exploits for this competition. data DataloaderThe train. Here s a short report summarizing the result http bit. There are a total of 21 806 training images. Let s discuss ideas in the comment section. Set the random seeds RGB images of size 256x256. Apply augmentation policies. com tensorflow tensorflow issues 16044 convert the compressed string to a 3D uint8 tensor Normalize image resize the image to the desired size Load image Parse label Define the augmentation policies. RGB 512x512 Dataset Creation Versioning with W B https www. com ayuraj hpa segmentation mask visualization with w b In this kernel I am attempting to understand the use of HPA Cell Segmentation tool provided by the competition hosts. png attachment image. Key features Simple to follow along code. png Work In Progress Stay Tuned. csv holds ID for the training images and image level labels. By using an already stacked image the ETA per epoch is approx 3 mins. Imports for augmentations. Here I am trying to train an simple multi label image classifier. Binary crossentropy as loss function. Note that they are applied sequentially with some probability p. Early stopping regularization monitoring val_auc. com divyanshuusingh eda image segmentation Ref https github. Consume training CSV Training Dataset Validation Dataset Training batch Validation batch Initialize model Compile model Initialize W B run Train Close W B run Add a file to the artifact s contents Save the artifact version to W B and mark it as the output of this run. I am also using W B s interactive visualization to play with the segmentation masks that are logged. com ayuraj hpa512x512dataset I used this kernel to build RGB dataset of size 512x512 pixels. Setups Installations and ImportsWe will use Weights and Biases for experiment tracking. I am leaving out the yellow channel for now.
