{"name": "kaggle 2021 community bias finding most popular ", "full_name": " h1 Kaggle 2021 community bias h1 A Look At The Data h1 The Subgroup ", "stargazers_count": 0, "forks_count": 0, "description": "In traditional jobs like a software engineer or business analyst the bias in terms of compensation is much higher when compared to jobs like a data scientist. For instance people with 3 4 years of machine learning experience were earning more than those with 3 5 years of programming experince. Women statisticians program project manager data engineer dba database engineer were mostly earning more than men in 2021. A lot more analysis is possible. This is based in count. Similarly negative growth can be seen from 2018 to 2019 for respondents aged upto around 35 years. But the second most popular in case of men in 2021 is visual studio code. plot_multi_column It can take two dataframe with list of preference columns eg. . Even in 2020 the situation seems to be pretty much same. While AWS overall seems to be more popular women product managers statisticians and research scientist prefer google cloud platform over AWS. Kaggle 2021 community biasThis is the second analytics challenge I am participating on kaggle. Where as preferences like language IDE and computing platform can tell how the overall industry has shaped over the years. As it can be seen yearly compensation had droped from 2019 to 2020. A look at the count based on gender tells how a drop in number of male respondents aged from around 23 to 35 years contributed to an overall drop in number of respondents from 2019 to 2020. The first one being Solving complex issues with simple vizualizations which did not impress many. Where as in industries like miltary medical pharmaceutical broadcasting communications more men respondents were from a higher age group. I have used data from previous surveys. But lets look at the data further in order to understand our community better and how it has has evolved. Compensation has increased more with machine learning experience in comparision to programming experience. I have used the class plot_data which has the following functions to plot the details are explained in the code plot_column_cat_multi It can plot data using two dataframes eg. In most industries there is a similarity in common age groups for men and women. Respondents aged between 23 to 35 years were more in number in 2019 than 2020. Also while for some age group research scientist is a common title for women it is not for men. As the questionnaire has changed frequently I was able to use the previous data only for the most common questions. Using line and horizontal bar graph I have reflected upon the change that has come over the previous years within the community. For instance in shipping transportation while most men do not use machine learning methods most women respondents have been exploring machine learning methods. Similarly in online bussiness internet based sales while more men responded for well established ml methods women have recently started using ml methods. In marketing crm men are using well established method while women are not using ml methos. Colab notebook is the most popular in 2021 except for few age group as 35 39 years. Till now you would have guessed that this story is about the female kaggle community. It can be said that data science jobs are more fruitful for women than men. Yearly compensation has increased for both men and women as machine and programming experience increases. It does support the fact that as level of automation is progressing jobs like programming might not exist in the furure. 2019 to 2020 saw negative or very less growth for respondents aged 23 to 55 years. All the horizontal bar plots find and plot the most common values after grouping and aggregation. The columns to plot need to be categorical eg age industry. Roles like data engineer research scientist statistician and other have been more fruitful for women than men. But in industries like non profit crm insurance risk assesment more women respondents are from a higher age froup then men. The most common age group based on count or the most popular languages used on regular basis. Respondents aged 35 years and above have increased the most in year 2021 when compared to previous years. A Look At The Data The survey has 42 questions some divided into parts. As per the competition I have tried to come up with a story revolving around a subgroup within the kaggle community. Matlab which was popular among women respondents aged between 25 39 years in 2020 is less popular in 2021 30 34 age group replaced by either java or c. list of languages used on regular basis and a categorical column eg. Again there were more respondents aged between 23 to 35 years in 2018 than 2021. Whereas men software engineer research scientist product managers and business analyst were able to earn more than women. The above graph shows how within the same industry men and women can have different level of relevance for machine learning. Women statisticians product managers and data learning engineers with work experience earn the most. It shows the list of four most popular languages in every age group from 2020 to 2021. But most women respondents prefer java c and matlab where as men have prefered javascipt. But in 2021 c replaced javascript. The above two graphs above support the earlier findings. While in 2020 for age groups above 30 34 years most common title for women was either other or currently unemployed. Retail sales online services manufacturing fabrication hospitality entertainment sports government public service and energy mining are the industries where women are more often earning more than men. Finally from 2020 to 2021 the increase percentage in case of male was much more than female. Finally software engineer was also most popular title for men in age group 45 49 years in 2020 which is not the case for any age group for either men or women. I terms of title the picture was a little different. This could be infered in many ways but in sectors related to information and technology more men are using machine learning. Where as female software engineer increase percentage was more than male during this time. Overall in shipping transportation military security defence and energy mining women are ahead in terms of level of machine learning methods. In 2020 however zeppelin zepl notebook was the most popular among both men and women except for men below 39 years. Lets find out more about our community. Conclusion Kaggle survey includes questions related to most professional aspects but still it is not sufficient to predict the changes in the future for women in data science and machine learning. In military security defence while men are still exploring for ml methods women have already being using ml methods since last two years. Even though there was a global pendamic towards 2020 a drop from 2018 2019 is a surprise. But 2021 count is still not a substantial improvement and in some countries 2018 count is more than 2021. Seems less men are interested in research in data science compared to women. For instance in the age group 25 29 for men in 2020 python sql r and javascript were the top four languages used on regular basis. At the moment few things are clear Though there is a substantial bias against women like in many other industries there is a brighter side too. Information like age country education experiences and title tells about how the community has evolved. Female respondents from 21 to 45 and 49 to 59 have spent more duration of time to complete the survey. Also the decrease from 2018 to 2021 was more significant for number of male respondents aged around 23 to 35 years when compared to female. For women machine learning engineer the most common role is to analyze an understand data whereas for men it is to build prototypes. The above graph is between age groups and languages. Data science is still an unknown domain where many corporations have just joined the market. For instance python sql and r are used on regular basis by all. Most common title for women from 30 44 years is data scientist. I feel the gender bias will only decrease in the comming future. The decrease in number of male data analyst data engineer data scientist research scientist and software engineer from 2019 to 2020 is much more significant than the female. As we can see programming experience for men and women repondents are more than machine learning. As we can see the number of respondents and increase from previous years from many countries decreased from 2018 to 2021. In case of every age group jupyter is most popular IDE. Overall numbers have recovered. In 2021 things have changed drastically. Nigeria have more respondents from computers technology than manufacturing fabrication. In both 2020 and 2021 while more men respondents in age group 25 29 were data scintist most women respondents were students. In case of non professional education like Some college university study without earning a bachelor s degree and No formal education past high school women were earning more than men in 2021. There are not just more opportunities but also there is more growth for people with more experience. For women data engineer common task include build and or run data infrastructure whereas for men it is data analyses. An insight that could be of great help to corporate policy makers. From 2020 to 2021 increase in male data engineer data scientist research scientist was more than female. In industries like shipping transportation military security defence and energy mining where more women were using machine learning methods have one of the lowest percentage of women population. Whereas in countries with lower female percentage like Brazil Japan and Russia manufacturing fabrication has more respondents than computers technology. how compensation has changed with experience over past years. Again miltary and broadcasting communications where women presence is less than men. Countries with higher percentage of female respondents India U. It has been used to plot line graphs and compare data over previous years. But overall men respondents have more work experience. Overall it seems that from 2018 to 2021 when the world was going through a phase of panic and uncertainity kaggle male community was affected more in comparison to female community members. The plot has be used to compare two different sets of data. But from 2020 to 2021 the increase was only for those with 5 years or more of machine learning experience or 3 to 5 years of programming experience. For men the compensation seem to increase from bachelor s master s doctoral to professional doctoral. But for women for some reason it decreases and then remains same. It might be a case where age could be a reason behind discrimination. First overall data science industry has more opportunities for women when compared to the overall IT sector. While most women using machine learning algorithm are working in non IT sectors. for men women or for year 2021 2020. plot_column_cat It can take only one dataframe with both categorical columns eg age ml_relevance plot_column It can take any number of dataframe with one categorical columns and other numerical eg age current_compensation_avg. Apart from the similarities there are some differences in how women have chosen there languages in 2021. Else in case of every professional course men respondents were earning more than women. In case of women it is rstdio from age groups 40 onwards and pycharm from 30 39 years. The Subgroup We can see that like at many other organisations and professional communities the gender bias is quit visible in kaggle 2021 community and there can be many reasons behind that. Also we can see how regular language preference has changed from 2020 2021. While men have used machine leaning methods in online bussiness internet marketing crm broadcasting communication and acounting finance with higher level of relevance.
