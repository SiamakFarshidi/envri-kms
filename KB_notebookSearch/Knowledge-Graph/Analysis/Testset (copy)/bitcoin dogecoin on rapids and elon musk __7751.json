Let s see how the tweets look his progression over time and get an overall feel of how what when he tweets. He was already known before but 2015 got him on a whole new level by announcing Tesla s Powerwall battery and putting out his personal life through his biography. Why is Stationarity Important For data to be stationary the statistical properties of a system do not change over time. Choosing data that is closer This is how the logs look now in our Dashboard Pro Tip If you would like to change something in the W B Graph and you want it to show in the Dashboard simply click Detach at the top after you ve made your changes Use ARIMA to forecast the Future The W B Dashboard https wandb. From non stationarity to stationarityNow that we now our series has a trend we need to remove it in order to proceed with the models. We could have noticed that by only using our naked eye but we always need to double check. com ayuraj experiment tracking with weights and biases. This does not mean that the values for each data point have to be the same but the overall behavior of the data should remain constant. Testing StationarityOur time series data can have a trend or not. Tweet Count Evolution Note At the beginning of his tweeting journey he was barely using the platform a few times in a year. Goal This notebook has the purpose of analysing and predicting bitcoin prices using RAPIDS as well as identifying if there is any impact from Elon Musk s tweets on the fluctuation of the bitcoin prices. com rapidsai cuml tree branch 0. What tipe of ARIMA should I choose ARIMA AR Auto Regressive model I Integrated MA Moving AverageLet s take them step by step Auto Regressive Model An autoregressive AR model predicts future behavior based on past behavior. Predict Future Bitcoin Price using RAPIDS We ll use the RAPIDS distribution for this experiment as our data is extremely large more than 3 million observations. My Reference Bitcoin Price Prediction https towardsdatascience. Closer LookLet s use a magnifying glass and look closer to our points in time. The less information lost the better the model. Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average Explains a given time series based on its own past values that is its own lags and the lagged forecast errors so that equation can be used to forecast future values. ai andrada bitcoin musk workspace user andrada 2. It s also the year when Elon became. Predicting Bitcoin PriceNow let s predict Bitcoin Prices by using an ARIMA 1 1 2 model. This will help us understand a bit of his behavior as well as address and analyse the tweets that mention Bitcoin. To be observed that the wording sounds super positive yes yeah good thank people sure. Dogecoin I wanted to throw Dogecoin in there for fun. Hence we ll try to tweak these parameters and get ourselves the best model. Libraries Functions You can learn more about W B in this great kernel right here https www. You can observe some sudden peaks within a few days 1 do 4 days of the making of the tweet. You can find out more about RAPIDS and cuml here https github. Popularity Note It seems that his popularity grew with the number of tweets. The W B Dashboard https wandb. if you want you can find a correlation anywhere you look. If the data is non stationary meaning it has a trend we need to remove it in order to proceed with the analysis. Bitcoin Dogecoin Prices Elon Musk and RAPIDS IntroductionWhat does a virtual coin that people like or hate an excentric person that wants to get old on Mars and the suite of software libraries on GPUs all have in common Well you know what they say. It is of the utmost importance to determine how the series is behaving before applying any model to it. Most Frequent Words Note alot of talk about Tesla rocket Mars starship launch. We can do that by applying a natural log to our series. 2015 was his breaking point when he started tweeting more and more every year. apply lambda x clean_emoji x Strip of whitespaces Remove punctuation Make lowercase Tweets Create new features Clean Tweets Bitcoin Dogecoin Prints There are many missing values in Bitcoin data Hence we ll drop them Save Tweets data to W B Artifacts Yearly evolution Plot Picture Save Graph in W B Dashboard as well Get Popularity Information Plot ax. Moving Average Model The moving average model specifies that the output variable depends linearly on the current and various past values of a stochastic imperfectly predictable term. Analyse Bitcoin Evolution The W B Dashboard https wandb. Let s talk about Bitcoin and. Overall View It doesn t really look like there is any strong correlation or that the tweets drive peaks. I like that a lot he s always super positive and enthusiastin in his messages. It s used for forecasting when there is some correlation between values in a time series and the values that precede and succeed them. Criterias Log Likelihood Akaike and Bayesian Information Criterion are indicators that tell us how well our model is performing meaning how much information it s lost.

The steps will be Selecting only a small portion of data test we don t have to train on all 3 mil rows of data. Null Hypothesis H0 Null hypothesis of the test is that the time series can be represented by a unit root that is not stationary. Is there correlation between Dogecoin and Elon Musk s Tweets Is there Closer Look TODO Import W B overlapped graphs Work in Progress Specs on how I trained using RAPIDS on my local machine Z8 G4 Workstation 2 CPUs 96GB Memory NVIDIA Quadro RTX 8000 RAPIDS version 0. He increased gradually in likes with the peak in 2020 and I bet he ll continue in 2021 as well but the replies reached a peak as well he s communicating more with a broader audience who s speaking back. Alternative Hypothesis H1 Alternative Hypothesis of the test is that the time series is stationary. ai andrada bitcoin musk workspace user andrada 3. twitter and http https links Remove mentions and hashtags Extract Emojis and Remove from Tweet df tweet_emojis df tweet_emojis. Augmented Dicky Fuller test it determines how strongly a time series is defined by a trend. if you re really deeply paying attention. Let s see how that s done IV. Is there correlation between Bitcoin and Elon Musk s Tweets Let s find out In order to do this I ve decided to look at the points in time when Elon tweeted about Bitcoin.
