Based on my expereince the firat one is likely severe. Let s look at the examples again and consider odds. pdfBenchmark s Severe OR 8. The problem is in the scientific papers this ratio is not always laid out in the text and often the raw data to calculate the OR is contained in one of many tables in a paper so we have to teach agents to analyze the table data and choose the correct table then extract the proper data understanding if it is severity or fatality related or both and then extract or calculate the appropriate OR or ratio. 60 for this example OR Severe upper ratio is 4. pdfBenchmark s severe OR 1. com mlconsult simple odds ratio extractor so you can see them in live papers. com antgoldbloom aipowered literature review csvs tasks and the Kaggle CORD 19 Tasks project https www. To have a winning solution for round 2 our AI agents will have to be able to fill these types of tables as completely as possible the problem becomes all the needed data is not in the text of the document as discussed below. com antgoldbloom aipowered literature review csvs Cancer. com ajrwhite covid 19 risk factors smoking Here is pretty good example of the incubation period table filler https www. Table 4 is kind of in its own league but it provides numbers that might be used to calculate OR for severity. 85 To read more about calculating and understanding the OR see this page https journalfeed. com journals jamainternalmedicine fullarticle 2763184 So for that paper you want the frequencies in Table 3 table 3 is below here.

How to build a winning AI solution for Round 2Although the Kaggle team has not released the tasks for Round 2 the Kaggle Team has hinted that round 2 will be a combination of of the AI powered literature review https www. 88 p Table 7 example2020 03 26 Metabolic disturbances and inflammatory dysfunction predict severity of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID 19 a retrospective study medRxiv pdf https www. csv Here is an example of key scientific question table filling by davidmezetti https www. 01 Are any patterns emerging from the tables that can be exploited to help us Yes there are some patterns emerging in the 7 example tables above. Here is a link to an odds ratio extractor that shows how to get the OR and other ratios from the text of the papers. Tables 1 2 3 6 and 7 all list a number of cases that have hypertension with a number followed by a in Table 3 lists actual odds ratios as well but not clear from the table what the ratio relates to. 05 indicates there is not a statistically significant difference between groups severe statistically significant if the range contains 1 the differences in the severe group and not is not statistically significant if 1 is not in the range then it is statistically significant. I think round 2 will not have much question answering and will be based on table filling discussed below the only thing I think that will carry over from round 1 is the task topic questions. Secret to winning solution for round 2 is Table FillingTo have a winning submission for round 2 your agent is going to have to fill review tables. org the DOI column from the metadata.

Sorry this is not statistically significant. com allen institute for ai CORD 19 research challenge discussion 148807 so you can see the approaches the results and how they were implemented. severe adjusted was it adjusted for age of the patients severe calculated or extracted was the OR extracted from the paper or calculated Then you will see that the exact same columns are repeated for fatalities so you use the same analysis above just fatal or not fatal instead of severe case or not sever case. If the OR is 1 means the odds are increased for a given outcome. All of the articles below are on the contibutions page https www. com allen institute for ai CORD 19 research challenge discussion 139355 Sample this is simply how many patients or cases were included in the study davidmezetti has done very good work on this.

The good news is many people have been successful getting answers to question from the text of the documents and some folks have had success getting data to fill the review tables.

This notebook will discuss and give you an overview of some of the solutions to table filling that I have built and seen and then will demonstrate some techniques for how to make calculations that will be needed to win round 2 I hope this helps. Instead of infected vs. Currenlty there are two types of tables that we have been attempting to fill in data Risk Factors and Key Scientific questions. However it is unclear how the table data will be presented in the dataset and regardless we will still have to be able to extract that data. com antgoldbloom aipowered literature review csvs Air 20Temperature 20and 20COVID 20. So if the 95 confidence interval for an OR includes 1 it means the results are not statistically significant. Table 5 lists a clear ratio but it can not be determined what ratio from the table we have reutrned. not fatal alive for people with the underlying risk factor. 26 Now let s extract a few more tables from other articles to help understand formatsTo get to a point where we understand how the table data is formatted we need to examine a few more tables to see differences and similarities.

Note on Statistical SignificanceIf an odds ratio OR is 1 it means there is no association between the exposure and outcome. Simply put the OR is a way to present the strength of association between risk factors exposures and outcomes. 16 of 117 patients without ARDS had hypertension whereas 23 of 84 patients with ARDS had hypertension so in the medcalc odds ratio calculator a 23 b 84 23 61 c 16 d 117 16 101. com mlconsult incubation period ai lit review w table that I built. com davidmezzetti he has done amazing work on and is the best at sample size and study type as well as the amazing excerpts his solution have returned.
