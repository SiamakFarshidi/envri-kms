Count plot for categorical features Conclusion Restecg Thall Caa Slp are likely to impact few models sensitive to data distribution because value counts for some values is extremely low. Fbs is not related at all Sex Restecg have very weak correlation Sp Thall seem to have a moderately strong correlation Exng Caa Slp have decent correlation Plots for continous variables w. Relation to target variable All categorical variables except Fbs are related to output albeit to varying degrees. t output Conclusion Trtbps and Chol are not likely to have correlation Age and Thalachh might have weak correlation Oldpeak is likely to be correlated.

Heart Attack EDA and PredictionThis notebook aims at exploring the dataset and making predictions on whether a person will have heart attack or not. Especially Restecg and sex have very weak relation. If you liked the notebook please consider upvoting. com namanmanchanda for his tips on visualizations. Restecg Thall Caa Slp are likely to impact few models sensitive to data distribution because value counts for some values is extremely low. All continous variables are related to output Multi collinearity Variables do not have strong correlation and are weakly correlated Model Development Loading Libraries Feature Engineering We would get out X as the values we determined to have an impact Standardize them and get One hot encoding for categorical variables. oldpeak and chol moderately are not uniformly distributed. t to output Conclusion Fbs doesn t seem to be related at all to output Sex Restecg seem to be somewhat correlated to output Others have a fair correlation w. t to output Corrected Cramer s V for categorical variables ConclusionThe stats seem to agree with the conclusions we drew previously from graph along with a measure of the correlation. This could affect models or analysis with uniform distribution as requirement. Also thanks to my bro Naman Manchanda https www. Bivariate Analysis Seperation of categorical variables w. Check for Multi Collinearity Correlation of variables among themselves ConclusionVariables do not have strong correlation and are weakly correlated Pair plot One plot to rule them all Conclusion Here s the conclusion from the entire EDA Feature Insights chol trtbps and oldpeak have decent amount of outliers. Training Models and Getting Results Stacking Plot of Scores Conclusion We started with tabular data and performed EDA and got crucial information We did some feature engineering by performing Standardization and One Hot Encoding We created several models and got their results. Kruskal Wallis H test Since the distribution for some variables is non Gaussian we would be using non parametric test specifically Kruskal Wallis H Test ConclusionSuprisingly all variables have correlation. t output Kruskal Wallis H test Check for Multi Collinearity Correlation of variables among themselves Pair plot One plot to rule them all Conclusion Model Development Loading Libraries Feature Engineering Training Models and Getting Results Stacking Plot of Scores Conclusion Thank you Dataset Info age Age of the patient sex Sex of the patient cp Chest pain type 0 Typical Angina 1 Atypical Angina 2 Non anginal Pain 3 Asymptomatic trtbps Resting blood pressure in mm Hg chol Cholestoral in mg dl fetched via BMI sensor fbs fasting blood sugar 120 mg dl 1 True 0 False restecg Resting electrocardiographic results 0 Normal 1 ST T wave normality 2 Left ventricular hypertrophy thalachh Maximum heart rate achieved oldpeak Previous peak slp Slope caa Number of major vessels thall Thalium Stress Test result 0 3 exng Exercise induced angina 1 Yes 0 No output Target variable Preparing Workspace Importing Libraries Setting Params Loading Data Preliminary Analysis Shape of the dataset Preview of the dataset Missing Values Categorical and Continous General Stats Exploratory Data Analysis Univariate Analysis Voilin plot for continous variables Conclusion chol trtbps and oldpeak have decent amount of outliers that could affect certain models sensitive to them. Fbs and Cp could possibly affect models sensitive to data distribution because their value counts is also not ideal. This could affect certain models sensitive to them.
