In this tutorial I will show how to code a license plate recognizer for Indian license plates using deep learning and some image processing. Testing the above function \u56fe\u7247 Getting plate prom the processed image Match contours to license plate or character template Find all contours in the image Retrieve potential dimensions Check largest 5 or 15 contours for license plate or character respectively detects contour in binary image and returns the coordinates of rectangle enclosing it checking the dimensions of the contour to filter out the characters by contour s size stores the x coordinate of the character s contour to used later for indexing the contours extracting each character using the enclosing rectangle s coordinates. Make result formatted for classification invert colors Resize the image to 24x44 with black border List that stores the character s binary image unsorted Return characters on ascending order with respect to the x coordinate most left character first arbitrary function that stores sorted list of character indeces stores character images according to their index Find characters in the resulting images Preprocess cropped license plate image Make borders white Estimations of character contours sizes of cropped license plates Get contours within cropped license plate Let s see the segmented characters this is the target directory all images will be resized to 28x28 this is the target directory all images will be resized to 28x28 batch_size 1 Metrics for checking the model performance while training Predicting the output iterating over the characters preparing image for the model predicting the class storing the result in a list Segmented characters and their predicted value. returning the processed image. add the path to india_license_plate. extracting the Region of Interest of license plate for blurring. Find the detailed explanation of the project in this blog https towardsdatascience. finally representing the detected contours by drawing rectangles around the edges. the function detects and perfors blurring on the number plate. com ai based indian license plate detector de9d48ca8951 source friends_link sk a2cbd70e630f6dc3d030e3bae34d98ef Model for characters Loads the data required for detecting the license plates from cascade classifier.
