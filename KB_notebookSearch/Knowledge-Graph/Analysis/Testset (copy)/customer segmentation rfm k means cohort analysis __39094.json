Create Cohort and Conduct Cohort Analysis Cohort Analysis https medium. 5 K Means Implementation For k means you have to set k to the number of clusters you want but figuring out how many clusters is not obvious from the beginning. 1 What is RFM Analysis and Overview 5. 4 Calculate Frequency 5. 5 Calculate Monetary Values Monetary Total amount of money spentThe monetary value is calculated by adding together the cost of the customers purchases. 5 Clean the Data from the Noise and Missing Values 1. com profile ckwspn94d145393876obwft79zug 2. Without using transform we can t get output s length same like dataframe4. What Are We Gonna Do First of all to observe the structure of the data and missing values you can use exploratory data analysis and data visualization techniques. After the above operations you will have made cluster estimation with K Means. com blog rfm analysis. 7 Visualize the Clusters 7. Cluster 1 The first cluster belongs to the Best Customers segment which we saw earlier as they purchase recently R 4 frequent buyers F 4 and spent the most M 4 Cluster 2 Second cluster can be interpreted as passer customers as their last purchase is long ago R 2 F 4 M 4. In this section you will create an RFM Segmentation Table where you segment your customers by using the RFM table. It excludes NaN values by default. 2 Creating the RFM Segmentation Table 1. Find the unique number of InvoiceNo per customer2. Because I have unique customer ids here and I used transform let s add this into dataset Let s drop anyway Exact length is gotten only by using transform Let s see how many of which rfm_score here are.

So we don t want to assign these orders to those customers because this would alter the insights we draw from the data. 3 Visualize Feature Distributions To get a better understanding of the dataset you can costruct a scatter matrix of each of the three features in the RFM data. 4 Handling Missing Values 4. It acts as a statistical hypothesis test where the null hypothesis is that the data is generated by a Poisson point process and are thus uniformly randomly distributed. InvoiceDate Invoice Date and time. Now let s find out what a negative UnitPrice means. In general we can say the following at first sight According to the dataset we have United Kingdom has an overwhelming advantage compared to other countries in terms of total number of unique customers. 2 Define and Plot Feature Correlations Create Heatmap and evaluate the results 4. You must do descriptive analysis. Well as the name suggests Customer Segmentation could segment customers according to their precise needs. 2 Visualize analysis of cohort 1 using seaborn and matplotlib modules 5. Nominal a 5 digit integral number uniquely assigned to each customer. References LinkedIn https www. 3 Calculate Recency Recency Days since last purchaseTo calculate the recency values follow these steps in order 1. Result The UK is not only the country with the most sales revenue but also the country with the most customers. Let s do it both for UK and for the whole dataset. In this context it will be useful to examine feature correlations and distributions. 6 Explore the Orders 1. Don t include NaN in the count. An important marketing strategy e commerce businesses use for analyzing and predicting customer value is customer segmentation. We will assign a score from 1 to 4 to each category Recency Frequency and Monetary with 4 being the highest best value. Some of the common ways of segmenting customers are based on their Recency Frequency Monatory values their demographics like gender region country etc and some of their business crafted scores. by performing Cohort analysis you can get the following answers to the following questions How much effective was a marketing campaign held in a particular time period Did the strategy employ to improve the conversion rates of Customers worked Should I focus more on retention rather than acquiring new customers Are my customer nurturing strategies effective Which marketing channels bring me the best results Is there a seasonality pattern in Customer behavior Along with various performance measures metrics for your organization. 7 Original dataset 8872 or 2 Tortured dataset orders were cancelled. 4 Calculate Frequency Frequency Number of purchasesTo calculate how many times a customer purchased something we need to count how many invoices each customer has. Since we will be performing Cohort Analysis based on transaction records of customers the columns we will be dealing with mainly Invoice Data CustomerID Price QuantityThe following steps will performed to generate the Cohort Chart of Retention Rate Month Extraction from InvioceDate column Assigning Cohort to Each Transaction Assigning Cohort Index to each transaction Calculating number of unique customers in each Group of ChortDate Index Creating Cohort Table for Retention Rate Creating the Cohort Chart using the Cohort TableThe Detailed information about each step is given below 5. Create df_uk DataFrame2. For Customer Segmentation you will use the df_rfm data set resulting from the RFM analysis. org wiki Elbow_method_ clustering Silhouette Coefficient http scikit learn. Make a copy of df_uk and drop duplicates2. Our goal in this Notebook is to cluster the customers in our data set to Recognize who are our most valuable customers Increase revenue Increase customer retention Learn more about the trends and behaviors of our customers Define customers that are at riskWe will start with RFM Analysis and then compliment our findings with predictive analysis using K Means Clustering Algorithms. 0 Let s see what our total unique number of customers graph would look like if we didn t include United Kingdom. Create Cohort and Conduct Cohort Analysis 8 5. 1 Calculate RFM Scoring The simplest way to create customer segments from an RFM model is by using Quartiles. Calculate sum total cost by customers and named Monetary 2. Let s do some analysis between cancelled non cancelled orders and quantity. First let s check how many unique customerid I have Hmm But when I check again while grouping by countries a different result comes out. 2 Define and Plot Feature Correlations 7. com capillary data science rfm analysis an effective customer segmentation technique using python 58804480d232 About Data Using the Online Retail dataset https archive. You can observe the properties of the resulting clusters with the help of the boxplot. 7 Visualize the Clusters 1. It means some customerid totally 8 are included in multiple country names. Let s sort it out and get a nicer insight in the next line. Before starting the RFM Analysis you will be asked to do some analysis regarding the distribution of Orders Customers and Countries. First you will create 4 variables that capture the integer value of years months for Invoice and Cohort Date using the get_date_int function which you ll create it below.

Cohort analysis is an analytics method by which these groups can be tracked over time for finding key insights. 1 Future Engineering 5. 7 Explore Customers by Country 4. Then you will compare the classification made by the algorithm with the classification you have made yourself. From this the following conclusions can be drawn Our first finding regarding the clustering tendency is supported by the score that we obtained with the Hopkins method which we found to be very close to zero. Create your plot and resize it. Group by CustomerID and check the last date of purchase4. Customer data is used to sort customers into group based on their behaviors and preferences. In addition the data you apply for K Means should be normalized. Create a new column called Date which contains the invoice date without the timestamp Let s create a date column with only dates need to extract time part hour min sec etc. You will use this function to extract the integer values for Invoice as well as Cohort Date in 3 seperate series for each of the two columnsUse the variables created above to calcualte the difference in days and store them in cohort Index column. Now we will drop NanN values of only customerid column. groupby cohortmonth cohortindex CustomerID. CustomerID Customer number. Calculate the days since last purchase That s the recency Days since last purchase5. The log function computes the value of the natural logarithm of argument x.

We did not see any negative value in unitprice but we have zero values. Visualize Cluster Id vs Recency Cluster Id vs Frequency and Cluster Id vs Monetary using Box plot. Define rfm_level function that tags customers by using RFM_Scrores and Create a new variable RFM_Level5. In the next lines we get a more general and understandable output. Total Price Quantity X Unit Price 2. 5 K Means Implementation 7. If you specified kde True on the hist plot it returns the kde curve and returns the count value on the vertical axis. com understanding k means clustering in machine learning 6a6e67336aa1 since we already have our distinct groups determined. So lets find out how many orders were cancelled 9288 or 1. But when we are grouping them using with contry column Our unique number of customers is increasing. After that the data set will be ready for RFM analysis. Cohort analysis is a subset of behavioral analytics that takes the user data and breaks them into related groups for analysis. These RFM metrics are important indicators of a customer s behavior because frequency and monetary value affects a customer s lifetime value and recency affects retention a measure of engagement. Before applying K Means Clustering you should do data pre processing.

Many customers of the company are wholesalers. Note K means is sensitive to initializations because they are critical to qualifty of optima found. How many customers do we have in each segment 4. describe include object. 5 and uniformly distributed data will tend to result in values close to 0. 2 Visualize analysis of cohort 1 using seaborn and matplotlib 8. This code gives us very good insight but very detailed information. RFM analysis was first used by the direct mail industry more than four decades ago yet it is still an effective way to optimize your marketing. Way More General 1. Numeric Product price per unit in sterling. We can roughly classify these numbers. 4 Handling Missing Values Let s assume that the orders which do NOT have customer ID s were not made by the customers already in the dataset because the customers who in fact made some purchases already have ID s. 5 Calculate Monetary Values 5. To calculate recency we need to choose a date as a point of reference to evaluate how many days ago was the customer s last purchase. Segments1 Segments2 Using customer segmentation categories found here http www. 2 Visualize analysis of cohort 3 using seaborn and matplotlib modules 6. Because you must understand the relationship of the features to each other and clear the noise and missing values in the data. org stable auto_examples cluster plot_kmeans_silhouette_analysis. We need to change it s dtype as datetime We can do the same for the whole dataset but it is not necessary. Nominal the name of the country where each customer resides. 3 What does the letter C in the InvoiceNo column mean If the invoice number starts with the letter C it means the order was cancelled. T df_model will be created for further analysis in case of not loosing some information about customer. And as the name of the project suggests I will show and create RFM Cohort and Conduct Cohort Analysis. Also create separate score column for each value. Dist plot adds the kde curve by default and brings the density on the vertical axis. The second way to create a segments column. transform min Count monthly active customers from each cohort Return number of unique elements in the object. nunique ratio Looking deeper into why these orders were cancelled may prevent future cancellations. 3 Calculate Recency 5. Calculate the days since last purchase5. Group by CustomerID and check the last date of purchase Now we will group dates by customers. 5 Create the 2nd Cohort Average Quantity Sold 5. Quantity The quantities of each product item per transaction. Low value customers Cluster 0 The third cluster is more related to the Almost Lost segment as they Haven t purchased for some time R 1 but used to purchase frequently and spent a lot. If this code starts with letter c it indicates a cancellation. These confirm that negative values indicate the order has been cancelled. So you will continue to analyze only UK transactions in the next RFM Analysis Customer Segmentation and K Means Clustering topics. A value close to 1 tends to indicate the data is highly clustered random data will tend to result in values around 0. 6 Explore the Orders 4. 2 Extract the Month of the Purchase 8. 1 Calculate RFM Scoring 6. The company mainly sells unique all occasion gifts. Customer Segmentation with RFM Scores 6 3. com in emirhan bozdogan Kaggle https www. But we can not use sum unique nunique etc directly. For Recency customers in the first quarter should be scored as 4 this represents the highest Recency value. 644 To see and understand the_total price s range. Description Product item name. You will calculate the Recency Frequency and Monetary values of the customers in the RFM Analysis you will make using the data consisting of UK transactions. Plot RFM distributions 2 differences between hist plot and distplot 1. Let s see how much of each product UK has. Feature Information InvoiceNo Invoice number. 2 Creating the RFM Segmentation Table. 1 Import Modules Load Data Data Review 4. But can an unsupervised learning model do this better for us You will use the K Means algorithm to find the answer to this question. For e commerce organizations cohort analysis is a unique opportunity to find out which clients are the most valuable to their business. In terms of a product a cohort can be a group of people with the same sign up date the same usage starts month date or the same traffic source. Let s see how this compares to the number of unique products per customer. From those answers various methods of clustering can be used and applied on RFM variable or directly on the transaction data set. Create a new column called Date which contains the invoice date without the timestamp3. We see that there are negative values in the Quantity and UnitPrice columns. By using RFM Analysis you can enable companies to develop different approaches to different customer segments so that they can get to know their customers better observe trends better and increase customer retention and sales revenues. Now find the last and first selling date of my whole dataset. 3 Calculating time offset in Months i. Data Cleaning Exploratory Data Analysis 4 1. You should visualize the cluster distribution by using a scatter plot. Conversely for Frequency and Monetary customers in the last quarter should be scored as 4 representing the highest Frequency and Monetary values. 6 Create the 3rd Cohort Average Sales 5. 36 cancelled and at the same time customerid. The majority of this dataset includes orders from the UK. You will use Recency Frequency Monatory values for this case. COMPARISON OF LOG AND LOG1P For real valued input log1p is accurate also for x so small that 1 x 1 in floating point accuracy.
