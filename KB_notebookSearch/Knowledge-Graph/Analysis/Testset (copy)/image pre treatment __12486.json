Both OpenCV Scikit Image and Matplotlib imports images as Numpy array of the form Height Width Number of colors i. rotate moduleTo flip the image we can use directly the fact that an image is a np. org Scikit Image https scikit image. com prasunroy natural images Importing ImagesIn addition to the Matplotlib library there are other common libraries for working with images PIL https pillow. Therefore Scikit image includes a function to evaluate thresholding algorithms provided by the library. The erosion of A by B is also given by A ominus B bigcap_ b in B A_ b. org wiki Watershed_ image_processing 2 https scikit image. This can often be used to remove noise from an image such as is common in photgraphs taken in low light conditions. Erosion Erosion has the effect of removing pixels at the edges of shapes in the image. COLOR_BGR2RGB We may convert a RGB image H W 3 into a grey scale H W image via the sk. array so we may easily use the np. Invert the image back so the background is white. For example running this by clicking run or pressing Shift Enter will list all files under the input directory for dirname _ filenames in os.

Implementing the code in PythonTo implement the code in Python we will use the module skimage. Image Normalization Contrast stretching Histogram Equalization3. pyplot library has an imsave method Normalization and Filters NormalizationFrom wikipedia 1 In image processing normalization is a process that changes the range of pixel intensity values. sobel method to apply the Sobel algorithm to images ThresholdingThe simplest thresholding methods replace each pixel in an image with a black pixel if the image intensity I_ i j is less than some fixed constant T that is I_ i j T or a white pixel if the image intensity is greater than that constant 1. sobel method ndimage. The watershed transformation treats the image it operates upon like a topographic map with the brightness of each point representing its height and finds the lines that run along the tops of ridges 1. equalize_hist Return image after histogram equalization. org wiki Normalization_ image_processing 2 https en. com prasunroy available on kaggle at https www. Apply watershed Find watershed basins in image flooded from given markers. The PIL package has is own type PIL. dilation image selem None out None shift_x False shift_y False Return greyscale morphological dilation of an image. Manipulating Images basicsWe now see how to easily flip rotate resize images. org docs dev api skimage. This is accomplished by doing a convolution between a kernel and an image. org wiki Histogram_equalization FiltersFilters are implemented by defining numeric grids called kernels 1 that are convolved across an image to change the value of the pixel in the middle of the grid by calculating a weighted sum of the surrounding pixels using the values in the kernel as weights. org We now import the three modules and open an image with each of the three in order to see the differences. thumbnail method is INPLACE TRUE ALWAYS we call the thumbnail method with the resample Image. org wiki Cumulative_distribution_function cdf the Histrogram normalization makes it almost an exact line since the goal of Histogram normalization is to make the histogram of the distribution of pixel values flat. walk kaggle input for filename in filenames Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output. Applications include photographs with poor contrast due to glare for example. The main difference are 1. Kernel ImageFilter. B is a disk or a square and this center is located on the origin of E then the erosion of A by B can be understood as the locus of points reached by the center of B when B moves inside A. rescale_intensity and. a subset of the space or grid. For example a newspaper will strive to make all of the images in an issue share a similar range of grayscale. So the best option is to combine the two operations using the thumbnail method to rescale the image so that it s longest dimension fits the desired size and then create a new background image of the right dimensions and then paste the rescaled thumbnail into the middle of the background. Often the motivation is to achieve consistency in dynamic range for a set of data signals or images to avoid mental distraction or fatigue. Opening The opening of A by B is obtained by the Erosion of A by B followed by a Dilation of the resulting image again by B A circ B A ominus B oplus B. open We opend the second image using skimage module skimage_io called as sk_io We open the third image using OpenCV module cv2. resize the image so the longest dimension matches our target size Create a new square background image Paste the resized image into the center of the square background return the resized image Get the image size We ll resize this so it s 150 x 150 with black padding Show the original and resized images Create a figure Subplot for original image Subplot for resized image Delete the folder if it already exists Create the folder Save the image PIL has the. Return threshold value based on Otsu s method. html highlight watershed This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed It is defined by the kaggle python docker image https github. Since there are a few steps to this we ll encapsulate all of them in a function resize_image. The purpose of dynamic range expansion in the various applications is usually to bring the image or other type of signal into a range that is more familiar or normal to the senses hence the term normalization. In practice they are used to apply visual enhancement effects to the image such as sharpening blurring and so on. resize module that really resize the image but do not scale image. Display it Apply erosion sk_mm. Image let you custom your kernel let us see an example below Edge Detection and Sobel Filter Edge Detection Sobel FilterIf the built in FIND EDGES filter doesn t provide what you need you could use a Sobel edge detection algorithm which involves convolving two filters across an image to find the horizontal and vertical vector gradients for each pixel and then calculating the magnitude length of each vector gradient. array to the PIL image the viceversa may be extremy useful and it is done via the Image. cvtColor cv_image cv2. The Sobel filter apply two filers G_x and G_y to the images those are G_x left begin matrix 1 2 1 0 0 0 1 2 1 end matrix right G_y left begin matrix 1 0 1 2 0 2 1 0 1 end matrix right And then the filtered images has gradient magnitude G sqrt G_x 2 G_y 2 the gradient direction is Theta arctan frac G_y G_x The pseudocode implementation is 1 function sobel A as two dimensional image array Gx 1 0 1 2 0 2 1 0 1 Gy 1 2 1 0 0 0 1 2 1 rows size A 1 columns size A 2 mag zeros A for i 1 rows 2 for j 1 columns 2 S1 sum sum Gx.
