CONTINUOUS FEATURES AGE As we can see from people above the age of 40 are more likely to get strokes Log distribution of age BMI Bmi has lots of outliers DISTRIBUTION OF BMI WITHOUT OUTLIERS Distribution of bmi become more normally distributed after removing outliers so we will now consider this data for further modelling and prediction AVERAGE GLUCOSE LEVEL Glucose level less than 150 and greater than 150 leading to strokes DISTRIBUTION OF GLUCOSE_LEVEL WITHOUT OUTLIERS Distribution of avg_glucose_level also got the same results like bmi but removing 12.
