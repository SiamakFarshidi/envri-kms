Combined the two methods allows for some diversity in the loss while benefitting from the stability of BCE. Also implementation of same using keras is described in my blog http https medium. com arunm8489 an overview on u net architecture d6caabf7caa4 post. com how to save and load a model in pytorch with a complete example c2920e617dee save checkpoint data to the path given checkpoint_path if it is a best model min validation loss copy that checkpoint file to best path given best_model_path load check point initialize state_dict from checkpoint to model initialize optimizer from checkpoint to optimizer initialize valid_loss_min from checkpoint to valid_loss_min return model optimizer epoch value min validation loss forward propogation setting gradient to zero create checkpoint variable and add important data save checkpoint save checkpoint as best model loading the saved model. sigmoid x comment out if your model contains a sigmoid or equivalent activation layer flatten label and prediction tensors ref https towardsdatascience. This will be a quick and dirty kernel showing how to get started on segmenting nuclei using a neural network in Pytorch. The architecture used is the so called U Net which is very common for image segmentation problems such as this. Now we will just check the shape of images and masks loadedWe will use 580 images for train and 90 images for validation Loss function and IOU metricThis loss combines Dice loss with the standard binary cross entropy BCE loss that is generally the default for segmentation models. You can understand more about unet from https arxiv. Similarly we use intersection over union as a metricNow we will write some utility functions to save and load best model on training Model training Plotting Loss and IOU Scores Visualisation of actual and predicted mask mkdir kaggle working data unzip kaggle input data science bowl 2018 stage1_train.
