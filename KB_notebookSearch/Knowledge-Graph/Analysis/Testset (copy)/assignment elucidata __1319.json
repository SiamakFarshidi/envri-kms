Are the neuroendocrine tumors clearly separable from the adenocarcinoma tumors Ans some neuroendocrine tumors are clrearly separable from adenocarcinoma tumors but very few are overlapped with adenocarcinoma tumors. Based on this distribution can we identify the presence of high and low IFN subtypes in PAAD Yes we can identify the presence of IFN in PAAD subtypes. Question 2 Can you characterize the presence of IFN signature in pancreatic adenocarcinoma tumors by assigning a score to each sample which denotes the positive or negative presence of IFN genes in the sample Ans Yes I can characterize the presence of IFN signature in pancreatic adenocarcinoma tumors and also assigned score to each gene per histological type by taking sum of each the sample gene divide by count of each sample. How is the distribution of this score among the different samples Ans Distribution of each gene score to each sample type is not varied too much. What can be said about the variance of the PCA Ans 96 variance is captured on eigen vector value 125.
