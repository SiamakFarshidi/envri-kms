See the Interactive 3D Scatterplot section. remove cards that are banned in any game type remove tokens without types Power and toughness that depends on board state or mana cannot be resolved Combine colorIdentity and colors Include colorless and multi color. I think this is dirty data. Co occurrences Correlation Heatmap Creatures Interactive 3D ScatterplotInteractive 3D scatter of power versus toughness by Color gives a good overview of the creatures available. the axes frame to draw correctly for a polygon frame. For example Counterspell seems to me like the typical blue spell. Each radar shows the distribution of cards into 5 types with every circle denoting 10. Exhibit C the edge case when both colors and colorIdentity are missing 1. Recommened views zoom in and assume an isometric view 2D view of power 2D view of toughness Mana distribution Power distribution Toughness distribution Radar chart factoryCode from http matplotlib.

Capture release filter Some data fu to get all cards into a single table along with a couple of release columns. Exhibit A the edge case when colors is missing but colorIdentity is not 1. Truly colorless artifacts like Leonin Scimitar. For this notebook we limit the number of releases so that we can include a low level visualization of power vs toughness. Truly colorless artifact creatures like Juggernaut. Exhibit B the edge case when colorIdentity is missing but colors is not 1. Is there a better way of grouping Values are percentages so 100 artifacts does not mean there are lots of artifacts of that color. For simple visualizations we have to make some simplifications. html Radar ChartWe will look at how the distribution of card types varies by mana color. I m not a MTG expert so maybe there is some rule I m not aware of. We ll assign colors to exhibits A and B below but not to C. Ordered by release date. Eldrazi creatures that need a specific color mana to cast but is Deviod of a color type. And it s interesting that the mult color creatures have a negative relationship between power and toughness. org examples api radar_chart. For example Serra Angel needs white mana to cast and should count as white for Protection From White. 5 use 1 line segment to connect specified points define draw_frame method FIXME markers at x 0 y 0 get doubled up The following is a hack to get the spines i. But all possible releases in the data are listed in the appendix appendix below. Feel free to fork this and edit the release_filter variable below for any release that you may be interested in. Artifacts that do not need colored mana to cast but activations associated with colored mana. spine_type must be left right top bottom or circle. Read Data Remove Outliers Preprocess ColorA core part of Magic The Gathering MTG is how different rules interact with each other. remove promo cards that aren t used in normal play Edit 2016 09 30 Could be null because it s too new to have a ruling on it. close off polygon by repeating first vertex Do not double count creatures Some double counting of artifacts and enchantments exist but it s rare. IntroductionThis notebook is a fork of the one that gave a high level look into the 5 core mana colors for all releases together. Refer to it to define your own release_filter. Notice how much of an outlier the colorless Metalwork Colossus is.
