The main intervention strategies for these diseases encompass preventive chemotherapy through targeted or mass drug administration, or innovative and intensified diseases management. However, it is anticipated that with current drugs and strategies, control or elimination may not be achieved everywhere for all NTD's. For on-going efforts to achieve these goals, there is an urgent need to understand where endemic countries stand now in terms of progress towards control and elimination, and what they can expect to achieve in the coming decade with current or alternative intervention strategies.<br><br>The postdoctoral researcher will work on evaluating the current status of NTD control and predicting elimination prospects, as a member of the international NTD Modelling Consortium, and in an ongoing collaboration with endemic countries and stakeholders. The research will involve working with various established individual-based and deterministic models for transmission and control of NTDs, developed at the Department of Public Health. The researcher will quantify these models for relevant scenarios, based on geospatial epidemiological data and programmatic data on interventions, and will predict the impact of various intervention scenarios. The work may also involve further refining of the models, based on field data, literature and expert opinion available through our broad network in NTD research. The research will provide important information on where and for which NTDs additional efforts are necessary to achieve control or elimination, as well as an assessment of the extent to which new types of interventions could support these goals.", "requirements_description": "<div class=\"_Section_Section_26Kh4ZAK\">\n<h2 class=\"_Section_title_2lZ2dR7H\">\n<span>Requirements</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"_Section_body_1yeeKPXy\">\n    The position is offered to PhD graduates in Health Sciences, Public Health, Epidemiology, Medicine, Mathematics, Econometrics, Biostatistics, or a related field.
