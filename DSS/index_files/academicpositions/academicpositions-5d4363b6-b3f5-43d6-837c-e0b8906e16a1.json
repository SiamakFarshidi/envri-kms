After a cancer diagnosis, typically a range of therapies is started, including, for example, chemo- or radiation therapy, combined with therapy for positive lifestyle changes, such as more healthy eating or stopping with smoking. While the core medical treatments are typically strictly adhered to in the oncology domain, the lifestyle changes are generally harder to achieve, partly also because the medical treatment is often intense and puts a strong burden on the patient. In this project, we will systematically explore, based on both predictors from the scientific literature as well as from new data sets, which groups of people have an increased risk of not fully adhering to therapy. Special attention will be given to groups that are particularly at risk, such as those with a low SES or low health literacy. In this project, a range of approaches will be combined, including literature review, surveys, experiments, focus groups, and/or interviews.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>About the project</strong></p><p>BEAMER (short for &ldquo;BEhavioral and Adherence Model for improving quality, health outcomes and cost-Effectiveness of healthcaRe&rdquo;) is a five-year project, funded by IMI H2020, which brings together 28 European partners (from 13 countries), from academia, civil society and industry. The project tackles an important health challenge: patient non-adherence to prescribed treatment. It affects patient health outcomes significantly, contributing to 200,000 premature deaths in the EU annually, and places a heavy economic burden on the healthcare system, leading to an estimated 125B euros in avoidable hospitalizations, emergency care, and adult outpatient visits each year. Despite existing research on disease-specific medication adherence, there are few broad insights regarding how to improve adherence across healthcare. To address this, BEAMER aims to acquire a comprehensive understanding of the factors that influence patient adherence, irrespective of the therapeutic area, and enable stakeholders to design effective solutions that could promote broad and consistent impact within a real-world context.</p>", "requirements_description": "<div class=\"_Section_Section_26Kh4ZAK\">\n<h2 class=\"_Section_title_2lZ2dR7H\">\n<span>Requirements</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"_Section_body_1yeeKPXy\">\n<p>Candidates for this position should have a (research) master\u2019s degree in (health) communication, communication science, linguistics, cognitive science, behavioural science, or a related field.
