In the REF2014 exercise, 90% of the Engineering outputs were graded 3* or 4*, and Durham was ranked 4th in the UK for impact in the General Engineering unit of assessment. The Department is committed to an ethos of research-led teaching at all levels of our taught programmes. Durham University was ranked 4th in The Guardian University Guide 2021, 6th in The Times and Sunday Times Good University Guide 2021, and 4th in The Complete University Guide 2022 for General Engineering. We were ranked 2nd in Engineering behind only Cambridge, in a recent Institute for Fiscal Studies report on the difference in graduate earnings by UK university choice.
