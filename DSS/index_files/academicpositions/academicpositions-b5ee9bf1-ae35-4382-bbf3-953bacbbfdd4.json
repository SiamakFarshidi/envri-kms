The center is a top-level scientific institute with an extensive network of international collaborations in Europe and the rest of the world.ContextWe are looking for a post-doc or engineer for a short position of 6 months to work in the CPS4EU European project ending in june 2022, and contribute to ongoing work [1,2] on self-adaptive computing in Cyber Physical Systems, in cooperation with industrial partners of the project.ContextCyber Physical Systems (CPS) are systems that create a link between physical and digital worlds and enable cooperation among systems. Applications are in domains like automotive, energy and industry automation, involving technologies like sensors, AI, cybersecurity and computing. Middleware support for CPS is required for their design, providing for abstraction layers for the communication with sensors and actuators, as well as implementation and execution of control loops of the Physical Systems. In CPS collaborative systems, individual CPSs require coordination because of the growing number of nodes and level of autonomy of systems, for which a mastery of modes of local and decentralized cooperation will be needed to exploit the potential of the CPS.Autonomic, self-adaptive and reconfigurable computing systems are required in smart environments like CPS, because they have the ability to adapt to their environment in order to achieve a set of objectives (e.g., comfort, security and energy savings). This is done by changing their architecture configuration and behavior upon the occurrence of specific events. Building such systems requires to design and implement autonomic feedback loops that collect events and measurements, make decisions and execute the corresponding actions. The design and the implementation of such loops are made difficult by several factors: the complexity of systems with multiple objectives, the risk of conflicting decisions between multiple loops, the inconsistencies that can result from communication errors and hardware failures and the heterogeneity of the devices.The research takes place in the H2020 project CPS4EU, more particularly in Work Packages concerning CPS collaborative systems, and CPS for use cases. It will be done in cooperation with our industrial partners RTE and ACOEM, and with a former post-doc now at U. Odense, DK.AssignmentThe objective is to contribute to the software architectures supporting the cooperation and coordination of multiple management and control loops, some concerning the physical systems, others the management of the middleware and the loop processes themselves.The work will contribute to ongoing work, building upon previous results [1,2] in design frameworks for reliable and self-adaptive systems, where multiple autonomic loops can be composed into complex managers, with application to smart environments.[1] Mahyar T Moghaddam, Eric Rutten, Philippe Lalanda, Guillaume GiraudIAS: an IoT Architectural Self-adaptation FrameworkECSA 2020 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 14th European Conference on Software Architecture, Sep 2020, L\u00e2\u0080\u0099Aquila, Italy. pp.1-16https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02900674[2] Mahyar T.
