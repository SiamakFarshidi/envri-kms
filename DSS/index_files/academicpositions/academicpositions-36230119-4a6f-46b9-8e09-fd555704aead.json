The PhD student must be flexible and communicative and able to work in both biochemical and biophysical labs, learn advanced bioelectrochemical methods and use (semi)automated computational analysis of large datasets.</p>", "requirements_description": "<div class=\"_Section_Section_26Kh4ZAK\">\n<h2 class=\"_Section_title_2lZ2dR7H\">\n<span>Requirements</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"_Section_body_1yeeKPXy\">\n<p><strong>Selection Criteria</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Master degree in biochemistry, life-science technology or equivalent</li>\n<li>Proven interest in either membrane protein function, single-enzyme research or bioinorganic chemistry</li>\n<li>Proficient in English</li>\n<li>Excellent oral and written communication skills</li>\n<li>Capable of independent working as well as working in a (interdisciplinary) team</li>\n<li>Ambitious with good time-management skills to work effectively towards a long-term goal</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Start of the project will be between April and September 2022.</p>\n</div>\n</div>", "conditions_description": "<div class=\"_Section_Section_26Kh4ZAK\">\n<h2 class=\"_Section_title_2lZ2dR7H\">\n<span>Conditions of employment</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"_Section_body_1yeeKPXy\">\n<p><strong>Terms and conditions\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>We offer a full-time position for initially one year.

It is a faculty where personal and academic development are top priorities. Our people are committed to expand fundamental knowledge by curiosity and to look beyond the borders of their own discipline; their aim is to benefit science, and to make a contribution to addressing the major societal challenges of the future.</p>\n<p>The research carried out at the Faculty of Science is very diverse, ranging from mathematics, information science, astronomy, physics, chemistry and bio-pharmaceutical sciences to biology and environmental sciences. The research activities are organised in eight institutes. These institutes offer eight bachelor\u2019s and twelve master\u2019s programmes. The faculty has grown strongly in recent years and now has more than 2.300 staff and more than 5.000 students. We are located at the heart of Leiden\u2019s Bio Science Park, one of Europe\u2019s biggest science parks, where university and business life come together.</p>\n<p>The chemistry and life science research in the Leiden Institute of Chemistry (LIC) is organized around two major research areas: \u2018Chemical Biology\u2019 and \u2018Energy &amp; Sustainability\u2019. The institute\u2019s research themes illustrate the central position of chemistry between biology, medicine and physics. The various research topics carried out within these themes are ideal for executing interdisciplinary research.</p>\n<p>For more information, see\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/science\">www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/science</a>\u00a0 and\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://workingat.leiden.edu/\">https://workingat.leiden.edu/</a></p>\n</div>\n</div>", "department_description": "N/A", "additional_information": "<div class=\"_Section_Section_26Kh4ZAK\">\n<h2 class=\"_Section_title_2lZ2dR7H\">\n<span>Additional information</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"_Section_body_1yeeKPXy\">\n<p><strong>Diversity</strong></p>\n<p>Leiden\u00a0University\u00a0is strongly committed to diversity within its community and especially welcomes applications from members of underrepresented groups.</p>\n<p><strong>Information</strong></p>\n<p>Enquiries can be made to Prof.dr.
