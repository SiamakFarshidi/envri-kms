The main aim of this survey was to undertake a baseline assessment of the species & biotopes found in the area of interest. The survey comprised of 26video stations and 10 grab stations (3 repeatsper station) with 24 samples retainedfor infaunal analysis- the abundance & biomass was recorded. Particle size analysis (PSA) was alsocarried out butdue to low success rate ofgrab samples, only4 samples were appropriate for this analysis.
